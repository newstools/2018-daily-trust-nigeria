President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday evening broke the Ramadan fast with state governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in his official residence at Aso Rock, Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the “Iftar” with the governors, unlike the previous ones, held with leadership of the National Assembly, Judiciary and others, was not open for full media coverage. However, the official photographer to the President and cameraman from Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) were allowed to the venue of the event. Traditional rulers across the country are billed to be hosted by the President for the breaking of fast this week. (NAN)
