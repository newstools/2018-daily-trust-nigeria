The National Assembly has finally transmitted the final harmonised copy of the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.  Victor Nwokolo who is the Chairman Petroleum Upstream of the House of Representatives andÂ Comrade Akinlaja Joseph who is the Chairman Petroleum Committee Downstream in the House told newsmen on Friday President Buhari would have received the Bill by now.  The harmonised Bill was passed by both chambers in March 2018 but it could not be transmitted to the President by Clerk to the National Assembly due to a legal advice received from the National Assembly Legal Services Directorate, which observed some grey areas in the versions passed by the two chambers.  "Everything has been cleared, it should be at the president's table today bearing in mind that we are going on break today," Nwokolo who doubles as Deputy Chairman of the Adhoc Committee on the PIB said.  "It has gone through all the processes and the issue raised by the legal department has been properly taken care of. So, there is no hindrance anymore. All that is left is for the assent of Mr. president," he said.  Details later
