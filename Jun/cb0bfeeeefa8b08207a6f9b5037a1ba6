The National Security Adviser (NSA) Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (ret) has raised the alarm over the rising drug abuse in the country. He said despite efforts of national and international institutions, enormous amounts of drugs were still being produced, trafficked and consumed throughout the world. He spokes yesterday in Abuja at the 2018 International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking, themed, “Listen first: Listening to children and youth is the first step to help them grow healthy and safe” organised by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). Monguno regretted that Nigeria accounted for 20 percent of 1.6 billion pills of Tramadol seized globally in 2017 and that transnational crime syndicates manufactured new psycho-active substances, when governments stepped up control over existing drugs. Monguno, represented by AIG Ibekwe Abdallah, said the prevalence of Amphetamine, a stimulant, commonly referred to as synthetic drugs, was further aggravated by local manufacturing facilities. According to him, proceeds of illicit drug trade were being used to finance terrorism, instigate corruption, undermine economic development and erode state authority. Chairman of NDLEA, Col. Muhammad Abdallah (ret) said beyond clamping down on offenders, his agency was determined to enlighten the youths on the ills of drug abuse.
