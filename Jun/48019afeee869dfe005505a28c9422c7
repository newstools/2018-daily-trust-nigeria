Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara has called for integration of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in their host communities pending when they could return home. He made the call when flagging off a medical outreach organized in collaboration with the Institute of Human Virology, Nigeria (IHVN), and the Wesley Guild at the IDPs Camp in Karmajiji, Abuja. The speaker decried the poor living conditions at the IDPs camp saying “It is time for government to seek ways of integrating the IDPs instead of rushing them back to their communities, where they could be displaced again.” Responding to call by the director of the camp that the displaced persons would love to return home, Dogara said that was the goal of government but that it would be very difficult to return the IDPs before the war on terrorism is won. FCT Regional Manager of the Institute of Human Virology, Nigeria (IHVN), Dr Olayemi Olupitan  called on government to intensify efforts on awareness creation , HIV testing services and treatment care and support, adding that there was a global consensus to achieve the UNAIDS 95-95-95 strategy by 2030.
