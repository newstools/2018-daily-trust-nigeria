The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday declared the candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Adebo Ogundoyin as winner of the by-election for Ibarapa-East State Constituency. The seat became vacant following the death of the All Progressives Congress (APC) representative of the constituency, who was also the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Michael Adeyemo. It was gathered that the election which held amidst tight security was generally peaceful. The PDP candidate polled 6,277 as against his closest rival and brother to the late Speaker, Kunle Adeyemo of the ruling APC who scored 4, 619. The Accord candidate came third with 2, 859. The 31-year-old Adebo is the son of the late Eruwa-born philanthropist, Adeseun Ogundoyin, who died 27years ago.  He hailed from Eruwa with six wards as against Lanlate-born Adeyemo with four wards that make up Ibarapa-East local government. The APC had earlier lost two by-elections.
