A High Court in Abia State presided over by Justice C. O. Okoroafor has sacked the recently sworn in State Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led by  Donatus Nwankpa, saying Emmanuel Ndukwe remained the authentic chairman of the party in the state. The APC has two factions in the state. The faction that has Nwankpa as chairman is backed by a former governor, Chief Orji Uzor Kalu while the faction led by Dr. Ndukwe has the backing of Chief Ikechi Emenike, a party chieftain. Nwankpa had gone to the court seeking extension of time to vacate the court order issued on March 8, 2018 which restrained him from presenting himself as the Abia APC chairman. The then national chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun was also restrained from recognizing Nwankpa as chairman. Justice Okoroafor said the application filed for the vacation of the court order was incompetent and a nullity.  Nwamkpa said he had appealed against the ruling and urged party members to disregard it.
