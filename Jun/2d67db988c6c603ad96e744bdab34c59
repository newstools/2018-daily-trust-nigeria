Rimi Local government in Katsina has commenced the reactivation of 60 grounded boreholes to address water challenges bedevilling most of its communities. The head of the council, Hussaini Umar Rafindadi, told journalists that this will go a long way in addressing the perennial water problem facing the people who suffer a lot to get water for their daily needs. “These renewed efforts would not have been possible if not for the intervention of the state governor Aminu Masari who made funds available for these projects,” he said He said aside the reactivation, some new ones and hand pump boreholes are to be provided in some communities like Lambar Rimi and Abukur mosque.
