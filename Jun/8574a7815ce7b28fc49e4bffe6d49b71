A Federal High Court in Gusau has asked the Inspector General of Police to produce Zamfara State Commissioner of Police and the Divisional Police Officer, Central Division, Gusau before the court on June 11 over contempt charge. The order followed the failure of the officers to appear before the court on June 5 after contempt proceedings were initiated against them for refusing to release Zamfara State vehicles to the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON). Earlier, a judgment by the Federal High Court had dismissed the claim by the 14 local governments in Zamfara State over the attached vehicles. A Court of Appeal in Sokoto State had earlier ordered AMCON to attach and then auction property belonging to Zamfara State government over the latterâ€™s failure to repay N500m loan. AMCON will then invite independent professional valuers to value the vehicles for auctioning in order to recover the amount. Meanwhile, the case has been adjourned to Monday, June 11.
