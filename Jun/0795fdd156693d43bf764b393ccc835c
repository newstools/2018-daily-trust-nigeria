Bello Shagari, a grandson of former President Shehu Shagari, has declared his interest to contest for the seat of the president of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN). At the formal declaration in Sokoto, he said he was contesting to restore the lost glory of the council. "I am aware that people have lost confidence in the youth council. It is for that reason that I join the race to fix the problem,” he stated. Shagari added " I believe that it is possible to reform the council in order to serve its real purposes, especially now that the wind of change is blowing.” He said he would focus on internal reform, national unity, entrepreneurship, and sport development among others if elected at the forthcoming unity congress. Shagari also said that they would build national youth centres in all the 36 states and Abuja as well as revive and sustain voluntary youth clubs and organizations. He commended President Buhari for assenting to the Not Too Young To Run Bill, assuring that youth would support the ongoing fight against corruption in the country.
