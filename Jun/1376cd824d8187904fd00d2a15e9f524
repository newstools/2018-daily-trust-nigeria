In a bid to launch a maiden interactive verification portal for graduands to check and make inputs in the upcoming 2018 University of Jos convocation ceremony, a slight glitch may have caused the effort to go wrong. A few weeks to the ceremony which is slated for June 29 - 30, some students from the 2015/2016 session of the Faculty of Law reported that they were erroneously awarded first class degrees by the institution when only one of them actually made first class. The news of the glitch which circulated on the social media, forced the university to issue a statement explaining that the student list on its website was for verification, with the intent of “giving students the opportunity to preview the provisional list so as to make corrections on any clerical error observed as well as make suggestions and criticisms for future improvement.” Similarly, a statement issued by the Principal Assistant Registrar, Information and Publications, Abdullahi Abdullahi, stated that the interactive portal was the first of its kind in any Nigerian university, adding that, “Before now, based on the information available to us, no Nigerian university had put up information in the public domain through the web for graduating students to check and make their input. This shows transparency on the university’s part and should be encouraged rather than vilified.” Abdullahi also said “Because this is the university’s maiden deployment of such an interactive portal for its convocation, some initial hiccups and inadvertent errors are to be expected.”
