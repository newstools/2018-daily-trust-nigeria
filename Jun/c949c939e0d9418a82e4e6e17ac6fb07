Suspected armed bandits have killed at least 30 people in fresh attacks on Dutsin Wake and Oho villages in Birnin Magaji local government area of Zamfara State, residents told Daily Trust. But the spokesman of the state police command DSP Muhammad Shehu gave the figures of the casualties as 10, saying that seven were killed in Dutsen Wake and three corpses were recovered at Oho village. Yesterday’s carnage came two weeks after 23 people were killed in a similar raid on Zanuka village in Anka local government area of the state. Some weeks back, series of attacks on about 10 villages in Mada District of Gusau local government had forced hundreds of residents to flee their communities. Residents told Daily Trust that a suspected armed bandit was earlier caught and had his throat slit by vigilantes locally known as Yan Sakai at Nassarawa Gödel local market. Angered by the killing, the kinsmen of the slain armed bandit approached the leadership of the vigilante in the village demanding for the release of the man they suspected had carried out the killing. “But the vigilante leader told the angry armed bandits that he couldn’t identify who had killed their brother. The armed bandits later got a hint that those who partook in the killing of their kinsman were from the villages of Dutsen Wake and Oho,” A resident Hassan Bala said. He said they raided the two communities shooting everyone at sight in retaliation. They killed more than 20 in Dutsen Wake village and more than 10 in Oho community. The police said the armed bandits had retreated to Ruggu forest in the neighbouring Katsina State. “The state commissioner of police Mr Kenneth Ebrimson had spoken with his Katsina counterpart alerting him of the development,” he added.
