A non-profit organisation, Amaka Chiwuike-Uba Foundation (ACUF) has kicked off a monthly Youth Development and Leadership Workshop Series (YouDAL) which is geared towards training and building the capacity of youths on life planning skills and leadership. The Executive Director of the foundation, Chiwuike Uba said the training is to tackle some of the challenges facing the Nigerian youth. Uba stated that the YouDal Workshop Series will encourage youths to take up leadership responsibilities adding that it is aims to promote youth leadership development, education and employment, to support healthy lifestyle. He said, despite constituting more than 50 per cent of Nigeria’s population, over 60 per cent of the youth population is unemployed and very insignificant in government. “Arguably, the youth are neither equipped to seize present opportunities in leadership nor prepared/preparing to take future opportunities. It is incontrovertible that everyone has unique strengths and challenges that hinder them on the path of success,” he said. The workshop also provides the needed focus and context to a mentor pair. Therefore, to address this problem, ACUF’s inaugural YouDAL Workshop Series will focus on Visioning and Goal Setting”. He urged the youth to key into the programme as participation to the training workshop is free of charge. “However, due to limited available space, participation to the training workshop shall be only on registration to attend”.
