President Muhammmadu Buhari said while his critics have accused him of many things, they cannot accuse him of stealing. President Buhari declared that he had no regrets being a person of honesty and integrity. Buhari, according to his spokesman, Garba Shehu, spoke at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday while hosting a delegation of the Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria. The president said he was happy to have kept himself and people close to him from benefiting from government contracts. He said he did not award contracts and did not care about who got them so long as they did a good job at a justifiable cost. President Buhari also stated that if he had taken an oil well while serving as a minister of petroleum resources, he would have gone to jail. “I have appointed ministers and they are in charge. I appeal to their integrity. When they come here (Federal Executive Council Chambers), we ensure they follow the due process. If I owned an oil well, I would have gone to jail,” Buhari said. President Buhari told his visitors that he was in a difficult situation over appointments as adherents of different faiths alleged marginalisation. Speaking on behalf of the delegation, the vice president, Sheikh Hadiyyatullahi Abdulrashid, commended Buhari “for accomplishing much of what he promised before his election.”
