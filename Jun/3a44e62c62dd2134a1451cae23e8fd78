The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has denied releasing guidelines for presidential primaries ahead of the 2019 general election as reported in a national daily. The PDP in a statement by Mr Ike Abonyi, the Media Aide to its national chairman said it was still in the process of drawing up the guidelines and described the report as misleading. “The attention of the PDP has been drawn to a story in the Sunday Punch of June 17, 2018, titled, ‘PDP list guidelines for presidential aspirants, demands N12m for forms.’ý We wish to state categorically that the party is still in the process of drawing up the guidelines for its presidential primary election. “It is therefore misleading to claim that the party has ‘listed its guidelines’ not to talk of the cost of nomination forms. “At the appropriate time the proposals will be presented to NEC of the party which will approve as it deems fit. Only then can one say that it has the guidelines for the 2018 presidential primary election. “The National Working Committee of the PDP, under the leadership of Prince Uche Secondus, is committed to adhering strictly to the PDP Constitution and the constitution in Chapter 8 (50) (1) grants NEC the power to formulate the guidelines for aspirants in any of its party primaries, the presidential primary inclusive. “We therefore, urge the general public, party members and our esteemed presidential aspirants to disregard the said publications,” the party said.
