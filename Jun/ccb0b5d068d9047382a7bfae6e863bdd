The House of Representatives said yesterday that the complaints by President Muhammadu Buhari that some additions were made in the 2018 budget proposal submitted to the National Assembly were justifiable. However, the lawmakers said they were not expected to rubber-stamp the Executive arm as any budgetary proposal could be tinkered with. House spokesman Abdulrazak Namdas (APC, Adamawa) said in a statement that the House was appreciative of Buhari’s decision to sign the budget into law despite the complaints. “We are on the same page with Mr. President in his desire to return our budget cycle to January-December. By the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007, the budget estimates should be with the National Assembly around September of the year. “Going forward, we urge the Executive to speed up the reporting time to the National Assembly by complying fully with the FRA.” On new projects introduced in the budget, Namdas said: “We have to remind Mr. President that we are representatives of our people and wish to state that even the common man deserves a mention in the budget by including projects that will directly affect his life positively. “Some of the projects designed by the executive, as high-sounding as their names suggest, do not meet the needs of the common man.”
