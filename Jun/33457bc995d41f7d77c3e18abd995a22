Winners of the maiden edition of  Abuja 2018 Poetry Blast competition have emerged. Sharon Ephraim, Adebayo Danielle of Light of Day School, Kubwa and Kalu Chukwemeka Divine of Rayon Pris Success Academy, Dawaki were the winners. The director of Obagoo Kidzart, the organisers of the competition, Assumpta Kelvin, said over 50 schools in Abuja participated in the  competition. “The competition was keenly contested as there were many wonderful and incisive entries from children from different schools across the FCT. Some of the key criteria used included the writer’s ability to humanize nature, the extent to which the work relates and affects the human person; the beauty, flow and rhythm of language; poetic license and tone for poetry entrants; structure and organization of work; format and style and spelling and appropriate use of  punctuation marks,” she said.
