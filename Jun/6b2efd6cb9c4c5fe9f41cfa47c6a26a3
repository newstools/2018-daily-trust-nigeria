The Vice Chancellor of University of Jos, Prof. Seddi Sebastian Maimako yesterday said the lack of resources to secure the university boundaries was the cause of frequent encroachment by cattle herders. Prof. Maimako stated this during a press briefing on preparations for the university’s 29th and 30th combined convocation ceremonies in Jos. He said, “If you are not able to secure your property, people can walk in. So it is the same with the grazing activities, they (cattle readers) will tell you they don’t want anything but the grass and that it is a federal university so the grass belongs to the Federal Government, so we should not restrict them.” The VC however said while the university was toeing the path of peace and dialogue with the cattle rearers to keep away from the university community. Prof. Maimako said a comprehensive grandaunts list for the convocation was not ready due to meticulous efforts to ensure no mistakes were made but stated that a working figure for the two academic sessions stand at about 7,020 “excluding the affiliate institutions that are joining the University for the Convocation.” He said the retired Inspector General of Police and former Chairman of the Police Service Commission, Mike Okiro would be conferred with the Doctor Degree of Law; the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta would be conferred with Doctor of Science Degree and Chairman/CEO of Bajefta Nigeria Ltd, His Royal Highness, Eng. John Makwal will be conferred with Doctor of Engineering Degree.
