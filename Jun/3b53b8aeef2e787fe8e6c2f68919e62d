The Osun State Police Command has arrested three suspected kidnappers, Henry Omenihu, Paul Chituru and Henry Bright, who operate in army camouflage uniform. The state Commissioner of Police,  Mr Fimihan Adeoye paraded the three suspects at the police command headquarters in Osogbo, yesterday. The police boss said the suspects kidnapped one Mr Kayode Agbeyangi and Mrs Oyeyemi Obafemi along the Ilesa/Ibadan expressway on April 14, 2018. He said the victims were traveling on the highway when the suspects shot the tyre of their Toyota Camry car. “As a result, the car stopped and the occupants alighted. The occupants of the car wanted to change the tyre and continue their journey but the suspects who were dressed in army uniform came out of the bush and kidnapped them,” he said. The suspects kept their victims in captivity for four days and eventually collected a ransom of N2 million from the victims’ relatives before they were released. CP Adeoye said the suspects collected the ransom at Emuoha, River State. He added that one AK47 rifle with double magazine, fully loaded with ammunition and four pairs of army camouflage uniforms were recovered from the suspects. The commissioner said the matter is still under investigation and that the suspects would be charged to court as soon as possible.
