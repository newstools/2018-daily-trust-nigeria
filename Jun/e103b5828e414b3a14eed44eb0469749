A 28-year-old man identified as Shehu was arrested for allegedly attempting to steal a cow at Yewuti village, near Abaji. A witness, Yahaya Ibrahim, said the suspect was arrested on Wednesday evening after he allegedly went to a Fulani settlement near Yewuti village to steal a cow. Ibrahim said the suspect, who resided at Gegu town in Kogi State, invaded the Fulani settlement and took away a cow, but that one of the herders sighted him. “The suspect never knew one of the herders had already seen him after he successfully moved the cow into the bush and tied it to a tree,” he said. He said the suspect came back at about 6:00pm in order to untie the cow when two herders hiding inside the  bush went after him and  he took to his heels. “It was in Abaji that he was arrested by some youths who almost lynched him and was immediately handed over to the police,” he said. The Abaji Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Tersoo Tile, could not be reached on phone, but a police officer who confirmed the arrest. He said the suspect would be charged to court after investigation had been concluded.
