The world’s foremost chemical weapons watchdog has granted itself new powers to assign blame for attacks, despite protests by Russia. Until now, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) could only say whether chemical weapons were used - but not who had used them. Britain successfully argued that new powers were needed to deal with repeated chemical attacks in Syria. Russia said the move went “beyond the mandate” of the watchdog. It also said the organisation was facing an “artificially created crisis”. The members of the OPCW, however, voted in large numbers for the measure, winning the vote by 82 to 24 - exceeding the two-thirds majority needed. Britain proposed the measure, and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it would “strengthen the ban on chemical weapons and prevent impunity for their use”. Repeated allegations of chemical weapon use by Syria’s government against rebels and civilians brought the issue into the international spotlight in recent months. In April, the United States, UK, and France jointly bombed three Syrian government sites in response to the alleged chemical attacks.
