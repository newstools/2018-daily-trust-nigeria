An FCT High Court in Gudu has found former Governor of Plateau State, Senator Joshua Dariye guilty of misappropriation of his state's funds. Justice Adebukola Banjoko found that Dariye as a public servant entrusted with and having dominion over N1.1billion ecological funds for Plateau state was guilty with the manner the cheque was cleared and disbursed contrary to the real intent of the fund. The court also found him guilty of causing Plateau state a loss to the tune of over N600million out of the N1.1bn ecological fund. The court found that only N550million out of the N1.1bn was paid by Dariye to Plateau State Government. He was found to have diverted N160million to Ebenezer Retina Ventures, a company owned by him. As at the time of filing this report, the judge is still reading the judgement. Dariye has so far been found guilty on Counts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 & 7. He has gone to pee again, as theÂ Court is on break.
