Senate Leader, Ahmad Lawan, yesterday, said President Muhammadu Buhari is a phenomenon, adding that his persona is now a movement and not a single personality. Hosting members of the North East Youth Coalition for President Buhari (NEYCPB) in his office, Sen. Lawan said Buhari was an attitude to life. “Buhari is a phenomenon; it’s a movement.  What I mean here, let me not be misquoted. When I said Buhari is not a man, Buhari is an attitude to life, what is that attitude? Integrity and commitment. “He came into politics not to make money. It is our duty as citizens not to allow the president to do it alone. No matter how you are, how equipped you are, when it comes to leadership and administration, especially of a country that is as complex Nigeria, you need every hand to be on deck. “That is what we are trying to do; that is what the coalition is seeking to do. When the president came in 2015, the first actions he took were necessary to rescue and secure the North East. “The North East has been rescued. Insurgency, once it starts, it doesn’t stop like when rain starts and stops. You will always find from time to time some signs that they are still there. But the signs have been reduced to suicide bombing of soft targets, not declaring a caliphate with headquarters in Bama or anywhere else. We really owe gratitude to our president,” he said. He said Buharism was delivery of services in transparent and accountable manner. Leader of the group, Engr. Abdullahi Auwal, said they had appointed Lawan as their grand patron.
