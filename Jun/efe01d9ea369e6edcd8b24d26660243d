The Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has condemned the reduction by the National Assembly of the take-off grant of N5 billion for the Nigerian Maritime University, Okerenkoko, Delta State provided for by President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2018 budget. In the same breadth, the group frowned upon the refusal and non-implementation of financial provision in the Act establishing the Federal University of Petroleum Resources (FUPRE), Effurun. In an eight-point resolution reached after a crucial meeting of group weekend and signed by the National Secretary, Dr. Alfred Mulade, PANDEF pointed out that both institutions, located in Delta State are specialised universities with the mandate to train high calibre manpower in the Maritime and Oil/Gas Industries in Nigeria. “These actions of the National Assembly are capable of truncating the laudable objectives upon which these universities were established. It is quite disheartening to note that the less than adequate budgetary provision of N5billion for the take-off of the Nigerian University, Okerenkoko, was ridiculously slashed to a paltry N3.4billion. This is unacceptable. “To add to this is the very disappointing non-financial implementation of the Federal Petroleum University of Petroleum Resources (FUPRE Act) is an affront and defeat on the realisation of the core mandate of this institution,” the body stated. PANDEF called on President Buhari and the leadership of the National Assembly, to take the necessary steps for the smooth take-off of the maritime university and to implement the financial provision for the FUPRE, by way of a Supplementary Budget as envisaged by the president.
