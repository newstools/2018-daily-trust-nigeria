Seven people have been allegedly killed by gunmen in a fresh attack on Tseadough settlement of Mbachom community in Yaav Ward of Kwande Local Government Area of Benue State. Daily Trust gathered that the gunmen suspected to be herders militia attacked the affected rural settlement at 12:30am yesterday while the inhabitants had retired to sleep and shot sporadically, killing the deceased and injuring many others. Chairman of Kwande LGA, Terdoo Nyor Kenti, told newsmen in Makurdi that the armed militia also took a woman from the village captive while they burnt several houses in the area. Kenti said the attack on his domain was worrisome as there were no prior disagreement between the locals and the herders who he accused invaded the armless people without the slightest provocation. At the time of sending this report, the State Police Commissioner, Fatai Owoseni, could not be reached on his telephone while his spokesman, ASP Moses Joel Yamu did not respond to his calls. Meanwhile, the North-Central Zonal Chairman of Myetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Alhaji Danladi Chiroma, told Daily Trust by telephone that the killings could not have been done by suspected herders. "No herders are in Tiv land again. They have relocated to Nasarawa and Kogi states, those still remaining in Benue can only be found in Idoma land where they are cohabiting peacefully with their host communities. I wonder why they will suspect herders there again. Since the military began operation, the herders in all Tiv land relocated. I however really sympathise with them over the happenings there but the killers are not herders," Chiroma said.
