About 2,172,467 voters have collected their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in Rivers State, the state’s Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Obo Effanga, has said. Mr Effanga said this yesterday when he visited Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike at the Government House in Port Harcourt. He said the state has more than three million registered voters. “We are 248 days to the 2019. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is committed to credible polls. But credible elections depend on so many factors including the stakeholders. We expect the stakeholders to play by the rules,” he said. Governor Wike accused both INEC and Police of being responsible for electoral fraud in the country. He said if the two agencies play by the electoral rules, elections will be credible and peaceful. The governor said conflicts arise when INEC fails to do the right thing and bows to pressure from politicians. He said the PDP in Rivers State will not bring any pressure on INEC because of the high performance of his administration.
