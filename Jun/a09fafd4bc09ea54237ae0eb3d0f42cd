The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Adamu Danze, has emphasised the need for young people to acquire skills. The chairman was speaking when the entourage from the Abuja Enterprise Agency (AEA), led by its Managing Director, Malam Muhammed Tukur Arabi, paid him a courtesy call in his office on Tuesday. “In Nigeria today, the highest gift you can give somebody is to train him or her to have a skill and be established on his or  her own.  That is the highest gift you can give,” he said. He added that it was the responsibility of the council to take care of its youths and that he was glad that they found an agency that would help out. In his response, the MD of the AEA, Mal. Tukur Arabi, said the agency would partner with the council to  help train the youths in different skills and also empower some of them. “There is no person that cannot learn a skill. If you sponsor the youths for our trainings, we will train them and after that, we will empower them, they will never come to you again for stipends,” he said.
