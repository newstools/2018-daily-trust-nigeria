The kidnappers of yet-to-be-ascertained number of persons along the Birnin Gwari- Kaduna road have placed a demand of N1 million on each person they are holding captive. The abductors had made phone contact with officials of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), in Birnin Gwari, Friday evening and demanded for N5 million on each person. One of the officials of the union who does not want to be named,  told our correspondent that the kidnappers called again Saturday morning, to restate the demand and after negotiations with the officials came down to N2 million and later N1 million. “That is the point we have reached on the negotiation so far,” he said. The police had on Friday said two persons were shot in a gun battle between the police and bandits along the Birnin Gwari-Kaduna road and that the driver of the vehicle and a woman were abducted. But officials of the NURTW said about 25 persons were abducted. The police public relations officer when contacted said he is not aware of any ransom demanded but said the police is leaving no stone unturned to see to the rescue of the victims. He said there’s a special anti-kidnap unit that is working to unravel the case.
