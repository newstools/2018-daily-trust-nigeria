France has warned that “fits of anger” cannot not dictate international cooperation after US President Donald Trump abruptly rejected a previously agreed joint statement in the wake of a fractious Group of Seven (G7) summit in Canada. “We spend two days working out a (joint) statement and commitments. We are sticking to them and whoever reneges on them is showing incoherence and inconsistency,” President Emmanuel Macron’s office said on Sunday in a statement to AFP news agency. Minutes after the publication on Saturday of the joint communique that was approved by all the leaders in the G7 bloc Trump announced on Twitter that he was retracting his support. In a flurry of tweets from Air Force One, en route to Singapore for a historic summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, Trump accused Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister and host of the summit in Quebec, of being “very dishonest”.
