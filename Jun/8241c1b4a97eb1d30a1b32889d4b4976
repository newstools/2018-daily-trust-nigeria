A leader of the #Not Too Young To Run Movement and the Executive Director of the Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth and Advancement (YIAGA-Africa), Samson Irish, said the signing of the bill into law is the beginning of a new phase for Nigerian youths participation in politics and governance. He told Daily Trust last night that one of the movement’s priorities was to get registered political parties to affirm at least 30 percent for youths for all electable positions in the country. “We thank Mr President, National Assembly, all Nigerians and others for this feat. What we expect were 30 years and not 35 for the Presidency, same for Senate and Governorship. The House of Representatives and the state houses of assembly were good at 25. We would work on the parties to create enabling environment for the youths through internal party democracy and non tolerance for imposition,” he said. The spokesman of YIAGA-Africa, Moshood Utah, said the movement would not form a political party but work with existing registered parties through the platform of “Ready To Run Movement” and that they would also be asking for the immediate gazetting of the bill to ensure its implementation for the 2019 elections.
