The Executive Director, African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) Abuja Dr. Otive Igbuzor said he does not buy into the argument that President Muhammadu Buhari is selective in the fight against corruption. He said the mistake the All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Buhari made was not telling Nigerians what its change agenda entailed during electioneering campaign. Otive, who spoke in an interview with journalists in Benin yesterday, said this was the same argument people put forward during the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) regime. He said “People should not worry because no regime stands for ever, but anybody who has stolen money, whoever is held for corruption, should prove his innocence. The idea why am I the only one being prosecuted doesn’t make sense.” He said the federal government has woken up in the fight against corruption, adding that all Nigerians need is to hope that he will continue in this manner because the people need the stolen fund to provide services and  relief from the menace of corruption. “In everywhere in the world where change processes have been initiated 70 percent of them have failed partly because people don’t understand the change process and there is always resistance to change,” he said. He said on the average the administration is pushing well, especially in the area of fight against corruption.
