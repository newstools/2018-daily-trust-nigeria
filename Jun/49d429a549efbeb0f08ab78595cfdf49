Speaking when he led a delegation of investors on a visit to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Mr Boss Mustapha, yesterday, leader of the team, Terey Molelawn said first stage of the project would kick off with $3bn. He said in the next 90 days there would be ground breaking of the project, saying the consortium would provide funding and were determined to assist NNPC with pipelines to connect to the grid. Molelawn said they were in the office of the SGF to seek government’s support in acquiring license and in getting gas for the power project. The SGF told the delegation that Nigeria was ready to provide various incentives to foreign investors in housing and power distribution. “We want to invite the whole world to come and invest in Nigeria. As a country and government, we are interested in issuance of any license and we will treat it with dispatch,” the SGF said in a statement by a spokesman in his office, Mr Andrew Agyo Uhwe. He assured the investors and international partners of government preparedness in welcoming any individual that has genuine interest to do business in the country, saying government has provided an enabling environment for such investment to thrive.
