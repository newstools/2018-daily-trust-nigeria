The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), on Wednesday, said it has resolved its leadership crisis, warning that the intricacies surrounding the disunity would no longer be tolerated or condoned. The leadership of the council has been a subject of crisis over the years and series of previous attempts to resolve the crisis amicably didn’t yield desired results. NYCN’s factional leaders, Murtala Muhammad Garba and Abdurl-Rahman Agboola, in a statement they jointly signed in Abuja, said the divisive crises that have engulfed the council over the years have been resolved to move it forward. “The polarization of the apex youth body in Nigeria is considered as a disservice to the great sacrifices of its fore bearers and Nigerian youth whose interest NYCN represents. “As a result of the factional crises, the prestige and reputation of NYCN to undertake notable responsibilities to foster growth and development of Nigerian youth has been under attack by the hijackers benefitting from the impasse,” the factional leaders said. They said the council had suspended all actions of the proposed congresses until full harmonization of the leadership is completed. They noted that any congress without due process would further throw the council into more leadership crisi. “It is very essential to conduct a unity congress where all state chapters and affiliate voluntary youth organisations will participate, and to achieve this, the leadership of both factions have resolved for proper harmonization of the two leadership as one,” they added. Meanwhile, the council said it had informed the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to deregister the new trustees purportedly registered on November 3, 2017 to change the original trustees of NYCN. The council said the documents submitted to the commission upon which the change was effected were forged by the purported new Trustees.
