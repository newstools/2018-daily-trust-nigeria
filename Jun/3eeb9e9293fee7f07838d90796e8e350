The Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) has said it is worried over open defecation in Abuja, especially at the  Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps in the FCT. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) discovered that no fewer than 6,000 persons living at Dagban and Wassa IDP camps in the FCT lack access to toilet facilities. Head of Department of Environmental Health and Safety, AEPB, Mr. Simeon Ajueyitsi, told NAN in Abuja on Thursday that the board was worried about the unhygienic practice. Mr. Ajueyitsi said the sanitary conditions of the IDP camps in the FCT were horrible as the environment was contaminated by poor sanitation and open defecation. “Without deceiving ourselves, the FCT Emergency Management Agency (FCT-EMA) is the sole body responsible for the plight of the IDPs in the camps. However, due to the fact that there is no act of parliament supporting it, it is now a department, but they are the ones in charge. Ajueyitsi said the unsanitary environment could spur the outbreak of water-borne diseases and food contamination, stressing the need for the FCTA to rise up to the challenge and improve the living conditions of the IDPs. He, however, said a report was already being collated to address perceptible areas of intervention in Abuja, adding that the overall goal of the AEPB was to scale up hygiene promotion practices in the FCT. Ajueyitsi said the board also had a list of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) needs in all the satellite towns of Abuja, adding, however, that there was need for improved collaboration between relevant stakeholders to promote hygienic practices in the FCT.
