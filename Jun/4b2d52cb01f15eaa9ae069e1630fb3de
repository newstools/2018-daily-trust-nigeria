The Emir of Katsina, Abdulmumin Kabir Usaman, has called for the enactment of stringent laws to deal with drug related offences in the state. Speaking at the Hawan Bariki Durba, the emir lamented the increasing involvement of youth and women in drugs, noting that all hands must be on deck to address the challenge. He noted that the subsequent neglect of the traditional institution has compounded security challenges, saying that “we must return to the old system when village and ward heads were empowered to report and document happenings in their respective domains”. In his remarks, the state governor, Aminu Masari assured of his administration’s readiness to re-position the traditional institution with a view to making it more viable and efficient. Masari added that for the war against drug abuse to be won, it must start from homes, urging parents to rise up to their responsibilities.
