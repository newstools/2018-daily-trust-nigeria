Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has criticised the United States for “imposing its policies on the rest of the world”. Speaking at an international summit in the Chinese city of Qingdao on Sunday, Rouhani said the US’ withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal poses a potential threat to the world. “The recent example of such unilateralism and the defiance of the decisions of the international community by the US government is its withdrawal from the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name of the nuclear deal),” Rouhani said during the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a regional security pact in which Iran has observer status. Russian President Vladimir Putin also criticised the US for its withdrawal, claiming the decision could potentially destabilise the situation.
