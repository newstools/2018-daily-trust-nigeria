Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Ahmed has called for love - not war - with long-standing rival Eritrea. Speaking on television after hosting an Eritrean delegation for dinner on Tuesday night, Mr Abiy said: “Love is the only way out. We have tried war, it didn’t benefit either side. It cost lives, time, money - and it diverts attention from other important things.” Tens of thousands of people were killed during a 1998-2000 war between the two countries for control of the town of Badme. Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki was not at the talks, but he sent a high-level delegation - which included his political adviser Yemane Gebreab - to Ethiopia in an attempt to end the border dispute. Mr Yemane said both countries had closed a sad chapter, and a new one was opening.
