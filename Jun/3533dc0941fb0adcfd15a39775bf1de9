An Osun magistrate’s court sitting in Ile-Ife on Tuesday remanded a 72-year-old man in prison for allegedly bathing a woman with acid. The accused, Adegboye Emmanuel, who was arraigned on a two-count charge of attempted murder and causing grievous harm through acid, was remanded in prison after he pleaded not guilty to the charge. Magistrate Ishola Omisade rejected the oral application for bail by Emmanuel’s counsel, Mr Bolaji Adewale. He ordered the remand of the accused at Ile-Ife prison. Omisade, however, asked Adewale to file a formal bail application for the court’s consideration and adjourned the case till July 12. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp Emmanuel Abdullahi, had told the court that the accused committed the offence on June 6  at about 9:00am at Oluorogbo phase III on  Ondo road, Ile-Ife. Abdullahi alleged that the accused unlawfully attempted to kill one Abayomi Veronica who he  poured   a substance suspected to be acid on, causing her  grievous harm. The prosecutor said the offence contravened sections 320 (2) and 338 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2002. (NAN)
