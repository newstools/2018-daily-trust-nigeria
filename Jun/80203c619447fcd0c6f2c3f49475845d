The Methodist Archbishop of Abuja, Most Rev. Oche Job, said President Muhammadu Buhari will be appreciated after his departure from office. “People may not praise him now but by the time he lives the seat, and somebody comes in and they begin to do comparison, they will say if it were in the time of Buhari, oh my God, this thing would have been this,” he said. The Archbishop also said he admires President Muhammadu Buhari’s courage as a man that ‘fears no one’. The clergyman, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja yesterday, said if Buhari “Is a man who fears what people will say, by now, he would have become very nervous.” The archbishop’s remark was sequel to the recent signing of four bills into laws by Buhari. The President had on June 8, assented to the Constitution Fourth Alteration Bill, which grants financial autonomy to State Houses of Assembly and the states’ Judiciary nationwide. The law is to ensure that the budgetary allocations of the states’ Houses of Assembly and the judiciary will no longer go through the budgeting process of the executive arm at the state level, but will  be transferred directly to the their accounts. Buhari also signed into law the Bill No. 16 which stipulates that where a Vice-President succeeds a President or a Deputy Governor succeeds a Governor, he or she can no more contest for that office more than once. Other bills signed into laws were the Constitution Amendment No. 21, which relates to determination of pre-election matters and the Bill No. 9 which gives the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) sufficient time to conduct bye-elections. “For sure, I commend him. You see, Buhari fears no one and that’s why I like him. He makes up his mind and says and does what he thinks is the best for the nation,” the clergyman said. He said the financial autonomy for the states’ legislators and judicial officers would ensure accountability at the state level. (NAN)
