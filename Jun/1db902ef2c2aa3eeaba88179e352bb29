Former Katsina State governor Ibrahim Shema has filed two applications seeking to stop his alleged money laundering trial before a Federal High Court in Katsina. Shema was arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) on allege 26-count charge totalling about N5.7bn of Subsidy Reinvestment Programme (SURE-P) At the sitting yesterday, Shema’s counsel, Joseph Daudu SAN, drew the attention of the court to the two motions on abuse of court processes and that of jurisdiction. He said the EFCC is pursuing a similar case against one Salisu Ingawa at a state High Court and also a party in this matter, noting that pursuing two similar cases at the same time was wrong. However, EFCC’s counsel, Sam Olugunorisa SAN, objected to the application, saying it will amount to delay in justice insisting that both cases can go simultaneously as they cannot affect each other as those standing trial at the state High Court differ from those here at the Federal High Court. In his ruling, Justice Babagana Ashgar said, in accordance  with the Criminal Justice Act sec 3, 96 (2), ruling on the application shall be taken along with the final judgement at the completion of trial. He adjourned the case to Oct 15 and 16 this year for commencement of trial.
