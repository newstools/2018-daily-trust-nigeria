In a statement by his spokesman Femi Adesina, Buhari joins Ogwashiukwu community in Delta State, immediate and extended Okonjo family, professional colleagues and friends of His Royal Highness in celebrating the cerebral scholar whose imprint on education in Nigeria and beyond remain indelible.     Adesina stated "The President extols the sterling educational and leadership qualities of Prof. Okonjo who pursued knowledge with interest and vigour from his youth, obtaining a first degree in mathematics as an external student, and following up with two Masters degrees in Economics and Statistics, and a Doctorate in Mathematical Statistics.    "President Buhari believes the traditional ruler has sowed in many lives as a teacher, mentor and leader, particularly wielding a strong influence over his children and grand-children who have turned out to be national and global icons by reputably serving the nation in various capacities." "He prays that the Almighty God will grant the Obi of Ogwashiukwu longer life, more strength and good health to keep serving humanity."
