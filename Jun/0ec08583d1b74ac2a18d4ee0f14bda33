Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, yesterday raised the alarm over emergence of what he described as “overnight religious leaders” in Nigeria’s two main religions. He said this while speaking at the first international conference by the interreligious council of the University of Ilorin, where he noted that the people preached errors and had led many people astray. “We have a major problem these days in our country where it seems everyone can become a ‘religious leader’ overnight, without any credentials. There are too many ignorant ‘pastors’ and ‘imams’ preaching errors and leading many people astray. Perhaps this is the price we have to pay for the freedom of religion that we enjoy. But surely a line should be drawn somewhere, especially when national order and harmony is at stake,” he said. In his paper, titled, religious harmony and nation building, the cleric said religious harmony is possible in Nigeria, adding that, without it, it would hardly be possible to build a strong and united nation. He also canvassed training and restraining of religious leaders to ensure preaching that would encourage religious harmony among adherents of religions, particularly in local communities. Also speaking, the secretary general of the Nigeria Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) and JAMB registrar, Professor Ishaq Oloyede, called on Nigerians to concretize interfaith relationship to achieve the purpose for which religion was institutionalized. He said the multi-religious nature of Nigeria is a divine design of the Creator to test whether mankind would be able to harmonize its differences or not.
