The report of a lady jumping into the lagoon on June 10, 2018 might be false. Already, the police and the state Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) have dismissed the trending video that the woman who jumped into the lagoon was the owner of the Ford Explorer. The police said the owner of the jeep was a passer-by who parked to offer help. However, two weeks after the incident, the body of the suspected person has not been found by divers deployed to search for it. Commissioner of Police Edgal Imohimi, while responding to question on the case during his recent briefing, said: “As I speak to you, even though we have reduced the number of divers making periodic dives to try to get the purported body but none has been found till date, there is nothing to substantiate any of the stories you have been hearing. So, what I think we should do is to just keep all those stories until we get hard facts for you”, said the CP. “The vehicle that was you saw parked on the bridge was announced to also be a passerby who stopped when he saw people gathering.” He also said that none of the people gathered could give a clear description of the person who jumped into the water. “It was just hearsay that it is a woman”, he said. The Police Commissioner said: “There is one thing that is certain and that is the report from my Marine Unit because the officer in charge of the unit deplored all the divers to search for the body and of course if somebody goes into the lagoon, within two days, the body will be washed out, the body will float.” “So as at now, we will not confirm any death until I see a body either dead or alive. So I don’t want anybody to presume and as soon we have credible information concerning that matter, I will give it to the press”, he said.
