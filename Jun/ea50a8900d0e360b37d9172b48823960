A Spanish court has sentenced Cristiano Ronaldo to a two-year jail term. However, Ronaldo has reportedly accepted a suspended prison sentence to settle his tax fraud case.

The Real Madrid superstar was accused by Spanish prosecutors in June last year of defrauding tax authorities of €14.8m (£12.9m).

Ronaldo denied the alleged tax evasion when he appeared in court last summer but the case has still not been settled.

His initial offer was reportedly rejected last month but El Mundo claim he has accepted a prison sentence and admitted his guilt, in exchange for a reduced charge.

He will also pay a sum amounting to exactly €18.8m (£16.4m).

Having had no previous convictions, Ronaldo would not serve any time in jail.

Ronaldo was initially demanded to pay the complete sum up he is alleged to have evaded up front, but an agreement has been reached to pay just €5.7m (£5m)

The rest of the total will be paid in fines and interests until it totals €18.8m.

The agreement hasn't yet been signed but once done will settle the long-running case.

Ronaldo will be involved when Portugal open their World Cup account against Spain on Friday night.

The European champions take on Spain in Group B and will fancy their chances after the shock departure of Julen Lopetegui this week.

Fernando Hierro will take charge of this one after Lopetegui agreed to take the Real Madrid job.
