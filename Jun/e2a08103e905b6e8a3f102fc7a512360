President Muhammadu Buhari has taunted those clamouring for Nigeria’s restructuring, saying they have their own agenda. The president was speaking at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday while hosting traditional rulers and other Urhobo stakeholders led by a 101-year-old Ohworode of Olomu Kingdom, Ogbon-Ogoni Oghoro I, Dr Laiyeguen. Responding to a request by his visitors that he should allow the nation’s restructuring, the president queried the constitutionality of the agitation. He said, “You mentioned something which is topical these days, the calls for restructuring Nigeria. Every group asking for restructuring has got its own agenda, and I hope it can be accommodated by the Constitution.” The president, who assured his visitors that his administration did not forget their kingdom, vowed to deal with officers selling Urhobo lands given to the military. He urged the Urhobo to protect oil installations in their areas and extended to his government, a similar cooperation given the previous administration. The president said the stakeholders’ request for his intervention on the festering boundary dispute between Edo and Delta States was a constitutional matter. Speaking to State House reporters later, one of the leaders of Urhobo, Olorogu Taiga, said their people would vote Buhari in 2019 if he granted their requests.
