Former minister of education, Oby Ezekwesili has written President Muhammadu Buhari calling on him to stop killings by armed bandits in parts of the country. Ezekwesili in the correspondence titled, ‘It is time to act-enough is totally and truly enough’ said though several Nigerians have been killed in the first half of this year, there was no ‘sense of urgency by government to end the abnormality.’ She listed eighteen actions the President needed to take to stop the killings saying “I have a simple question for you today. Are you by any strange possibility in need of the spilt blood of your citizens? I personally reckon that the answer to this outlandish question, which some of your citizens are now asking in utter frustration is no. “If therefore your own response is no as I direly hope it is, I have a few demands to make on you to stop the killings now.” The former minister asked the President to among other things, “Stop the daily killing of Nigerians by terrorist-herdsmen now! Nigeria must not be changed into a vast killing field under your watch, Mr President.” She also asked the President ensure justice to all those killed and commission an urgent independent research and study into the root causes of the crisis.
