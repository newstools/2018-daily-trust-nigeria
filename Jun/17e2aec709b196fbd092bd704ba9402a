Residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)  have been urged to join the campaign against non-degradable materials by scaling down the use and disposal of plastics. This call was made by the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, during the 2018 World Environment Day celebrations yesterday in Abuja. Malam Bello noted that there was increasing amount of harmful waste, especially plastics, that dominated the environment. The minister, who was represented by the Coordinator, Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC), Umar Shuaibu, noted that the theme for this year’s event which centred on beating plastics pollution, was a wake-up call for rethinking the existing waste management strategies, especially on plastic waste. He said the campaign should not be a task for government alone, urging the partnership of individuals, communities, private sector, as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the current campaign. “We believe that a more comprehensive national policy against the use and disposal of plastics is urgently required. We, therefore, align ourselves with the current global effort to beat plastics and other forms of pollution. “In the FCT, we shall continue to take very proactive steps to ameliorate these hazards; we are working to increase  general awareness among the populace on the consequences of disposal of plastics on the environment,” he stressed.
