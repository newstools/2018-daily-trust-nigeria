Recent ban of production and consumption of codeine drugs by the Federal Government has drastically reduced the consumptiopn of the illicit drug, NDLEA Assistant ‎Commander, Sokoto state command, Amos Bamidele has said. He stated this Wednesday while speaking on this year’s World Drugs Day. "It does not‎ mean you will not find these drugs in the market, but not in the volume as you used to see it before,” he added. Bamidele noted that the drop in supply had made the price to escalate. “A bottle that used to sell for N800 now cost N2000. In this case, it is not everybody that is able‎ to buy it, because it can only be found with smugglers and black marketers," he said. On insinuation in some quarters that it is  a thing of northern Nigeria alone, he explained:  "It is not only in Nigeria that people abuse drugs and it is not only in Sokoto that people abuse drugs in Nigeria. There is no state in Nigeria that is drugs consumption free.” He added:"It is only that consumption of specific drugs differs‎ in Nigeria.” The Assistant ‎Commander observed that in Sokoto, abuse of drugs such as Codeine, Tramadol, are nore rampant, while  Cannabis is more abused in places such as  Lagos and Edo, than cough syrup.”
