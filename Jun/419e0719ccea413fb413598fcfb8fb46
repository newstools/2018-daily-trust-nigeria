The Chief Imam of Ibadanland, Sheikh Abdul-Ganiyy Agbotomokekere observed this year’s Eid el-fitri yesterday in defiance of the directive from the Nigerian Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs (NSCIA). The Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, was also at the praying ground, at Agodi Gate area of Ibadan. The Muslim Ummah of South West Nigeria (MUSWEN) on Thursday in a statement signed by its executive secretary/CEO, Prof Dawud O. S. Noibi, requested all stakeholders to fully comply with NSCIA’s directive. He said at the end of Ramadan 1439H, all Islamic stakeholders should search for crescent of the month of Shawwal 1439H which shall be after sunset on Thursday, 14th June, 2018. “By NSCIA’s directive, the 29th day of Ramadan falls on Thursday, 14th June, 2018. As such, the search for the crescent for the month of Shawwal 1439H shall be after sunset on Thursday, 14th June, 2018.” However, there were prayers in some parts of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital led by the Chief Imam of the city. All efforts to speak with the chief imam failed as his aides didn’t allow him to grant media interview. A member of the congregation who also observed prayer at the Agodi praying ground, Akeem Olabiyi, said many attendees started their fasting a day before others.
