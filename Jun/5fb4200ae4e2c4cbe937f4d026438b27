Swiss voters have overwhelmingly backed a new gambling law which would block foreign betting sites, according to early results. The new Gambling Act won the support of 72% of voters, according to projections, despite accusations that the law amounts to online censorship. Due to take effect in 2019, the act permits only Swiss-certified casinos and gaming companies to operate there. The government says it is designed to tackle gambling addiction. Both houses of parliament have already passed the legislation. While the bill will let Swiss companies offer online gambling for the first time, it will also block all foreign betting sites in the country, something opponents say amounts to “censorship of the internet”. Various youth wings from political parties garnered the 50,000 signatures necessary to stage the referendum in an attempt to overturn the act.
