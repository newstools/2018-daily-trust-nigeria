Bauchi State government has been urged to implement the Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS) approved by Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar as well as improve other working conditions.  ‎ Chairman of National Association of Government General Medical and Dental Practitioners (NAGGMDP) Bauchi state branch, Dr,Musa Yusuf made the appeal in Bauchi shortly after the Association's emergency congress held at Bauchi Specialist Hospital.  He also called on the government to also address the irregularities of NAGGMDP members regarding their May 2018 salary especially those who are yet to be paid.  He further urged the state government to look into the salary issue and correct the irregularities like salary cuts, irregular and improper increment to some member.  Yusuf commended Gov Mohammed Abubakar for approving the new salary scale for members of his Association since 2017.  He however lamented that despite the approval the salary scale is yet to be implemented.  "We are begging all stakeholders in the health sector to ensure this salary scale is speedily implemented.  "It has become imperative in view of the doctors' role in promoting the health of the people and other challenges we face in our day-to- day activities.  "There is need for Government to encourage medical practitioners and improve their welfare so as to prevent them from seeking greener pastures elsewhere, “he said.  He said that members of the association have after their emergency congress resolved to give the state government a 21 days ultimatum within which to address their problems or face industrial action as the issues have been lingering for a long time.  "The ultimatum is with effect from May 15, 2018. But we are still appealing to stakeholders and members of the general public to ensure that the in patients and others requiring medical attention do not suffer unjustly, "Dr Yusuf reiterated. ‎
