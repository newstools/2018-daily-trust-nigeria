The Edo Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Anthony Oko, has blamed incessant road crashes on impatience and over speeding on the part of drivers. He said the command had set up an intervention team to check the violation of traffic rules by motorists and reduce accidents in the state. Oko, who disclosed this in Benin yesterday, said the team would be deployed to strategic locations across the state to bring sanity to the roads. “We are going to engage in public education in the communities so that they will be alert and when a crash happens, especially in the early morning and at night, they will move in and assist the victims,” he said. The sector commander assured that he would continue to collaborate with the state government and other security agencies to reduce accidents on the roads.
