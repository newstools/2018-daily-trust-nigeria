A former Minister of Sports and Special Duties, Prof. Taoheed Adedoja said yesterday that he asked his lawyers, Messrs. Rickey Tarfa and Co. to withdraw a suit he filed against the PDP because top party leaders prevailed on him to do so. The former minister had filed a suit at an Abuja Federal High Court, challenging the election of Prince Uche Secondus as National Chairman of the party after the December 2017 National Convention of the party. Speaking with newsmen yesterday in Abuja, Adedoja who was one of the chairmanship contenders at the convention also said he withdrew the case in the spirit of the month of Ramadan, which he said is a month of forgiveness. “I am not asking for any compensation whatsoever from the party as only the Almighty can compensate any human being for his deeds and actions. The month of Ramadan is a month of forgiveness which I have adhered to in this case. “I remain a committed member of the party to ensure that the objectives of the founding fathers of our great party are achieved for the betterment of our country and for democracy to strive. “Due to the intervention of well-meaning top party leaders and major stakeholders, I have requested my lawyer, Messrs. Rickey Tarfa and Co. to file the discontinuance of the case,” he said.
