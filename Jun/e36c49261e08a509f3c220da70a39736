The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in the FCT has called for the support of traditional rulers, community and religious leaders in sensitising residents on the dangers of drug abuse. The enforcement agency said the fight against illegal use of drugs will not be successful without the support of stakeholders and community leaders. Spokesman of the agency, Adegbe Peter, said the agency’s efforts towards ensuring a drug abuse free territory would be a success only when there was collaboration among key players. He said the command has not rested in its effort to curb the illicit activities of drug dealers, adding that its personnel have embarked on surveillance of various black spots across the territory and its environs. “But the command still needs the support of stakeholders, traditional rulers, community leaders and religious leaders to assist us in curbing the illegal use of drugs,” he said. He urged members of the public to always support the officials of the NDLEA to succeed in the fight against drug abuse.
