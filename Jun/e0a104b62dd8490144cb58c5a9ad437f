The Grassroots Mobilisation for Buhari/Osinbajo  has said it is mobilising support for the reelection of President Muhammadu Buhari in the six area councils of the FCT. National President of the group, Hajiya Fatima Mohammed Goni, stated this while addressing newsmen in Abuja on Saturday. She said the group was making arrangements to tour the six area councils of the FCT to meet with  the council chairmen and All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders and  galvanise support for the president’s re-election in 2019. She said the group would also appoint coordinators across the 36 states and the FCT to oversee its affairs. According to her, the large membership of the APC would enhance the fortunes of the party during the general elections. Goni also congratulated the chairman of Gwagwalada area council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, for defecting from APGA to APC.
