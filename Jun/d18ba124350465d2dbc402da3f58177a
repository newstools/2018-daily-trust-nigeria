Judges at the International Criminal Court have ordered the release from detention of the former vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jean-Pierre Bemba. His conviction on war crimes charges was overturned last week. Mr Bemba had been given an 18-year sentence in 2016. But judges ruled that he could not be held criminally responsible for crimes committed by his troops in the Central African Republic. Bemba will be handed over to neighbouring Belgium, where his wife and five children live. Judges in The Hague ordered him not to make public statements about a second case, in which he is accused of witness tampering. The Democratic Republic of Congo opposition leader was the highest ranking official among only four people who had successfully been prosecuted at the permanent war crimes court since it was set up in 2002.
