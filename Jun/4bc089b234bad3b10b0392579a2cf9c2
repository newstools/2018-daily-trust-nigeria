Senate President Bukola Saraki has urged media practitioners in the country to be objective in their reportage, especially during build up to the 2019 general elections. Speaking at a dinner as part of the IPI World Congress in Abuja, Saraki appealed to the media both national and international to maintain objectivity at all times. “I say this because there can be no democracy without credible elections. If we get the election right, then we have a better chance of making a stronger society. “We are living in times that call on the press to strive, more than ever, to defend freedoms. Events all over the world attest to the urgency of this. The media must be a defender of values; it must stand for rights, for openness - for the remaking of a world where the powerful will not oppress the weak,” he said.
