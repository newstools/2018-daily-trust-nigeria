Cristiano Ronaldo has ordered agent Jorge Mendes to sort out a transfer to Manchester United, according to reports in Spain.

The Portuguese sparked rumours regarding his future following the Champions League final win over Liverpool.

Ronaldo referred to Real Madrid in the past tense signalling that he could be on the move this summer.

And now Spanish outlet Don Balon say Julen Lopetegui being appointed as the new Los Blancos boss has not gone down well with him.

Ronaldo is said to believe Real are repeating the mistake they made when they hired Rafa Benitez a few years ago.
