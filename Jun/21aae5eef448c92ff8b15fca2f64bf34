At least 3750 people have been killed in different locations across the country in criminal conflicts since the beginning of this year. This finding, according to the Next Generation Youth Initiative International (NeGYII) President, Ambassador Johnson Onoja, was based on the activities of suspected herders, ethnic militia and insurgency. “Since the beginning of the year 2018, 3750 lives have been lost across Nigeria with the dominance in North Central to suspected herdsmen, ethic militia and insurgency in the North East of Nigeria. This act by every standard depicts barbarism, callousness and cruelty of the highest degree,” he said. Onoja, in a statement made available to Daily Trust in Makurdi, to commemorate this year’s National Day of Mourning, therefore urged the federal government to do everything within its powers to curtail further killings. He appealed to the government to do more by broadening its intervention approach as well as the security apparatus to ensure transparency and neutrality while holding the standard of best global practices in high regards in its operations. Onoja expressed the commitment of NeGYII and its partner, CLEEN Foundation, to ensure the safety and sanctity of human lives, democracy, good governance, youth empowerment, gender mainstreaming and environmental safety and sustainability in the country. “As we commemorate this year’s day of mourning in Nigeria, we convey with heavy hearts our heart-laden condolences to the families of the bereaved and the good people of Nigeria, especially the middle belt region where this evil is predominant. “We use this occasion to call for an end to further killings in Nigeria. We also make demand on the government to intensify its efforts to contain the current insecurity while we call on all citizens to be vigilant and security conscious at all times,” he said.
