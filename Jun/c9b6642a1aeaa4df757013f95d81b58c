Operatives of the Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC) at the weekend took their safety campaign to commercial motorcycle operators in Ojo area of Lagos State. The move is to educate commercial motorcycle operators also known as Okada riders of the danger inherent in riding dangerously on highways without wearing crash helmets. The safety campaign is to mark the United Nations World Bicycle day. The Unit Commander of Unit 2.112, Mr Obagbemiro Adeyemi, who led the team, said bicycle riding had been an age long mode of transportation adding that, the risk of riding bicycle in the past was not as high as it is today. He attributed the high risk to the volume of vehicles plying the highway. To mark this year’s celebration, the unit command in conjunction with the Lagos State Neigbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC), organized a cycling exercise with its theme: Bicycle for fitness. The exercise involved all staff of the command and LNSC cycling from the base of Rs 2.18 to the Lagos State University, where the Deputy Vice Chancellor addressed all the participants. Furthermore, the participants rode from LASU to OJO local government area where the local government’s Vice Chairman also took part where he pledged his support for the exercise. Afterwards, the participants were led to Inspiration Science Academy, Agbara where the staff and students were educated on the benefits of cycling and the need to own one.
