The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has expressed shock at the spate of killings unleashed on three local government areas of Plateau State by armed bandits. President of CAN, Dr Samson Olasupo Ayokunle, said yesterday that it was noteworthy that the affected communities were yet to come out with the exact figure of the death toll, but that it was alarming that over 86 lives, as confirmed by the police, have been lost, including defenceless women and children. He expressed sadness that despite assurances and promises by President Muhammadu Buhari that his government was committed to safety of lives and property, the latest coordinated and premeditated attacks on Plateau towns was unprecedented. “CAN is at a loss how scores of people can be killed without any form of resistance by soldiers deployed to contain the security challenge. How could dare devil criminals assault communities without resistance by security agencies to stop these killings. Of what relevance is the intelligence gathering by the Department of State Services (DSS) and other security agencies?,” Ayokunle said. CAN said the Federal Government needs to review its security machinery in a bid to make it effective.
