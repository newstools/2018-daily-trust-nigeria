Top seed Rafael Nadal will bid for a record-extending 11th French Open title after breezing past fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro in the semi-finals. Nadal, 32, won 6-4 6-1 6-2 to set up a meeting with Austrian seventh seed Dominic Thiem in today’s final. The Spaniard, who has only lost twice in 87 matches at Roland Garros, beat the Argentine in just over two hours. Nadal is only the second man after Roger Federer to reach 11 finals at the same Grand Slam. “I am very happy to be back in the final here at Roland Garros. For me it’s incredible,” said Nadal. Thiem, 24, will contest his first major final after beating unseeded Italian Marco Cecchinato in straights sets earlier on Friday.
