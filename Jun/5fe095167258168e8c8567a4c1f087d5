Two armed robbery suspects arrested in Lagos have confessed that they prefer robbing white men to Nigerian. They said their preference for white men was borne out of the volume of money they go around town with. The suspects were arrested by policemen attached to the Agboju Police station, Lagos. The suspects are said to be interrogation at the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS), Ikeja. One of the suspects simply identify as, Offon, said: "We target white men because their money is valuable when they are converted into naira. There is no money in the country; it is expatriates that have the money to spend. We used to go to banks to monitor their customers .We will follow our targets from banks to their homes and collect the money from them. We have a gun which I brought from Bayelsa state. I bought the gun N35,000. "Our first robbery operation was not successful as the white man we planned to attack didn't go home straight. He was driving round Lagos and we were following him but we couldn't pin him down. He will enter from one club to another until our fuel finished in our Okada. The Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who paraded the suspects, said he directed the DPO Agboju to go after the robbers and he succeeded in picking them up, adding they will be charged to court soon.
