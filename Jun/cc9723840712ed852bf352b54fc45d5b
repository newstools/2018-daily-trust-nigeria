Real Madrid have clinched the signing of Ukraine goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.

Lunin will join Real Madrid this summer from Zorya Luhansk.

The goalkeeper has kept 20 clean sheets in 51 matches over two seasons with the first team.

At 1.91 metres tall, the shotstopper is one of the most highly rated young players in Europe and will move to Spain for 14 million euros.

The 19 year old will join the team for pre-season and Julen Lopetegui will then decide where he fits into the pecking order at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.
