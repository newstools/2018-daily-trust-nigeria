Four hoodlums have stabbed one Hussaini Garba Mohammed while he was returning home from work on Wednesday night. The victim, who is the Head of editorial production of a newspaper in Abuja, said the hoodlums attacked him at Life Camp Junction after he alighted from a tricycle at about 11pm. “I was stabbed in the leg and hit with an object on my head before the hoodlums forcefully took my bag and ran away,” he said. He said he reported at the Life Camp Police Station that four ATM cards, a handset and International Youth Movement identity card as an ambassador for Youth Forum from Czech Republic were among items in the bag stolen by the hoodlums. The chairman of the motor park where he was attacked, Ahmadu Jika, told police at the scene of the event that some of his members witnessed the incident adding that the hoodlums were not his members. The Life Camp Divisional Police Officer, CSP Danlami Yusuf, has ordered offiers to comb the area and ensure the hoodlums were arrested.
