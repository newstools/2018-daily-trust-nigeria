The trial of Maryam Sanda, who was alleged to have killed her husband, Bilyaminu Bello, was yesterday stalled due to the ill-health of the prosecution counsel. At the resumed hearing yesterday, the prosecutor, CSP James Idachaba pleaded with the court to grant an adjournment on the grounds that he was not feeling well enough to proceed with the case. “My lord, I am completely down, I need urgent medical attention. I managed to come because of the seriousness of this case. Our witness for cross-examination is even in the court to show you how serious we are about this matter, I plead with the court to grant an adjournment,” he said. With his application for adjournment unopposed by all the defence counsels, the trial judge, Justice Yusuf Halilu granted the application and in view of the approaching judges’ annual vacation, the matter was adjourned to October 4 based on the consensus agreement of the counsels. Earlier, our reporter gathered that Maryam Sanda’s lead counsel, Joseph Daudu (SAN) had sent in words for the matter to be stood down for a while, as he was held up with other commitments. Upon Daudu’s arrival around 11am, Idachaba made his application for adjournment. Daily Trust reports that at the last sitting on May 15, the matter was adjourned to June 28 and 29 in view of a letter sent to the court by Maryam Sanda’s lawyer requesting for an adjournment due to ill health on his part.
