Rev Fr Patrick Alumuku (PhD) has been elected as president of the World Catholic Association for Communication, SIGNIS-Nigeria during the Second National Delegates’ Assembly. In his acceptance speech at the event which held recently, in Elele in the Catholic Diocese of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Alumuku committed to running an all-inclusive administration that will give all the provinces in the Catholic Church in the country, a sense of belonging.  The current Director of Social Communications for the Catholic Archdiocese of Abuja, said his leadership, would ensure that the social communication apostolate is strengthened at the provincial levels for them to promote the activities of the Catholic Church.  He said, “This would enhance active participation, empowerment and the development of the human personnel for them to deploy their professionalism to reporting activities of the Catholic Church within and outside the Church and the country.”  Alumuku who solicited the support of the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria for the positive promotion of the activities of the Church through the Social Communication Apostolate, also commended the outgoing and pioneer president of the association, Rev Fr (Prof) Walter Ihejirika and his executive for laying a solid foundation for SIGNIS-Nigeria between 2010 and 2018. He stated that he would build on the existing structures of the previous administration, in the spirit of continuity.  SIGNIS is the umbrella body in the Catholic Church that comprises the Directors of Religious and Diocesan Directors of Social Communications, the Catholic Media Practitioners Association of Nigeria (CAMPAN) Catholic Artistes and Entertainers Association of Nigeria (CAEAN) and the Association of Catholic Lecturers.
