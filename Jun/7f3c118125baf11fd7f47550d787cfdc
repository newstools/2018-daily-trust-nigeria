The Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi has said that President Muhammadu Buhari’s declaration of June 12 as the new democracy day as an act that will help Nigerians move on and forgive the atrocities committed by the leaders of the past and present. Speaking to Daily Trust on Wednesday over the phone, he also expressed that the apology made by President Buhari is a sign of a great leader. “If the country has wronged someone, we need to come out and say it and that’s what Buhari did. He displayed this by coming out to apologize and then did what he was supposed to do. When you apologize, it helps people move on and forgive the past.” “It’s about the unity of this country. I will always support a Nigerian. It’s not about where you’re from; it’s about being Nigerian. I’m a nationalist and I believe in one Nigeria,” he said. When asked on what he thinks Nigerians could learn from the actions of President Buhari, he shared that he has set an example for other leaders to follow. He specifically said he would be first to follow in his footsteps by apologizing to Nigerians and Africans alike on the actions of the past traditional rulers for selling their children to slavery all those years ago.
