A National Industrial Court in Abuja has fixed July 17 for hearing of a suit filed by former Acting Director General of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Ambassador Mohammed Dauda challenging his dismissal. Dauda in a suit instituted through his counsel, Kanu Agabi (SAN) also prayed for an order of the court reinstating him as a director and the Acting DG of the NIA. He joined the present DG of NIA and the NIA as defendants in the suit. He asked the court for a declaration that the procedure adopted by the defendants in the process leading to his dismissal falls short of the provisions of Articles 8(1) and (2) of the National Securities Agency Act, 1986 and it is therefore null and void. Dauda prayed the court for an order for the payment of his salaries and entitlements from the period of his “unlawful dismissal” to the point of his reinstatement. However, at the resumed hearing yesterday, when the case was mentioned, Dauda’s counsel told the court that the defendants just served on him their reply to the originating summons. He said defendants filed a preliminary objection challenging the suit and further prayed the court for permission to regularise their papers. The trial judge, Justice Olufunke Yemi Anuwee granted the defendant’s prayer seeking for regularization of their papers and adjourned the matter to July 17 for hearing.
