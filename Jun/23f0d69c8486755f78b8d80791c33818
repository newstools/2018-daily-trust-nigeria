Activities within Kaduna metropolis were at a standstill yesterday as thousands of members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) took to the streets to commemorate this year’s International Quds Day. They marched peacefully along the main city center on Ahmadu Bello Way, chanting slogans calling for the release of their leader, Sheikh Zakzaky and freedom of Palestine from Israel. Addressing protesters at the close of the event, the head of the Kaduna center of the IMN, Sheikh Aliyu Tirmizi, said the theme of his year’s protest was: ‘Free Sheikh Zakzaky’. The sheikh condemned the occupation of the Palestinian lands, including the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the continued murder of innocent people by Israelis. The cleric added that the movement would continue to seek redress through peaceful means.
