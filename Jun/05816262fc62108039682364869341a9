The Ona of Abaji and chairman of the FCT Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has advised the youth to acquire skills for self-reliance and not depend on white collar jobs. Yunusa made the call on Saturday when he received the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, ethnic chiefs, village and district heads as well as traditional title holders who paid him a Sallah homage at his palace. He said God had blessed the country with abundant resources and urged the youth to acquire skills so that they could benefit from the resources. He said the youth could be self-reliant if they devoted their time to learn vocations that could help in the development of the country. While urging the youth to shun all social vices, the Ona cautioned them against unguarded utterances and thuggery, especially ahead of next yearâ€™s election. Also speaking, the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, said his administration had made efforts to employ over 300 staff at both LEA and at the area council levels. He said the move was aimed at ensuring that the rate of unemployment, especially among graduates in the area was reduced to the barest minimum.
