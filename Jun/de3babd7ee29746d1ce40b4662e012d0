An IDP, Usman Yusuf, 70, was last Thursday killed in a stampede during the distribution of Ramadan Fast food items at El-Miskin IDP camp, Old Maiduguri, Jere Local Government Area of Borno State. Two others sustained serious injuries in a similar stampede for such items at Madinatu IDP camp in the local government area during a solar distribution exercise, the same day. The Executive Chairman of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Hajiya Yabawa Kolo, who disclosed this to newsmen in Maiduguri yesterday, blamed the philanthropic organisation, a federal government agency (name withheld), which distributed the food items in the two informal camps for the incidents. She alleged that most philanthropic organisations and individuals, including the organisation allegedly responsible for last Thursday’s incidents, lacked the required crowd-control experience to maintain safety and order during the exercise. “The agency (SEMA) is warning all philanthropic individuals and humanitarian organisations to strictly adhere to the international norms underpinning the protection of Internally Displaced Persons and also respect all the guiding principles that need to be observed while conducting distributions,” the Executive Chairman said. “SEMA is appealing to all intervening agencies and non-governmental organisations that lack capacity in crowd management and control to always seek the assistance of its trained and experienced volunteers while conducting distribution exercises,” Hajiya Kolo added. She also advised that philanthropic individuals and organisations to seek security escort from the nearest police station to the distribution locations.
