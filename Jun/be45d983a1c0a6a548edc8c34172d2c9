The  All Progressives Congress (APC) in Niger State yesterday swore in its 34 state officials, 25 local government party chairmen and zonal officials ahead of today’s national convention in  Abuja. The executives who were returned during the congresses last month are expected to pilot the party affairs for the next four years. The state chairman, Engr. Mohammed Jibrin Imam, urged the executives to justify the confidence reposed in them by ensuring that the party is returned at all elections in 2019. In an interview with newsmen shortly after the inauguration, Imam expressed confidence in the ability of the party to repeat its feat in the 2015 general elections. He said the party’s confidence stemmed from the outstanding performances at the federal and state levels by President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, adding that the party had been able to deliver on its campaign promises to return to power.
