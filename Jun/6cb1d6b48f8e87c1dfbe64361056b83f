The Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, yesterday described a statement credited to one of his high chiefs (now king) Oba Lekan Balogun as empty and deceitful. Oba Lekan Balogun had on Wednesday said contrary to the Olubadan’s directive, masquerade had visited his family house at Alli-iwo compound, describing Olubadan’s directive as misuse of power and arbitrary. In a press release issued by Olubadan through his Personal Assistant/Director of Media and Public Affairs, Mr Adeola Oloko, the Olubadan described the claim by Oba Lekan Balogun that he (Oba Balogun) hosted masquerade show in his compound as empty and deceitful. The Olubadan stated that the Egungun festival purportedly staged at a location somewhere in Alli Iwo (Oba Balogun compound) on Wednesday was far from the truth, and advised the listeners to beware of falsehood. He stated that when the masquerades came to pay homage in the Olubadan palace last Monday, there are photographs that could be verified in the papers and names of the masqueraders who were there.
