Senate President Bukola Saraki yesterday said the Senate under him was most productive since 1999 when the country returned to civil rule. Saraki in a statement to mark the third anniversary of the 8th Senate, issued from Saudi Arabia where he is on lesser hajj, said they have worked assiduously and diligently to meet demands of Nigerians. â€œIn this time, we have passed 213 Bills, cleared 138 petitions submitted by the public. We are happy to say that this Senate is the most productive since 1999. It has surpassed the 5th Senate which with 129 bills in four years had the highest number of bills, as against the 6th Senate with 72 bills, and 128 passed by the 7th Senate. The number of petitions we have successfully treated to the satisfaction of Nigerians, who filed them dwarfed the eight and six treated by the sixth and seventh Senate respectively. Saraki in a statement by his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyonu said the Senate and the National Assembly will continue to be transparent, accountable and responsive even as the nation and its political office holders prepare for the 2019 elections.
