An Abuja-based lawyer, Osikhena-Boih Donald said statements by suspects in the Offa armed robbery incident are not sufficient to prosecute Senate President Bukola Saraki. The Nigerian Police had asked Saraki to make explanations after arrested members of the armed robbery gang that killed 33 persons in Offa, Kwara State, fingered him and Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed as having provided them with vehicles and weapons. In his reaction, Donald said the allegations by the suspects does not qualify as circumstantial evidence, which could be used to indict or to ask the Senate President to appear in court to explain that they were merely coincidence. He said the allegation that the Senate President gave a vehicle to some people, which was later used for robbery was not graphic scenario to establish circumstantial evidence, adding that it has to be established that the vehicle made its way to and from Saraki’s house especially shortly before the robbery. “You must have sufficient evidence to sustain a charge. Could any atom of fact lead somebody to be charged? The answer is yes. But in doing that you must establish that whole and total. It is not a thing that in the course of trial you cannot go further with,” he said. He said questions that must be answered in relation to the confessional statements made by the gang members include whether Saraki sent them to go and kill; whether the money they took from the banks were shared with Saraki; whether they asked Saraki for arms before going for the operation; and whether after the robbery they asked Saraki for assistance to move the loot.
