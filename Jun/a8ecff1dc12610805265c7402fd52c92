The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says its victory in the just-concluded local government election in Rivers manifested the appreciation of the people over Gov. Nyesom Wike’s performance. The Party stated this in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Monday in Abuja. Ologbondiyan said that the outcome of the poll in which PDP won the 23 chairmanship seats confirmed Wike’s positive impact in the lives of the people. “Rivers State today is one huge construction site with visible projects that directly touch the lives of the people. “All that the electorate did at the local government election was just to reciprocate their governor’s achievements. “The outcome of this election therefore, is a confirmation that PDP is the dominant and preferred party of choice not only in Rivers State but the entire nation.” Ologbondiya said that the governors elected on the PDP platform were all delivering on the promises they made to the electorate. He added that while PDP governors were delivering on their campaign promises, many of their counterparts in the All Progressives Congress (APC) were either busy renewing their promises without projects to show for the years spent in office or making outright denials of such promises.

“The party congratulates the newly elected local government chairmen as well as the councillors and urge them to ensure that good governance is taken to the grassroots to fulfil the expectations of the voters,” Ologbondiya said.(NAN)
