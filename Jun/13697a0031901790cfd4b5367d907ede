Traders selling cloths, badges, caps, and shoes among others yesterday took over all the streets cordoned by security operatives deployed to provide cover at the Eagle Square. Dozens of food vendors also temporarily relocated their kitchen to Eagle Square where they provided delegates, supporters and other people easy access to food. Our correspondent who went round the four corridors to the Eagle Square saw traders displaying their wares amidst light shower. Food vendors mounted their tents besides the main roads while suya sellers and hawkers of sachet water, biscuits, fruits and other edibles were seen at middle of the road making a fortune. They all had a field day because all the major roads leading to the square had been blocked.
