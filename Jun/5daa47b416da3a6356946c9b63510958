Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso and Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose have called for credible and peaceful exercise during the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State. They spoke in Ado-Ekiti during a visit by Kwankwaso to Fayose at the Government House yesterday. A press statement by Fayoseâ€™s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Idowu Adelusi said Kwankwaso, who is currently in the Senate on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said elections should not be seen as war, but that the votes of the people must be made to count. Addressing the Northern community resident in the state, he urged them to live in peace with their hosts and exercise their civic duties during the election. Kwankwaso also decried the spate of killings in some parts of the country, noting that it was the responsibility of the government to secure the lives and properties of the citizens. Asked whether he would defect to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the former Kano State governor said whatever was collectively agreed upon by members of the New PDP would inform his next line of action. In his remarks, Governor Fayose thanked the senator for the visit adding that peace was imperative for the unity and corporate existence of the country. He lambasted the Federal Government for not being able to curtail the killings going on in the country.
