The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the FCT has said 246,000 Permanent Voters Cards (PVC), are yet to be collected by the owners. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), in charge of the FCT, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, who disclosed this on Wednesday, urged those that have registered to come forward and collect their PVCs to enable them exercise their franchise in next yearâ€™s general elections. He said many of the electorate in the territory had showed enthusiasm towards the forthcoming elections, adding that those who had just attained the age of 18 years and people coming for transfer should register. According to him, the 246,000 uncollected PVCs were from the 2011, 2014 and 2016 registration exercises.
