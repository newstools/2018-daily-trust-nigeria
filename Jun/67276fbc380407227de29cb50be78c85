Governor Abdullaziz Yari of Zamfara State has described as unfortunate, recent remarks by the Interior Minister, Lt-General Abdurrahaman Danbazau (rtd), that poor governance was responsible for the persistent insecurity in the state. The governor in a statement by his spokesman, Mal Ibrahim Dosara, said the minister’s comments berating Governor Yari were unfortunate. Danbazau had said at the International Press Institute (IPI) Annual Conference Lecture on Thursday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja that “It is not good governance for the governor of Zamfara State to say he is withdrawing as Chief Security Officer. Even if he is given all the soldiers in the world, he can’t use those forces to deal with those issues”. Yari, in his response wondered what the minister’s concept of good governance is and how a minister would expose himself and weaknesses by making such a public statement.
