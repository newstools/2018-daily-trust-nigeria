A free HIV counselling and testing for residents of Durumi, an urban slum in Abuja, a project funded by staff of the World Bank has opened with the month-long community connections campaign. The project, which is implemented by the Citizens Health Education and Development Initiative (CHEDI), is also providing awareness talks on immunisation, antenatal care and family planning, targeting women and young girls resident in the community. “So many women are not too sure about the importance of immunisation, nutrition and antenatal care. Until now, you still have traditional birth attendants here, and women give birth at home. It is only when they know the importance of giving birth in the right place, with the right personnel to have the right healthy child. It is very important,” said Chika Offor, of the Vaccine Network, at the flagoff of the project. “It is a very rural community.  They don’t have all these facilities you have in the urban areas. There are facilities they are supposed to have. The luxury of the city is not affecting them here,” said Adolphus Enyioha, executive director of CHEDI, justifying the choice of Durumi for the project. A leader of women in the community, Dorcas Barau, said residents had for long begged to have a health centre sited in Durumi. “Up till today, nothing. It is only private clinics. And when elections come, politicians will come to Durumi; we vote them and they do nothing. If you want to go to hospital, you must go into town,” she said.
