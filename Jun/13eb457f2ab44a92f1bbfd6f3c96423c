Chairman of the defunct National Electoral Commission (NEC), Professor Humphrey Nwosu, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for recognizing June 12 as Nigeria’s Democracy Day and for honouring the late Chief MKO Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993 Presidential Election. In a letter to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Gida Mustapha yesterday and dated June 10, 2018, Nwosu, who supervised the polls, which were later annulled by the then military junta, said the conferment of national honours on Chief Abiola and his running mate, Ambassador Babagana Kingibe will rekindle the national consciousness of all Nigerians for a better nation. The letter reads: “I thank His Excellency, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Government of Nigeria for recognizing June 12 as Democracy Day and also honouring the winner of June 12, 1993 presidential election, Chief M.K.O. Abiola. Indeed, June 12, 1993 marked a turning point in Nigeria’s tortuous journey towards a democratic polity. “It is an honour to the very hard-working men and women of the defunct National Electoral Commission under my leadership at this long awaited recognition. I humbly commend this action by the President. Undoubtedly, the democratic system of governance is the best especially for the multi ethnic nation like ours. I thank you for building on the foundation which my team and I laboured strenuously to establish and actualize on June 12, 1993.” Nwosu however said he won’t be attending the investiture ceremony “due to circumstances beyond my control I will, as I am outside the country.”
