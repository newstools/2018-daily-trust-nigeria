A house wife, Abimbola Obateru, on Wednesday approached a grade C customary court sitting in Oja-Oba, Mapo area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, for dissolution of her 8-year-old marriage with Dayo Obateru over interference of her mother in-law in her marriage. She said her mother in-law told her that she was too short to maintain her marriage with her son. She said: “My lord, I didn’t have any problem with my husband before his mother started instigating him against me. She told me that I am too short to maintain my marriage with her son. Immediately I heard that from her, I called my father so that he could talk to her and change her perception about me. My father visited her and explained to her that it is our family stature and appealed to her. Despite the intervention, the woman insisted that she hates me and told her son to leave me. Since that time, my husband has not been coming home again.  I was told that he is now based in Abuja”, she said. Obateru lamented the death of the only child in the marriage few weeks ago after she had filed the suit. “I have left his house since the last two years. Please kindly separate us my lord, there is no more love between us”, she appealed. The President of the court, Chief Odunade Ademola, who discouraged women intervention in their children marriages, dissolved the marriage.
