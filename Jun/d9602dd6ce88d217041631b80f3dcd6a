Twenty schools will be participating at the maiden children’s theatre festival in Abuja. The festival, organised by Playback Nigeria, with the support of  the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS), FCT chapter, will create an advocacy platform for the recognition and appreciation of talents in children. The Chief Executive Officer of Playback Nigeria, Oluwadamilola Apotieri-Abdulai, in a statement, described the move as an effort to render psychosocial support to thousands of children affected by the Boko Haram insurgency. Apotieri-Abdulai said the group was keen on developing and giving platforms for young people to use their creative skills as tools for advocacy, and bringing to the fore, issues children were faced with through theatre and drama. He said the first children’s theatre festival in Nigeria would help build children’s creativity and develop skills beside being a form of education. The event, scheduled to hold  from Wednesday 27, to Saturday 30, of June, 2018, at the National Centre for Women’s Development (NCWD), opposite CBN Headquarters, Abuja, will be the first of its kind in Nigeria. Among schools expected at the events are Top Hill School, Madonna Model School, British Oasis Academy and Stella Marris College. Playback Nigeria is an art-based organisation dedicated to using interactive arts for psychosocial support, community interaction, enhancement, development, education and capacity building.
