The Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) has urged residents in flood-prone areas to begin a plan to relocate to safer areas so as to avoid being overtaken by flood disaster. The Executive Secretary of SEMA, Mr. Ben Kure, gave the advice following several hours of heavy downpour in Kaduna yesterday. He said based on prediction by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agencies (NIHSA), areas prone to flooding in the state include Chikun, Igabi, Soba, Kaura, Kaduna North and Kaduna South LGAs. According to him, as a result of the over seven hours of down pour yesterday, water level reached the windows of some houses at Kamazou and Ungwan Maigero in Chikun LGA of the state. He however advised all those residing close to rivers, water ways and other flood prone areas to relocate to avoid any form of disaster. He disclosed that the agency had embarked on public sensitization campaign in flood prone-areas around Kigo Road, Nassarawa, Gonin Gora and Ungwar Romi in Kaduna among others.
