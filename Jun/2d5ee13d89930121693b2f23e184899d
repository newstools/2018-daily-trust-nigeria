An anti-corruption crusader, Bishop Osadolor Anthony Ochei, has said that he filed a suit against the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) at Federal High in Abuja over alleged shielding of former Edo State Governor, Adams Oshiomhole from investigation. Bishop Ochei had last week filed a suit at the Federal High Court asking it to compel the anti-graft agency to investigate his petition bothering on corrupt practices against Oshiomhole. Ochei stated this on Sunday in Benin while addressing journalists. He said he had in October 2016 petitioned the EFCC on the alleged corrupt practices perpetrated by former governor Oshiomhole during his tenure as governor of Edo. He said the agency acknowledged the petition in November 2016 but failed to act on it. “Based on the development, I went to Court to file an exparte motion to compel EFCC to do their job as enshrined in the EFCC Act 2004 because it is saddled with responsibility of receiving petitions on criminal matters bothering on economic and financial crime commission in Nigeria,” he said. While saying that his action was not political as he is not a member of any political party, Ochei said his action was to help President Muhammadu Buhari fight corruption holistically.
