The  Military is not responsible for the de-radicalization of repentant Boko  Haram, the Coordinator of Operation Safe Corridor, Major-General Shafar  Bamidele has said.

Speaking  during a panel discussion at the National Conversation on the  Humanitarian Development Peace Nexus, in Abuja, he said the Nigeria  Prisons Service was responsible for the de-radicalization job.

"The  Nigeria Prisons Service is in charge of the de-radicalization of the  repentant Boko Haram members", he said. "They sent in 130 experts to do  the job."

Major-General  Bamidele said the National Orientation Agency, National Emergency  Management Agency, National Directorate of Employment and the Nigeria  Immigration Service are also involved in the Operation Safe Corridor  program.

He  explained that the selection of Boko Haram members to be de-radicalized  is done by the Operation Lafia Dole who ensure that those admitted in  were not on the government's wanted list.

According  to him, 254 repentant insurgents are undergoing de-radicalization  currently while 150 will be added in the next two weeks.

He disclosed that 95 have already went through the programme and were now being integrated into the society.

He  called on the government to grant the repentant insurgents amnesty,  adding that this will allow them to easily reintegrate into the society.

Major-General Bamidele said that "we don't compromise discipline and anybody found guilty will be punished."
