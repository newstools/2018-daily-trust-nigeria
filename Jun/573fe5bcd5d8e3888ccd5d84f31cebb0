The Lagos State government yesterday declared June 12, 2018, as public holiday to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the annulled 1993 presidential elections believed to have been won by late Moshood Kashimawo Olawale (MKO)Abiola. Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, in a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government,  Mr. Tunji Bello, said the June 12, 1993 elections, adjudged as the freest and fairest in the history of Nigeria, would always be a reference point in the state’s quest to entrench true democracy in service to the people. It would be recalled that the state since the return of democratic government in 1999 has continuously declared the day a public holiday. The state government applauded the recent declaration of June 12 as the new Democracy Day by President Muhammadu Buhari, noting that the singular act has proved that “Chief MKO Abiola and other martyrs of democracy who laid down their lives in the struggle to entrench good governance did not do so vain”.
