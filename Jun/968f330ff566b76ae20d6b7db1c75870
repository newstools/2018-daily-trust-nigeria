Organized Labour has saluted what it called “the courage and sensitivity” of President Muhammadu Buhari for ensuring democratic consolidation by posthumously honouring Chief MKO Abiola, acclaimed winner of June 12 1993 Presidential election long demanded for by democratic forces for the past two decades. In a statement in Kaduna, Comrade Issa Aremu, NEC Member of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and General Secretary of the Textile Workers Union, said by the singular act of conferment of the highest national honour, Grand Commander of the Federal Republic (GCFR) on Chief MKO Abiola, President Buhari had commendably rekindled faith in sustainability of democracy in Africa’s largest democracy adding that the President “gave the correct signal that never again would any group of people violate the mandate of Nigerian people through mandate annulment” .
 
 
President Muhammadu Buhari Wednesday directed that henceforth Democracy Day will be marked every year on June 12, rather than May 29 which had been observed as Democracy Day since 1999 when the current democratic dispensation began. The shift is in honour of Late Chief MKO Abiola, the acclaimed winner of the June 12 Presidential election.
