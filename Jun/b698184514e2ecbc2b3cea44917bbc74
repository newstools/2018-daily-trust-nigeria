Leading presidential aspirant in the forthcoming National Youth Council of Nigeria election, Prince Chibuike Echem has praised the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Council, Dr. Dickson Akoh for his commitment to youth development in the country, stressing that the chieftaincy title of Oyachaba K'Idoma conferred on him by the Ochi Idioma IV, HRM Agabaigu Elias Obekpa is well-deserved. Prince Echem who disclosed this in a statement by his campaign organisation, noted that Dr. Akoh is a performer and a reformer who is after the welfare and well-being of Nigerian youths.   “Dr. Akoh has shown over the years that he is an achiever, a performer par excellence. This chieftaincy title conferred on him by the Ochi Idioma IV is well-deserved and a testament to the recognition of his good work,” he said. Prince Echem used the opportunity to call on Nigerian youths to choose ability, capacity and strong leadership qualities over religious beliefs, tribal differences and political affiliations during the election of the council slated for July 19. “One of the greatest human capital this nation has is her youths. The young people of this country are so gifted that all we look for are opportunities to showcase our potentials, skills, abilities, leadership and commitment to the Nigeria project. “If elected the National Youth Council of Nigeria President, our government shall restore hope to the overall Nigerian youths within and outside the country. We shall build bridges to restore the brotherhood of the youth sector in Nigeria. “One of our major targets shall be to restore the confidence and trust of every Nigerian youth in the leadership and activities of the council. “We shall engage the government at all levels and private sector on issues of interest to the Nigerian youth. We shall try by God’s grace to build a system of moral value, justice and fairness to the protection and defence of every Nigerian youth, home and abroad,” he added.
