A House of Representatives aspirant for Abuja South constituency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ahmad Abubakar Sadiq, on Saturday organised a skill acquisition training for women at Awawa village in Kwali Area Council. Sadiq, who spoke during the flag off of the training, said it was to help the women become self- reliant. He said 50 women, who included the APC local government and ward women leaders across the four area councils from Abuja South constituency, were enlisted to participate in soap making, tie and dye and baking. “If you are always close to people at the grassroots, there is no doubt you will understand their challenges. Lack of hand work among our women is one of them,” he said. He said the women would become self-reliant after learning the skills, adding that a token would be given to every one of them to enable them start their businesses. He therefore urged the participants to devote their time learning what they were being taught so that they could also impart it to others at their respective area councils.
