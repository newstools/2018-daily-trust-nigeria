The Christian Aid Nigeria, in conjunction with Gender Awareness Trust (GAT), has distributed starter packs worth over N6 million to 96 Kaduna girls to make them self-reliant. Daily Trust reports that 50 of them were selected from Kujama and Rido Hausa communities of Chikun local government while 46 others emerged from Zonzon, Ramai and Fadan Kamantan communities of Zango Kataf local government areas of Kaduna State. The benefiting girls had in the past two years on their own acquired skills in hair dressing, soap making, sewing, knitting and grinding before these NGOs came to support them with starter packs so they can move on. Expressing his happiness during the distribution of the starter packs to some of the beneficiaries in Mararraban Rido, Chikun local government yesterday, Wakilin Rido Hausa, Alhaji Jibrin Haruna described the intervention as a promise fulfilled. Earlier, Executive Director, GAT, Dr. Lydia Umar said the gesture under CAAGI project, was aimed at empowering adolescents and young women to rise above poverty. Project Coordinator, GAT, Tida Abbah Leo, was optimistic that, the empowerment would reduce the trend of idleness and promote sense of belonging among the women folk many of whom are not decision makers when it comes to economy related issues.
