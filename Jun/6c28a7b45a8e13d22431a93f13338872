A State High Court in Dutse, Jigawa State, yesterday discharged and acquitted the former governor Sule Lamido, who was standing trial since 2017 in a suite instituted against him by the Jigawa State government. The Jigawa State government sued Lamido before a Magistrate Court II in Dutse on charges of inciting disturbances, disturbance of public peace, criminal intimidation and defamation of character. The Defence Counsel, Barrister Yakubu Ruba, challenged the Magistrate Court on its jurisdiction to hear and determine the charges against his client on the ground that the action was not initiated in accordance to the provision of section 141 of the CPC Law of Jigawa State. The Magistrate Court, presided over by Usman Mohammed Lamin, over ruled the submission of the defence counsel, insisting that there was no violation of laid down procedure hence the trial continued. In the course of the trial, the defence counsel, filed an appeal before the state High Court based on his earlier submission and asked the magistrate court to adjourn the case sine dine. In their judgement, Justices Ahmed Musa Gumel, Umar Sadiq and Abdulhadi Suleman of the state High Court discharged and acquitted the former governor and set aside all charges against him as earlier prayed in his counselâ€™s submission.
