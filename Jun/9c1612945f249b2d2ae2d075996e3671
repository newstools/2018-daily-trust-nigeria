As part of efforts to usher in urban renewal in Asaba, the state capital, Governor Okowa commissioned two new roads, urging Deltans to partner with the government in the proper disposal of  waste to ensure a clean Delta. Speaking during the commissioning ceremony of Kanayo and Oboduku Streets, Akwuebulu, Asaba, Wednesday, Senator Okowa said his administration is determined to provide necessary infrastructure for rapid development. "Deltans should desist from indiscriminate dumping of refuse along the median of major roads and engage the Private Sector Partners (PSP) to evacuate their refuse. I call on waste management board and oshimili local government to work out how best to properly manage waste in the town and enlighten the people on how to properly dispose their waste to maintain a healthy environment," he said. While appealing to Deltans to engage the services of PSP and keep Asaba clean, Senator Okowa charged the waste management board and local government councils to partner and enlighten Deltans on proper waste disposal, stating that if we need to keep our towns and cities clean we must ensure effective waste management. "We know what our people expect from the government and my administration is accessable to Deltans that is why we are executing people oriented projects that are positively affacting the lives of the people, we are focused and will continue to pursue our vision of providing the dividends of democracy to the people."
