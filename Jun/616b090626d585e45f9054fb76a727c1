The migrant rescue ship Lifeline, carrying 230 migrants, has docked in Malta after five days stranded at sea.  The controversial vessel has been accused by Italy and France of ignoring international rules while carrying out its rescues. Malta has said it will detain the vessel while an investigation takes place. The rescued migrants, meanwhile, will be taken in by Malta, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal. Malta’s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said the country had no obligation under international law to assist the ship, but was doing so on humanitarian grounds.
