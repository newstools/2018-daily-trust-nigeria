Former governor of Kaduna State, Senator Ahmed Makarfi, has enjoined Nigerians to seize the opportunity provided by the Sallah season to intensify prayers for a speedy resolution of all problems facing Nigeria. Makarfi in a Sallah message to mark the Eid-el-Fit, said as Nigeria grapples with insecurity and other socio-economic challenges, the relatively well-to-do should look out for less privileged friends, brothers and sisters to share with them the joys of the moment. In a statement signed by his media aide, Mukhtar Zubairu Sirajo, the former governor called on Muslims not to lose sight of the lessons of Ramadan. “As we bid farewell to Ramadhan, the Senator enjoins all not to lose sight of the lessons inherent in the spiritual rejuvenation, sacrifice and self-deprivation that are some of the fundamental components of the fasting period. This way, we will continue to show empathy to the less privileged and generally be better brothers’ keepers. “It is also the earnest prayer of Senator Makarfi that all acts of worship collectively and individually rendered have been accepted by Allah (SWT), especially prayers for the prosperity and sustainable peace in Nigeria,” he stated.
