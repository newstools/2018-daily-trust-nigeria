A group of indigenes of Offa, led by a youth leader, Prince Femi Whyte, has accused some politicians in the state of jeopardizing police investigation into the armed robbery attack in the area that killed 33 people. The people, who carried placards during a peaceful protest round the ancient town, called on the police to ensure that all suspects and accomplices were prosecuted. Also speaking, spokesperson of the Association of Concerned Offa Indigenes, Chief Muideen Babalola, called on police authority to ensure that justice prevailed, no matter the level of personality involved in the matter. The protesters walked from Iyeru Okin African LGA primary school and ended their protest at Ijagbo junction near Yidi praying ground. They terminated the walk at the Olofa palace. At the Olofa palace, the protesters were addressed by one of the high chiefs, the Asalofa of Offa, Chief Isiaka Adebayo Shittu, who stood in for the Olofa of Offa, Oba Mufutau Gbadamosi, who was said to be in Saudi Arabia for lesser hajj. The high chief said their matter would be conveyed to the appropriate quarters. Meanwhile, the Olofa of Offa, Oba Mufutau Gbadamosi Esuwoye II, has also called for proper investigation into the matter, adding that Senate President Bukola Saraki has always regarded Offa as his second home. In a statement by his Principal Private Secretary, Dr Tajudeen Oloyede, Oba Esuwoye called on the police to be alive to their responsibility and avoid sensationalism in handling of investigation into the robbery incident.
