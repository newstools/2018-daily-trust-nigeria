 The plan to establish a national carrier must be carried on with cautious approach, aviation professionals cautioned.   The professionals under the aegis of Aviation Roundtable (ART), the industry think-tank group, wanted that an ideal national carrier "must be domestically registered with support and encouragement of the citizens through the objective actions of government irrespective of party affiliation."  Government had set up a task force committee comprising heads of aviation agencies to actualize the establishment of the national carrier by December 2018 amidst doubts from many stakeholders about the feasibility of the targeted date.   However, ART in a statement on Friday said it is not in sync with the committee made up of Government agency heads to midwife the process of setting up the proposed National Carrier.    "We as professionals in the industry are advising a cautious approach to this project", the ART said in the statement. According to it, the probability of the directed committeeâ€™s emotional influence on the finished product is not very encouraging.  It however urged the government to "carefully and transparently work out the involvement of operating local airlines that may be seriously considered."
