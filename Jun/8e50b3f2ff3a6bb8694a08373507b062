Women and youths protesting the attacks on villages in Barkin Ladi local government area of Plateau State yesterday stormed the government house and vandalised glass doors and vehicles within the premises. Daily Trust reports that the Christian Association of Nigeria, Plateau Northern zone had issued directives to all Christians to turn out for a massive protest to be led by mothers and supported by the youths. The protesters had converged at the Old Airport Junction in Jos wearing black and carrying green leaves as they walked to the Government House Little Rayfield. One of the protesters, Mrs. Nanbam John Dawan, had earlier told journalists that the protest was peaceful, adding that the aim was to register their grievance to both the state and federal government. Dawan said, “from the state government to the federal, they are doing nothing about the killings, we are tired of the killings, no place is safe in Plateau.” The protesters had tried to move into the old government house which is the official residence of the governor but they were barricaded by security agents. At the time, Governor Simon Bako Lalong was said to be at the Jos University Teaching to check up on injured victims of the attacks. The protesters then moved to the new government house, Little Rayfield and forced their way through the gate where they smashed the glass doors of the government house administrative block and some vehicles including those of journalists. Attempt by the governor’s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Samuel Emmanuel Nanle, to appease them failed which led security agents to shot in the air to disperse them.  Nanle told journalists that it was unfortunate that what started as a peaceful protest had been hijacked by miscreant youths.
