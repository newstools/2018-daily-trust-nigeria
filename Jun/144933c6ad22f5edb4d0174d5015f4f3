Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has said on a visit to Sicily that the island must stop being “the refugee camp of Europe”. The leader of the far-right League party said his government’s plans on migrants were not “hard line... but common sense”. He said that increasing deportations and limiting new arrivals would end up saving lives. However, critics have cast doubt on the feasibility of Mr Salvini’s plans. Italy is the main destination for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe, although numbers have fallen in recent months. The country’s new populist government involving the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League was sworn in last week, ending months of uncertainty for the EU’s fourth-biggest economy. The League is strongly anti-immigration and a joint plan agreed with the M5S in forming the new government reflects that stance. Speaking on Sunday in the Sicilian port of Catania, Mr Salvini said: “Enough of Sicily being the refugee camp of Europe. I will not stand by and do nothing while there are landings after landings. We need deportation centres.”
