Chief Missioner of Nashirullahi Fathi Society of Nigeria (NASFAT), Alhaji Abdul-Azeez Onike yesterday charged the Federal Government to dig deep into the root cause of insurgency in any form in the country. He said no form of killing whether by Boko Haram insurgents or suspected herdsmen has religious undertone. Speaking at the Lailatul Qadr prayer organized by the society to mark the end of the 2018 Ramadan fast, Onike also called on Nigerians irrespective of religion to embrace peace and pray for peace to reign in all parts of the country. As the month of Ramadan winds down, he called on the Muslim faithful to carry on with the good deeds exhibited during the period and be advocates of peaceful and harmonious coexistence.  “This is an opportunity for everybody to key into the teachings of the fasting regardless of your religion, pray for the president and pray for the country,” he said.  On the insecurity in some parts of the country, he said, “Government should develop the goodwill, go further and do research on what is causing insurgency and nip it in the bud”.  He commended the present administration for the reduction in insurgency in the country.  President of NASFAT Worldwide, Engr. Kameel Bolarinwa, said NASFAT as a purely a religious organization that is non-partisan politically is concerned with entrenching religious harmony and peace in the country.  “We need peace in the country to achieve our stated objectives. That is why I believe as Nigerians, we have a civic duty to choose those we want to preside over the affairs of our states and country by voting in the forthcoming elections,” he said.  NASFAT National Women Affairs Secretary, Alhaja Samiat Mumineen urged Muslim women to be patient and steadfast, saying, “There is no need to run helter and scepter for help anywhere. If you are steadfast in your religion, you will overcome all trials. Allah has promised to test our faith and he will grant us ease after hardship”.
