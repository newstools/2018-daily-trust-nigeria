The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has advised Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha to desist from further ‘libellous’ attacks on the party leaders. The APC in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Malam Bolaji Abdullahi, said Okorocha had made libellous attacks a daily occurrence in recent weeks. “The sensible thing to do when you find yourself in a ditch is to stop digging. We, therefore, once again urge Governor Okorocha to tread the path of caution and reconciliation and to work with the duly elected party executives in the state for the good of the Party. We shall however not tolerate his constant assault on the party, either directly or through proxies,” the statement further read. “Hardly a day passes by without Governor Okorocha verbally assaulting our National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun and other party leaders over the recently concluded congresses in Imo State,” the statement said. The statement pointed out that a number of false claims were made against the party in an advertorial published in the Daily Trust Newspaper of June 11, 2018 and titled in part: “Let The Truth Speak For Itself” which was allegedly signed by a known associate of Governor Okorocha, Ireagwu Obioma, as ‘Acting Secretary, Imo APC’. It stated that the import of the allegations was that the party was aware of a court order preventing it from conducting the Imo State Congress, following receipt of a copy of the so-called court injunction which directed it to maintain status quo. Part of the statement read, “But nothing can be further from the truth. Even the published documents in the advertorial do not support this position and in fact gave a lie to the governor’s version of events, that the party was duly served and prevented from going ahead with the Congress in Imo State.
