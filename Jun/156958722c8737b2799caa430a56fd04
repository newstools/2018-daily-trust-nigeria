The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Abuja North Stake, has celebrated the creation of its 100th stake in West Africa. It was a time of jubilation and thanksgiving to the Almighty God for the members of the church on Sunday when the congregation gathered to celebrate the milestone. The president of the stake, Eric Mbibi, expressed gratitude to God for the great expansion which he described as a major milestone in the history of the church since its establishment in 1978. Mbibi urged the members to live in peace and harmony with others by imbibing the biblical virtues of love irrespective of their faith and ethnic nationality. “It’s a thing of joy for me to witness this historical event. It is indeed a major milestone since the creation of the church. Today, the church is celebrating the creation of its 100th stakes for the first time. “The celebration also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the June 8, 1978 revelation on the priesthood when the church officially began in West Africa. This is an indication that the church of Christ is growing and will keep on growing,” he said. Recounting the challenges of the church, its pioneer, John Ahuama, said its expansion taught a great lesson in persistence and perseverance. He said the church started in a very small room but later expanded as a result of the selfless service of its pioneering members who worked to record its present success.
