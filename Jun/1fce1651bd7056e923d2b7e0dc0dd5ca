Seventeen suspects were yesterday paraded over the killings in some villages of Gashish in Barkin Ladi local government area and the attack on travellers along Heipang, Mararaban Foron and Anguldi in Jos south, Plateau State. Ahmed and Yahuza were arrested around Gashish district in Barkin Ladi, while Friday was arrested in Belshow also in Barkin Ladi, according to the Special Task Force of Operation Safe Haven, set up to maintain peace in Plateau State. The Media and Information Officer of the taskforce, Major Adam Umar, said Ahmed and Yahuza were arrested on Saturday afternoon while Friday was arrested on Sunday, adding that the four weapons paraded with the suspects included three locally-made and one automatic AK47. “Whenever such things happen and the moment they notice our men are on their trail, they usually abandon their weapons which were picked by security agents,” he said. The taskforce also paraded 14 youths in connection with the civil disturbances on Sunday afternoon which led to attacks on travellers along Mararaban Jama’a, Mararaban Foron and Anguldi. Major Umar said all the suspects were cooperating with security agencies, adding that their arrest would lead to the arrest of other accomplices.
