The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State,  Donatus Nwankpa, has extended an olive branch to the faction of the party in the state, calling on them to close ranks with the newly sworn in executive to ensure a united front. Addressing party members after the executive members took the oath of office at the party’s secretariat in Umuahia, Nwankpa said he is extending a hand of fellowship to all aggrieved members “so that the dream of taking over the state in 2019 would be realized. “Let us come together to build a party that will take over the Government House in 2019. If I have in the course of pursuing my ambition stepped on your toes, I apologise”.
