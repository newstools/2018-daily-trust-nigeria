The Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit (PICA) has said that over 1, 918 tips had so been submitted by whistle-blowers since the launch of the whistleblowing policy in 2016. An official of PICA Unit at the Federal Ministry of Finance, Mohammed Isa, disclosed this yesterday in Abuja in a keynote address at a workshop organised by the African Centre for Media and Information Literacy (AFRICMIL). Isa said 682 cases were under investigation, while 40 persons had so far been convicted. The Coordinator of AFRICMIL, Chido Onumah, said the workshop was one of the activities lined up by AFRICMIL through its anti-corruption project tagged ‘Corruption Anonymous’ which aims at sensitizing citizens on the whistleblowing policy and the need to join in the fight against corruption. The project supported by the MacArthur Foundation, seeks to promote and mobilise support for the whistleblower policy by creating awareness for the policy, preserving the integrity of the process and advocating for the protection of whistleblowers.
