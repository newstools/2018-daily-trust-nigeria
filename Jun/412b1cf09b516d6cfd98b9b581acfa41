The Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF), Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita, has inaugurated a technical committee to develop a wholesome Welfare Policy for Federal Civil Service.  Oyo-Ita said that the inauguration was part of implementing the 2017 to 2020 Federal Civil Service Strategy and Implementation plan.  This is as she said that workers should look broader beyond salary increment only as welfare of workers goes beyond salary, psychological frame of mind, aspiration as human being, post retirement welfare, environment and health among others.  She said that one of the major priority areas in the implementation plan was the improvement of welfare benefit packages for civil servants.  “The policy is expected to provide a framework that would ensure that all issues of welfare of federal government employees are fully developed and institutionalized. The policy will ensure that MDAs are committed to providing a caring and supportive work environment that is conducive for the welfare of all employees which enables them to develop to their full potential,” Oyo-Ita said.  She urged the members of the committee to work hard and ensure they complete their assignment in three months.  The chairman of the committee and Permanent Secretary, Service Welfare Office (SWO), Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (OHoCSF), Mrs Didi Walson-Jack, said that the committee would ensure delivery of their mandate and complete their assignment on time.  While assuring that they would work assiduously to submit their report in September, she said that the re-establishment of the service welfare office had in August 2017 made efforts to establish a framework that would guarantee welfare of Civil servants.
