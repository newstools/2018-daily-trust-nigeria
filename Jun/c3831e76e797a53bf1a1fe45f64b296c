The Founder, Rose of Sharon Foundation, Mrs Folorunsho Alakija  has revealed that a total of 3,000 widows have so far been empowered with different types of vocational skills in the last 10 years of the foundation’s existence. Speaking in Lagos on Wednesday to mark the 10 year anniversary of the Foundation, Alakija the numbers of lives so far touched by the foundation are inspirational for more philanthropical gestures and not a destination. According to Alakija, the Foundation has since 2008 focused on alleviating the plights of the vulnerable groups of people by providing them with financial independence and educational support to tertiary level or vocational training as the need arises. “A journey that started with three widows on May 23, 2008, has empowered over 3,000 widows through vocational skills acquisition and awarded scholarships to 1,366 widow’s children and 86 orphans. The loans to widows are interest free and the scholarships have no conditions attached. We have also provided accommodation for residential and business purposes for 82 widows. “And in conjunction with our partners, we have provided free healthcare check-ups and free legal services to our widows and orphans at various times. Our successes are wrapped around the different empowerment programmes that include enterprise development and skill acquisition, Rose of Sharon Micro Credit Scheme, Rose of Sharon Scholarship scheme, Youth Empowerment programme (YEP), Rose of Sharon Welfare Scheme (RoWS), among others,” Alakija said. To mark the Foundation’s 10th anniversary, the Founder said a charity walk has been slated for Saturday June 16 while the commemoration of the International Widows Day on June 23 will mark the climax the decade-long anniversary.  She added that 100 widows out of a total of 350 are expected to join the Foundation before the end of the year, would be formally empowered on international day for widows.
