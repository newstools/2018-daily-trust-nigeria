The Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole has advocated for the inclusion of TB test result in the requirements for employment in the federal and state civil service as well as admissions into secondary and tertiary institutions. He said this is with a view to fast tracking diagnosis and total eradication of the disease from the country before 2030. He made the suggestion yesterday in a keynote address at opening ceremonies of the 61st National Council on Health Meeting currently going on in Kano with a theme “the second national strategic health development plan: a roadmap to achieving health coverage. “In addition, mandatory TB screening should be part of pre-employment medical tests for the newly employed staff in all Ministries, Departments & Agencies at all levels (federal, state and LGs) and the newly admitted students into secondary and all tertiary institutions in the country” he said. The minister further directed the health workers at the Outpatient Departments of secondary and tertiary health facilities across the country to conduct symptomatic TB screening on all care seekers on visit, irrespective of whether they have signs for the disease or not.
