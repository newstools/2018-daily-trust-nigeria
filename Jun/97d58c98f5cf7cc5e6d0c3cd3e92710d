The FCT sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Wobin A. Gora, has advised parents to always fasten their children’s seatbelts while driving them to school. Gora made the call yesterday during the 2018 Children’s Day safety education organised by Unit 24 of the FRSC Special Marshal of the FCT. He also cautioned parents against using the phone while driving, advising that they should always park by the roadside to make or receive phone calls. He stressed the need for motorists in the territory to learn to respect zebra crossings, saying the crossings were marked places where children crossed the road. “Anybody that does not respect zebra crossing  would be punished  when arrested by men of the FRSC,” he warned. The sector commander assured that the FRSC would not hesitate in sending such erring motorist to hospital for psychiatric and emotional tests. Also speaking, the FCT sector commander of the FRSC Special Marshal, Mr. Adaji Usman, said the programme was organised to catch school children young. He said there were a lot of motorists in the country that had exhibited recklessness while driving, which was why it become necessary for the corps special marshal to organize  the programme to sensitize children on the dangers associated with road crashes. “So we are teaching these children the way to go about safety on our roads. As they are growing up, they will grow with it,” he said. Pupils from various primary and secondary schools in the FCT participated in a drama presentation at the event.
