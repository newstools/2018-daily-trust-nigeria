The National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) has expressed worry over the 1:30 ratio of nurse to patients in most of the health facilities in the FCT. NANNM’s chairperson, FCT chapter, Comrade Deborah Yusufu,  said the shortage of manpower was caused by attrition, retirements, migration and deaths of nurses. Yusufu was speaking at the 2018 FCT Nurses Week/Scientific Workshop in Abuja themed, ‘The Role of the Nigeria Nurse in the Provision of Effective Healthcare Delivery’. She therefore appealed to the appropriate authorities to address the issue as it was affecting effective healthcare delivery as well as causing burnout and other stress-induced illnesses for health workers. “I urge the management to provide sponsorship opportunities, in long and short time training, in order to maintain high standard or nursing care in line with international best practices. “Availability and maintenance of equipment and a working environment that is conducive will go a long way in rendering quality health care services in the country,” she said. While calling for proper placement of NANNM members as provided in the Nurses’ Scheme of Service, Yusufu also urged nurses to be diligent in carrying out their duties. The national president of NANNM, Comrade Abdrafiu Adeniji, said in spite of the important role of nurses in providing healthcare services, they were being relegated in the formulation of healthcare policies and planning. President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Dr Ayuba Wabba, commended  nurses for remaining resolute in providing healthcare services despite challenges. He said nurses are the backbone of medical services, such that any policy that will not accommodate their contribution is a process that will not lead to success. He, therefore, urged government to address the salary gap in the health sector. “If health is a team, there is no way two salaries can be increased to one cadre and all other cadres will now be in jeopardy,” Wabba said.
