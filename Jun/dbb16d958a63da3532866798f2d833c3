President Muhammmadu Buhari has described Nigerians as intellectually aggressive and economically ambitious. According to him, Nigeria’s selling point remains a populace that always seeks self-improvement and self-actualization in any part of the world. He was speaking yesterday in an audience with the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Morocco, Saadeddine Othmani, at the Royal Guest Palace, Rabat, Morocco. Buhari, who was on a two-day working visit to Morocco, said: “Nigeria’s visionary and resilient population’’ works hard to always position the country for more growth, fuelled by a largely youthful group that continually wants to contribute to development. “Nigerians are intellectually aggressive and economically ambitious. I received some of our students here yesterday and I am really impressed with the zeal and fearlessness they exuded. “In Nigeria, we have a very young and aggressive population and we are working very hard to create the enabling and inclusive environment for their contributions to be better appreciated.” Buhari, according to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, said his administration was harnessing the human and material resources available in Nigeria, especially in the educational and agricultural sectors. The Prime Minister said his country had always been impressed by Nigeria’s intellectual zeal and strength, noting that “many Moroccans appreciate the intellectual contribution of Nigerians, especially in literary works.’’
