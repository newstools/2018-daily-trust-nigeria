The leader of Ibadan masquerades and the Aare Alagbaa of Ibadanland, Chief Ojetunde Asoleke on Monday assured the Olubadan of Ibadanland,  Oba Saliu Adetunji that the masquerades would abide by the directive of Olubadan on the new kings. Oba Saliu Adetunji had barred the masquerades from visiting any of the high chiefs (new kings)  whose elevation to kingship status generated controversies and court actions. Speaking during the visits of the masquerades to the monarch palace, Asoleke said they would abide by whatever the king directed. He said, “Whatever the Olubadan said is what we are solidly behind. Olubadan gave us the order that we should not go to any of the High Chiefs to dance and we are not going there because Olubadan is the head of all traditional worshippers in Ibadanland, be it Egungun, Sango, Oya, Obatala, Osun or whatever. And being the head, he has the right to tell us what is proper to do, and whoever that does otherwise will be punished by the Olubadan himself.” However in a counter move, the concerned high chiefs-turned beaded kings kicked against the Olubadan’s instruction, describing it as arbitrary use of power and an attempt to fight tradition. In a statement signed by the Otun Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Lekan Balogun, on behalf of others after their meeting on Monday, the kings insisted that they would resist the order and host masquerades in their various homes. They also described security reason given by the monarch as phantom.
