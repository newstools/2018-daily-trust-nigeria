At least 16 Fulani herders have been killed in suspected ethnic clashes in central Mali, the government and local sources said on Sunday. Saturday’s attack involved an attack on the village of Koumaga in the Mopti region, the government said. “I confirm there were clashes between people from the same village (Koumaga), in the circle of Djenné (near Mopti). The army intervened to intervened and counted 16 dead for the moment,” security spokesman Amadou Sangho told Reuters. The government did not provide further details of the attack, but an organization representing Fulani herders said on Sunday that close to 50 people were killed in Koumaga by Donzo hunters as part of ongoing clashes between the two groups that have long fought over land, grazing grounds and water rights. “Shepherds, very young children with their animals in the bush, people returning ... to cultivate their fields, were cowardly murdered,” said Abdoul Aziz Diallo, who runs Tabital Pulaaku, a Fulani association.
