Security agents are searching for five travellers believed to be Fulani after their vehicle was attacked and burnt Thursday night around Heipang in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State. The five were said to be returning from Kara cattle market in Jos South when they were ambushed by a group around 7pm. The vehicle which was also conveying a cow was set ablaze. The cow was severely burnt while the occupants were not found when men of the Operation Safe Haven security outfit arrived the scene. The Secretary, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in Barkin Ladi, Abubakar Gambo, said the five occupants were suspected to have been killed as their phone numbers were not connecting. Police spokesman, ASP Tyopev Terna, said security agents recorded the crime as arson and kidnapping, adding, “We are searching for the five victims because we have not seen any corpse.” Operation Safe Haven Media and Information Officer, Major Adam Umar, said the ambush  occurred around Heipang railway roundabout and that the attackers fled when the taskforce arrived the scene.  He said the vehicle and the cow were at the Heipang police station.
