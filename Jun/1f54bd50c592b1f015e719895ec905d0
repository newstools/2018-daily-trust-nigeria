A former Senator representing the FCT, Chief Daniel Yakwo, has raised alarm that suspected kidnappers who abducted and later released him are still threatening his life. City News had reported that the Sen. Yakwo was abducted three weeks ago by armed bandits at his farm near Chikara village in Abaji on the Abuja-Lokoja Road. Sen. Yakwo, who  spoke to our reporter on telephone yesterday, said the kidnappers had been using one of the phones they took from him  to call and threaten to kill him if he refused to give them ransom. He said he had reported to the police at Abaji and Chikara police stations about the threats. “In fact, can you imagine, even when I was at the police station, the kidnapers still phoned and threatened to come to my house in Abaji to kill me if I didn’t give them the ransom they demanded from me,” he said. Yakwo said he was forced to relocate to Abuja since the threats were becoming frequent. He also said he had blocked the 9Mobile line they were using to threaten him. When contacted, the Abaji Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Tersoo Tile, confirmed to our reporter that the Sen. Yakwo came to the police station to report the threats. “But we don’t want to make it public as we are making effort to track them because they are within, and we will definitely get them,” the DPO said on telephone.
