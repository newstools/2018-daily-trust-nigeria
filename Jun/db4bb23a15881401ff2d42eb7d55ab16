The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to revisit the plight of the 54 soldiers imprisoned for refusing to fight Boko Haram insurgents with poor weapons. MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, said yesterday in a statement that the call was imperative as “Ramadan is the month of mercy, its beginning a blessing, its middle is for forgiveness while its end is freedom.” He noted that the 54 soldiers were sentenced to life in prison before their sentences were commuted to 10 years imprisonment. “MURIC sees the 54 soldiers as whistle-blowers, not criminals because they actually exposed the $2.1 billion arms fraud. It is a sad paradox that while other whistle-blowers are being rewarded, the 54 soldiers are languishing in jail. In the spirit of the forgiveness and freedom which the middle and end of Ramadan stand for, we appeal to Mr. President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to, in exercise of the prerogative of mercy, grant presidential pardon to the 54 soldiers. “We call on civil society, particularly anti-corruption crusaders to speak out for the 54 soldiers. We also remind state governors and state chief judges to use the occasion to visit prisons in their states with a view to setting free a large number of inmates particularly those awaiting trial,” Akintola said.
