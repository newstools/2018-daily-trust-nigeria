The police in Lagos have arrested a middle age woman,  Linda Mabi, for allegedly  swindling a man, Mr. Damilare Muritala, of the sum of N10 million. It was gathered that the suspect allegedly collected the sum from the victim under the pretense of selling a house. The suspect had allegedly told the victim that the house she intended to sell is located at County Home, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos. A police source said that the lady had convinced the man that she intended to sell the house because she wanted to relocate abroad. The police said the woman bolted away after collecting the money. The victim was said to have reported the matter to the police after months of trying to track her down. A source said that the woman was eventually tracked down to her hideout from where she was arrested. It was gathered that during interrogation, the suspect admitted collecting the money and promised to refund it as she was no longer selling the house. It was gathered that based on the agreement, the suspect issued two bank cheques with serial number, 77148223 and 77148224 of UBA PLC. However, the bubble busted when the victim went to the bank to withdraw money, but was declined as the bank officials explained that the woman in question had no such amount of money in her account. She was arrested and charged before the Ikeja Magistrates Court for obtaining money under the false pretense and stealing. She pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Mr. Promise Olatunji did not oppose the bail application by her counsel. Thus, the presiding magistrate, Mrs. Y.O Aje-Afunwa granted the suspect bail in the sum of N2 million with two sureties. She was remanded in prison custody pending when she will perfect her bail condition. The matter was adjourned till  July 9, 2018.
