The FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has decried the rising cases of drug abuse among married women and young ladies in the FCT and the nation at large. The minister made the remark at a one-day sensitisation workshop with theme, ‘Women and Substance Abuse and its Implication on the Society’ organised by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) FCT Command in collaboration with the FCTA. He expressed concern at the rate of abuse of drug substances by women, adding that it posed negative consequences on the development of the nation. “The workshop is apt coming at a time when there is need to curb the menace of drug abuse, especially among women. Women represent 50% of the nation’s population and play critical role in the economy and development of the nation. So, it is paramount that we curb this scourge,” he said. Bello appealed to the participants, drawn from six area councils of the FCT to take the message to their various communities and sensitise the people on the health implications of drug abuse. The NDLEA, FCT Commander, Mrs Chinyere Obijuru, described the reoccurring cases of drug abuse among women as worrisome, saying it could jeopardise the future generation, if nothing was done to curb the ugly trend. She, therefore, reaffirmed the commitment of the command to build a drug abuse free generation of future mothers through continuous enlightenment on the health implications of drug abuse.
