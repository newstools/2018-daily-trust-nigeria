President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said the death of Sarkin Fadan Kano, Alhaji Sule Gaya, a  parliamentarian and minister of works in the First Republic, had robbed Nigeria of one of her humblest and most dedicated parliamentarians. Gaya died Thursday at his residence in Durumin Iya Quarters at Kano Municipal Local Government Area at the age of 102 after a protracted illness. Buhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity Malam Garba, said one of the greatest legacies a man or woman could leave behind was an unblemished integrity. The president affirmed that the late Sarkin Fada of Kano was a remarkable man in his own right. The president described the late Sarkin Fadan Kano as a pride to his family and state, saying he did not only live to the ripe age, but also lived an exemplary life of integrity and dedicated public service record.  He noted that as a member of the defunct Northern House of Assembly and a regional Minister of Local Government in the Second Republic, Gaya belonged to the golden age of decent and respectable democratic representation.  The president prayed Allah bless and forgive the gentle soul of the deceased. The Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday led the funeral prayer for Gaya, who was elected member of the Northern Regional Parliament in 1956 and became the parliamentary secretary in 1957. He was later appointed Councilor in charge of education at Kano Native Authority. He is survived by three wives, many children and grandchildren.
