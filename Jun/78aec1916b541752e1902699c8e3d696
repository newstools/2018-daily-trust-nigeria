Senate President Bukola Saraki, has called on security agencies to fish-out those responsible for the killings in Plateau State to help bring an end to the situation. He made the call yesterday during a condolence visit to Plateau State, over this weekend’s killings, saying those responsible for the act must be brought to book. Saraki had earlier yesterday met with President Muhammadu Buhari, alongside Speaker Yakubu Dogara. He was received in Jos by the Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong, at the State Government House. “You cannot bring back the lives, but finding and prosecuting the perpetrators will go a long way in helping to calm people and ease the pain that they are going through. “Therefore, yet again, we call on our security agents to ensure that they find the perpetrators that have done this and make them account for their detestable actions,” Saraki said. Lalong commended Saraki for the visit saying, “As the leader of the North Central, we welcome you to our state. When this thing started, as the leader of our geopolitical region, you looked for me and you called me, despite your busy schedule to ask me “What can I do to help?” “On behalf of the good people of Plateau State, I thank you and the Senate delegation for being here. This is because you are not only here representing yourselves; you are here representing the entire National Assembly.”
