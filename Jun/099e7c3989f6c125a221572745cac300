The Ona of Abaji and chairman of the FCT Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has said some marriages fail because women are not good at cooking and home management. Yunusa, was speaking at the JIBWIS Central Mosque when he joined residents for the Ramadan tafsir in the area yesterday. He said lack of proper handling of the home front by some married women sometimes led to divorce. He said some parents have also failed in training their daughters properly. “Honestly, I feel ashamed that some of our women don’t even know how to cook and take care of the home front, this has led to reported cases of divorce. And the parents should be the ones to blame because they failed to spare their time to give their daughters proper training,” he said. He also expressed displeasure over the misuse of the hijab by some women, saying it was unfortunate that some women wore the hijab to perpetrate crime. He also expressed concern over dating for several years without marriage, which he attributed to expensive lifestyle of women. “Sometimes when I ask ‘why have you not married’, the response always upsets me and I want to call on parents to sit down with their daughters on how to make marriage easy for both spouses,” he said. The traditional ruler called on parents to always ensure they send their children to acquire both Islamic and western education, saying no society would develop without education. He also urged them to be security conscious and watch the movement of their children, saying the council has witnessed five kidnap cases of recent. He further urged them to pray for the government to overcome security challenges in the country. He was accompanied by the Chief Imam of Abaji Central Mosque, Alhaji Usman Bala, and some members of his traditional council. They also visited some mosques holding Ramadan tafsir.
