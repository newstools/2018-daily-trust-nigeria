The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) yesterday charged security chiefs in the country to rise up to their responsibility and address the killings across the country or the forum would be left with no option than to call for their replacement. The forum’s chairman, Governor AbdulazizYari of Zamfara State while on a condolence visit to Governor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State over the recent killings in Barkin Ladi LGA, described as unfortunate, the inability of security agents to promptly intervene at the venue of most attacks until after the killings, adding that, “We must do something as leaders, else the next target would be us because people may turn against us. We will interface with the security chiefs to make them understand our plight and sit up or we will have no option but to ask the president to drop them.” Accompanied by the governors of Delta, Imo, Sokoto, Nassarawa, Benue and Bauchi states as well as the deputy governors of Akwa Ibom, Edo, Oyo and Ondo and Kaduna states, he disclosed that the last NGF meeting centered on insecurity across the country, adding that, between March and June, there were 115 incidents and 435 people lost their lives in his state. “Our people are suffering. Within two hours, 235 people were killed, 80 found in one place. In Plateau State since 2012, this is the worst. These people must be brought to book because people have taken things for granted for too long. This must change.” The forum also donated an undisclosed amount of money to assist internally displaced persons in the state, and encouraged the governor to continue in his effort to restore peace, assuring him of their support. In his response, Governor Lalong expressed appreciation for the visit, saying he had drawn strength from his colleagues.
