Many university students have said they dislike using books and any other information resources the library provides, a couple of days to their exams. Some of them reveal that libraries can be quieter and didn’t give room to discussion group. Others said libraries and classrooms were crowded and distractions could come in various forms during the period. Abdulwahab Muhammad, a 400 Level student in Bayero University Kano (BUK) said he prefers to read his note books at open areas, under trees, alone. “Reading in an open place makes me more comfortable and I comprehend more. “I do not like reading in a quiet place because it makes reading dull for me and if I should go to the library I always end up sleeping due to its quiet ambience,” he added. Adam Salihu, a 200 Level student, said he liked reading in an open place to share ideas with friends and get more perspectives on what he reads. “You can make use of the library if you are not ready to make noise as group discussion is not allowed in there,” he said. A 300 Level student, Usman Hamisu, also reads his books in the bush under trees few days to exam. “For me, the library is inconvenient to read at this period due to congestion though I get scared while reading here (in the bush),” he stated. Pointing to the ground, he showed the carcass of a snake killed recently. “I am a hermit when I read,” said Solomon Nyam, a 100 Level student who also likes reading under trees in the bush like Hamisu, explaining that “I comprehend more,” there. Shakirat Jimoh, a 200 Level student, however said she preferred to use the library even when they were filled to capacity in preparation for the exam. Shuaib is of the Mass Comm Dept, BUK
