The Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service (KDIRS) said it has  generated N14.2 billion as Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) between  January and end of May. KDIRS Executive Chairman, Mukhtar Ahmed, made this known in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna on Friday. Ahmed said that the state has increased its IGR from an average of  N8000 million a month in 2015 to between N2.7 billion and N3.0 billion  monthly in 2018. According to him, the N14.2 billion generated in five months is far  above N11.5 billion generated in the whole of 2015 and more than  half  of the N23 billion generated in 2016. “Our target is to generate N4.0 billion a month and with the ongoing  reform in tax administration and revenue collection in the state, I am  very confident that we shall get there. “Already we are around N3.0 billion and the ongoing integration of  all 63 revenue generating agencies in the state via an electronic  platform will take us there and beyond.” He said that the revenue profile of the state has been on consistent  increase since the reform in revenue collection, beginning with the tax  law that established KDIRS in 2016 as the sole revenue collector in the  state. “The law among other things harmonised and abolished cash collection  as well as automated all revenue collection in the state,” Ahmed said. The chairman expressed confidence that the state would achieve the  N42 billion set IGR target by December, following the impressive  performance in the first five months. (NAN)
