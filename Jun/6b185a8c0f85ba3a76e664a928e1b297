The NGO unveiled its planned programme of action at its first Annual General Meeting held in Lagos. The FMEN Chairperson, Bimpe Pogson who addressed journalists at the event, said the Aid To Life project being introduced by the group shall be focusing on three key areas of “preparing the child for the environment, connect the child with the environment and make time for the child”. “The programme will consist of a series of four sessions of talks on practical application of the Montessori principles and practices given to parents in different communities around Lagos. The Aid To Life talks are clear, simple and straightforward advice that is easy to understand and most importantly, easy to apply,” Pogson said. To achieve its goal, the Coordinator, Aid To Life, Mrs Yinka Awobo-Pearse said the NGO has been reaching out to other groups of like minds, schools and individuals to seek partnership that can be beneficial to the Nigerian child.
