EU leaders are meeting in Brussels for two days of talks on migration that German Chancellor Angela Merkel described as “make or break” for the union. The EU leaders are deeply divided over how to handle the flow of Europe-bound refugees and migrants, despite a significant drop in arrivals this year. They will also discuss security, trans-Atlantic trade and their troubled ties with US President Donald Trump, economic sanctions on Russia, the bloc’s next long-term budget from 2021, the euro zone reform and Brexit, among others. Italy’s hardline new premier threatened on Thursday to block a joint EU statement on migration. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he would refuse to endorse the conclusions of the meeting in Brussels if fellow leaders fail to do more to help Italy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that the fate of the European Union (EU) rests on its ability to find a solution to deal with refugees and migrants arriving in Europe.
