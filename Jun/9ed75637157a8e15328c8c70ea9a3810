By Ojoma Akor Leaders of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) have said the National Executive Council (NEC) of the union approved suspension of its six weeks strike due to the sympathy it has for the suffering masses. The union had embarked on an industrial action on April 17 to demand upward adjustment of the Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS) as agreed in the Memorandum of Terms of Settlement signed on September 30, 2017 with the Federal Government. Briefing newsmen along some leaders of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday in Abuja, National Chairman of JOHESU, Biobelemoye Joy Josiah said the suspension was also aimed at paving way for further negotiations to continue next Monday. Josiah said the strike was not suspended because of the recent order by the National Industrial Court, but because the intervention of Senate President Bukola Saraki played a major role. The JOHESU leader said the strike action was not politically motivated but to save the health sector from imminent collapse. National chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) Ayuba Wabba assured the unions of the support of the NLC, saying it has a justified case. He noted that there were interventions by people in high places including President Muhammadu Buhari on resolving the strike. Wabba tasked the Minister of Health, Prof Isaac Adewole on fairness and justice for the workers going forward, adding that he must see himself as a minister of the Federal Government and not a minister of one profession. On the threat by the minister that the striking workers would not be paid, Wabba said the President and not the minister is the final authority.
