Lagos State Commissioner for Home Affairs, Dr. AbdulLateef AbdulHakeem, has asked Lagos residents to watch out for more people-oriented projects in all the 20 Local Governments and 37 Local Council Development Areas in the state under Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. Speaking with journalists at the weekend, the commissioner, who also pronounced the Governor as a special blessing from God to the people of the state, noted that despite the current economic challenges in the country, Lagos would “continue to witness more development projects because the state is in capable and competent hands.” AbdulHakeem said the ongoing Oshodi Transport Interchange was a reflection of the current administration’s resolve to bring about the turnaround development in the state’s transportation sector in line with what obtains in other developed nations.
