The United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Stuart Symington has urged Nigeria’s leaders and citizens to unite across divides to stop the unwarranted killings in some parts of the country. The envoy gave the advise yesterday at a reception to celebrate U.S. 242nd Independence anniversary in Abuja. He said, “Every day, all across this land, we work with good people to save lives and bend upwards the curve of economic growth, so that real opportunity and hope will outpace need. “But, far too often, we see the deaths of innocents whose hopes are stopped forever, by those whose awful acts reflect no good and serve no cause.  These innocents must not be forgotten. “Nigeria’s leaders and citizens have it in their power to make this killing stop now, if you are united across all regions, all occupations, and all faiths. “When you act together with sincerity and high purpose and sustained effort, you will end this violence.  This is not a goal, this is the Cup itself. And it will mean the World for you to lift it high!” According to him, security that lasts depends on strong citizens who support each other and their governments, saying “If ten million Nigerians mentor just a few people each, that will change the course of all those lives, this Nation, and our world.” He said the embassy would reach out to other diplomatic missions in Nigeria to join in reaching out to ten people each. “If every government civil servant in Nigeria, Nigerian and foreigners alike, regardless of their jobs, became a mentor to just a few people, it is remarkable to think what good we would do. “And finally, if every Nigerian in business, large and small, would do the same, that would spur an extraordinary burst of hope and opportunity,” he added.
