US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have arrived in Singapore for their historic summit. Mr Trump flew in aboard Air Force One, a few hours after Mr Kim touched down with his entourage. The two men are staying in separate hotels, not far from each other, and are preparing for Tuesday’s meeting on the resort island of Sentosa. Mr Kim told Singapore’s PM “the entire world is watching”. Mr Trump has called it a “one-time shot” at peace. The US hopes the summit will kick-start a process that eventually sees Mr Kim give up nuclear weapons. The two leaders have had an extraordinary up-and-down relationship over the past 18 months, trading insults and threatening war before abruptly changing tack and moving towards a face-to-face meeting. Mr Trump landed in Singapore later in the evening having flown from a contentious G7 meeting in Canada. He told a reporter he felt “very good” about the summit before heading to his hotel, the Shangri La, about half a mile from Mr Kim’s.
