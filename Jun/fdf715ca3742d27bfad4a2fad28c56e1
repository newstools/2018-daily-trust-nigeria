The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday described the Presidency’s statement on killings of innocent Nigerians in Plateau State as ‘callous, inhuman and brazenly divisive,’ saying the Presidency should apologise to Nigerians. The PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said Nigerians expected the Presidency to take immediate steps to restore order, safeguard the lives of the people, exert justice and bring succour to victims of the attacks. “It is unfortunate that rather than taking actions to get to the roots of killings and banditry in the land, President Muhammadu Buhari resorted to political colorations by engaging in his usual blame game of unnamed politicians. “It is equally disgusting that the Buhari Presidency relegated the main issue of the murder of our citizens and how to track down the perpetrators and bring them to book, thus confirming the fears of most Nigerians that this administration does not care about the lives of the people. “PDP insists that the basic responsibility of government, which is to ensure the safety and harmonious living of all Nigerians, ensure that our laws apply at all times and circumstances, without any fear or favour, has been completely abdicated by the Buhari administration,  thereby leaving our people at the mercy of marauders. “Moreover, it is shocking that the President, as the father of our nation had no soothing or reassuring words for the agonizing victims of the attack but aggravated their pains with the unguarded comments attributed to him by his media aide,” the opposition party said.
