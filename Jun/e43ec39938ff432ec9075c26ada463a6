Sloane Stephens spent 11 months sidelined by a left foot injury and the surgery that followed, never dreaming that less than a year after her return she would be one match from a second Grand Slam title. But the 25-year-old American, who had reached only one major semifinal before her injury woes, could do just that by beating Simona Halep in today’s French Open final to add to her US Open crown from last year. Just six weeks after being ranked 957 in the world, Stephens claimed her maiden Grand Slam title by thrashing good friend Madison Keys 6-3, 6-0 at Flushing Meadows last September. She saw off her compatriot again on Thursday in straight sets at Roland Garros to set up the clash with world No 1 Halep. “After not playing for 11 months, it’s some great results,” said Stephens, who also won the Miami Open title earlier this year. “Obviously a lot of hard work went into it, a lot of adversity, a lot of ups and downs. “A lot of emotions, like, you know, am I ever going to be the same? Am I ever going to play good again at a high enough level? Am I a protected ranking? There were so many things that went into it. “And I think now I’ve kind of matured a little bit and have recognised the opportunities when they have been presented.” When she started her injury comeback at Wimbledon last July with a first-round loss to Alison Riske, even a return to the top 100 seemed a long way off. But she found form with back-to-back semifinals in Toronto and Cincinnati before winning the US Open as the world number 82. It hasn’t all been plain sailing since, though, as she suffered a severe hangover after her New York triumph.
