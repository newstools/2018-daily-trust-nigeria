The Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki has lamented killings in parts of the country, especially in Plateau state. He said the incidents require drastic action from both the National Assembly and the Presidency. He added that the National Assembly under his leadership would not shy away from its responsibilities.  Saraki spoke with newsmen in Ilorin, the Kwara state capital after an assessment tour of some areas in the metropolis.  He added : â€œAs you know very much, that the National Assembly under my leadership many months ago had seen the danger.  "We had called for security summit to address the issue of security architecture. We had seen the need for us to review the security structure.  "We had invited service chiefs on the matter. You are all very aware that some service chiefs decided in their own wisdom that there is no need for them to work with the NASS to address these issues.
