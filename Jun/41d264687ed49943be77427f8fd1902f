The APC Northern Musicians Forum (ANMFO) has alleged that corrupt politicians and looters who do not want President Muhammadu Buhari to win the 2019 presidential election are behind the “crisis” rocking the forum. The forum made the allegation yesterday through its National Vice President, Alhaji Murtala Mamsa Jos, during a press conference in Jos. ANMFO recalled that it was in the news after some of its members alleged that the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the forum, as well as President Buhari’s praise singer, Dauda Kahutu Rarara, and some of his “kitchen cabinet” had diverted N100m given to it by the Northern Governors’ Forum (NGF) through Gov. Abdul’Aziz Yari of Zamfara State. When contacted, the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to Gov. Yari, Ibrahim Dosara, clarified that the Zamfara State Government only gave the forum N20m after the forum solicited for assistance to open an office in Kaduna and to buy a bus.
