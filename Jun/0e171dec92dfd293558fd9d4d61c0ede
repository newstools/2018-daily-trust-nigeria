The House of Representatives has resolved to probe Reps Abdulmumin Jibrin and Muhammad Gudaji Kazaure over their comments that the House was planning to impeach President Muhammad Buhari. While Jibrin said that the joint closed-door session of the both the Senate and the House held on Tuesday was a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) affair, Kazaure accused some members of the House of collecting signatures to impeach Buhari.

Kazaure mentioned the names of Reps Ossai Nicholas Ossai (PDP, Delta) and Kingsley Chinda (PDP, Rivers) as some of those that signed the impeachment document.

But two lawmakers raised the issue on the floor on Wednesday, saying it affected their privileges.

Reps Sunday Karimi and Ossai were the ones that brought the two issues on the floor of the House under matters of privileges.

Consequently, the matter was referred to the committee on ethics and privileges to investigate and get back to the House.
