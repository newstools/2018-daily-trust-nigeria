The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusuf Buratai on Thursday said though a lot has been done to eliminate Boko Haram insurgents, the military is coming up with new strategies to end kidnapping and cattle rustling in northern Nigeria. The Army Chief in a special Eid-el-Fitri message ‎commended personnel for their tireless contribution towards sustaining peace and security across the country and urged them to remain professionally focused. Buratai said that the army was re-strategizing to decisively deal with kidnapping and cattle rustling in the North Central and North Western regions of the nation. "These feats no doubt are calls for officers and soldiers to redouble our efforts in the collective discharge of our constitutional roles. "In the pursuit of this, I charge you all to maintain disciplined, be committed, dedicated, resilient and courageous in the discharge of your duties," he said. According to Buratai, the Army has recorded several achievements in operations across the country which include ‎the conduct of Op Deep Punch II, Ex Ayem Akpatuma (Ex Cat Race) Op Last Hold which is ongoing and the hosting of the African Land Forces Summit in Abuja, among others. "Furthermore, we have effectively tackled the Boko Haram Insurgency. “May I at this point reiterate my total commitment towards achieving my vision for the NA. It is my desire to transform the NA into a more potent and professionally-responsive force that will effectively curtail contemporary security challenges. "To this end, I want to reassure you all that issues bothering on training and welfare will continue to receive my utmost attention. We shall continue to do our best to ensure the wellbeing of our officers and soldiers as well as their families,” Buratai said.
