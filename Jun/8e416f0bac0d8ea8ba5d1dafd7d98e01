Senator Abdulaziz Nyako has said that he and others are in talks with Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso about a new political party. Nyako who represents Adamawa Central at the Senate said he was preparing with the teeming supporters of his father and former Adamawa State governor, Murtala Nyako, to leave the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) due to marginalization, according to a Premium Times report. A member of the new Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP) bloc in the APC, the senator told his supporters in Adamawa that there was no going back in their decision. “We have no option than to go; but we are still discussing the party to move to with our entire structure. I have spoken with Prof. Jerry Gana in SDP. I also spoke with Attahiru Bafarawa and fixed an appointment for him with Admiral Nyako. Bafarawa wants us to return to PDP,” he said. “On Thursday, I went to Abeokuta and sat (down) with (former president) Obasanjo about ADC. He directed me to see Col. Oyinlola who assured us that we will be absorbed with our structures if we join the party. I also spoke with Kwankwaso (former Kano governor) before the congresses,” he said. Sen Nyako said that Kwankwaso spoke about “a new party coming up. “I was given the party’s constitution about a month ago, it’s a new party expected to be approved soon with four others by INEC,” Mr Nyako said, adding that he was happy they were leaving APC ”before it’s too late.”
