The National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, has urged all Nigerians to use the Eid-el-Fitri to reflect on the situation in the country and pray for peaceful conduct of the 2019 general elections. In a Sallah message yesterday he said the nation’s democracy was under ‘heavy stress’ and required more hands on deck for survival. He also urged the APC-led federal government to imbibe the spirit of tolerance and shun all ‘undemocratic tendencies’ such as acts of intimidation, harassment and bullying of the opposition by operatives of federal agencies. “If leaders absorb the lessons of Ramadan and allow it influence their conduct, most of the problems confronting the ordinary people would have been solved. “Those past 30 days of fasting and prayers will be meaningful in our lives as a nation if we allow the solemnness of the period influence our thoughts and actions in relating with one another,” he said.
