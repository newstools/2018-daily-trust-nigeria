A magistrate’s court sitting in Suleja, Niger State, has remanded a 50-year-old chemist operator from Sabon Wuse town in Tafa Local Government Area of the state over allegation of molesting three underage girls. Ezeh Cosmos, who was said to be living close to his victim’s home was earlier arrested on 9th June by the police from Sabon Wuse division where the matter was reported. The police prosecutor, Jonathan Garba, had informed the court  that the mother of one of the victims, who reported the matter to the police,  said her daughter, a seven-year-old girl was lured by the suspect into his room while she was sent on an errand. He told the court that Cosmos raped her as she revealed to her mother when she noticed her walking with a limp. The prosecutor also said a medical report confirmed that the girl was raped. Garba further informed the court that police investigations revealed that the accused had raped two siblings, a girl of eight years and her elder sister of 10 years in the neighbourhood. The accused person, however, denied all the charges and sought for bail. Magistrate Maryam Jibo, however turned down the bail application and adjourned the matter to July 12 for further hearing.
