The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Walter Onnoghen has charged newly sworn in judges of the Federal High Court to always be guided by the Constitution while carrying out their activities. Justice Onnoghen, who gave the charge in Abuja yesterday while performing the swearing ceremony for the judges, also advised them to abide by the Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers in Nigeria. “When you apply the law, you will never go wrong. You should not make yourselves as agents to be used by politicians or anybody at all in the discharge of your responsibilities because when the chips are down, you find yourself completely alone, and not only yourself but your family,” he said. “Be in charge of your court by mastering the law and applying the law to the facts,” he added. The nine justices who took their oath are: Sunday Bassey Onu, Adefunmilola Adekemi Demi-Ajayi, Justice Peter O. Lifu, Obiora Atuegwu Egwuata, Sa’adatu Ibrahim Mark, Mobolaji Olubukola Olajuwon, Aminu Bappa Aliyu, Tijjani Garba Ringim, and Nkeonye Evelyn Maha.
