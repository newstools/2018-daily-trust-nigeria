Malaysian police have seized a trove of jewellery, handbags and cash worth up to $273m (Â£206m) from properties linked to former prime minister Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor. A $1.6m gold and diamond necklace, 14 tiaras and 272 Hermes bags were taken as part of corruption investigations into state investment fund 1MDB. Billions of dollars are unaccounted for from the fund, set up by Mr Najib. He has been under investigation since his shock election loss in May. Police describe the seizure of valuables as the biggest in Malaysian history.
