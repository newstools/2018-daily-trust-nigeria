Bishop Emmanuel Badejo  of the Catholic Diocese of Oyo on Friday   appealed to Nigerians  to continue to respect the religious values and  beliefs of one another to strengthen the nation’s unity. Badejo said this in his Eid-ul-Fitri message  where he condemned shedding of innocent blood  in some parts of the country. He also advised Nigerians to shun leaders who exploited religious sentiments as a tool for their own  selfish political gains. He said that Nigerians should, rather,  uphold values that would make them human and more humane with one another. “I also wish to cherish the legacy of our peaceful coexistence and collaboration in Oyo State. “As you know, the Catholic Diocese of Oyo  is very particularly  interested and involved in interreligious dialogue and collaboration. “I trust that the same can be said about you, our Muslim brethren,   and I thank you for this necessary disposition which can only engender  peace and harmony. “In view of the unfortunate happenings of intolerance and bloodshed  in some parts of our country, I seize this opportunity to urge that we  all do more to promote religious harmony. “Pope Francis in his letter to Muslims for the Month of Ramadan and  ‘Id Al-Fitr 1439H, pointed out that we must avoid the spirit of  competition that has too often marked past relations between Christians  and Muslims. “The negative consequences of which are evident in: jealousy, recriminations and tensions. “Such interreligious competition wounds the image of religions and  their followers, and it fosters the view that religions are not sources  of peace, but of tension and violence. “May Allah accept your supplications and endow you with his numerous blessings. “It is our belief that your prayers will reach the throne of God and  bring much divine favour and grace upon our country , Nigeria, and all  our families,” he said (NAN)
