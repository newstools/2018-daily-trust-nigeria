The Vice Chancellor of Ajayi Crowther University, Professor Dapo Folorunsho Asaju, has condemned the mass exodus of Nigeria-trained doctors into the United Kingdom. He described it as impending calamity that may affect Nigeria health sector in the future. He noted that his recent visit to the United Kingdom indicated that ninety percent of those writing examinations to practice medicine in the United Kingdom were doctors from Nigeria. Professor Asaju raised the alarm while presenting the 74th Interdisciplinary discourse of the University of Ibadan, Postgraduate school entitled “Religious undercurrents in the evolution of education in Global context.” He said it is sad that the federal government of Nigeria seemed unperturbed by the massive brain drain which will make many Nigerians die in the absence of qualified medical doctors. In his remarks, the Vice Chancellor University of Ibadan, Professor Idowu Olayinka said Nigeria must determine the place of religion in its educational system given the confusion and controversies surrounding the role religion in our communal life.
