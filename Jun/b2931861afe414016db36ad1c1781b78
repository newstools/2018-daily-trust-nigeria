A Federal High Court in Kaduna has granted bail to a former governor of Kaduna State, Alhaji Ramalan Yero, and three others standing trial over an alleged case of fraud. The three others are a former state chairman of PDP, Abubakar Gaya-Haruna; former Secretary to the State Government, Hamza Ishaq; and a former Minister of Power, Nuhu Somo Wya. Justice Muhammad Shuaibu granted bail to the accused persons in the sum of N100m each and two sureties in the like sum. The sureties, the court ruled, must reside within its jurisdiction and deposit their international passports. Counsel to the defendants, Ustaz Yunus,SAN, had argued that since the former governor had been on administrative bail for the past six months, “he did not temper with investigation and there is no indication that he will do so.” But the Prosecuting Counsel, Joshua Saidi, said the accused is an influential member of the society who could temper with investigation processes. Justice Shuaibu after taking the arguments granted them bail and adjourned the case to September 26, 2018 for hearing. Yero and others are standing trial over an alleged case of fraud instituted against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The court had last week ordered that the former governor and three others be remanded in prison custody pending yesterday’s bail hearing. Daily Trust reports that the court room was filled as thousands of supporters of the former governor as well as those of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) besieged the court premises, chanting solidarity songs. The supporters carried placards with inscriptions such as ‘Free Ramalan Yero’, ‘Injustice is threat to democracy’, ‘From prison back to Sir Kashim Ibrahim House’, ‘No more APC/El-Rufai by Zazzau Emirate Youth’, ‘APC is not government of the people’, APC is not democratic government,’ etc. Some of them gathered heaps of brooms and burnt them to mock the APC.
