The wife of the National security Adviser (NSA), Hajiya Nafisa Monguno, has supported 10, 000 orphans and widows in Kaduna with food and non-food items in the spirit of the holy month of Ramadan. The gesture was organised by Precious Little Lives Initiative (PreLLi) in collaboration with Ummulkhari Foundation and Nigerian Tulip International Colleges Foundation (NTICF) to bring succor for the less privileged in the society. “As a Muslim, no one needs to tell me to give charity because the Almighty Allah already told us to do so and it is only by giving charity that the society can tackle the menace of drug abuse and Almajiranci, which has become a very disturbing issue. “All of us are less privileged in one way or the other be it financially, mentally or physically, but we are all here now, we pray to Almighty Allah to accept our good deeds and have mercy on our souls.” She commended the other organisations for the support they have been giving to orphans and widows and urged them not to relent.
