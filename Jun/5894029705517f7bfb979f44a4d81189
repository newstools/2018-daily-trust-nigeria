President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the late president of Court of Appeal and pioneer chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC), Justice Mustapha Akanbi, laid foundation of a critical pillar of Nigeria's nascent anti-graft institutional framework.

Speaking at the eighth day firdau prayer for the late judicial icon in Ilorin on Sunday, President Buhari, represented by the attorney general of the federation and minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami who led federal government delegation to the event, said that, "so many years after completion of his tenure of office, he remained a strong and persuasive moral voice in articulation and implementation of Nigeria's anti-corruption agenda.

"The legacy Justice Akanbi left behind for Nigeria in general and for the legal profession in particular is one that will continue to inspire us all for years to come."

The President, who said that the country would forever be grateful to the late Justice Akanbi for his positive contributions, added that he would be remembered in noble terms and that Nigeria would continue to be inspired by his ideals and values.
