The Managing Director of JAMUB Group of Companies, Prince Jacob Momoh has said without education, it becomes near impossible for young Nigerians to rise to the pinnacle of their careers in life. Momoh stated this on Wednesday in Abuja when the National Association of University Students (NAUS) awarded him “The Most Innovative and outstanding entrepreneur in Nigeria” for his role in educating and training of youths. He said the drive to making Nigerian youth opened to education has birthed the SchoolMEScholarship lottery to raise fund creatively to mitigate the cost of education. While noting that the project is billed to be launched soon, he said no child should be denied the opportunity of getting at least the basic of education “The lottery was conceived to raise funds creatively to at least lessen social menace that has been identified with youth who do not have access to education,” he said. He however advised the students to remain focused, honest and transparent in all their dealings and believe God to see them through. Speaking on reason for the award, the Chairman College of Past Presidents of NAUS Solomon Adodo said the group have a soft spot for quality education and has been involved in areas of youth training. “We look at presently a scholarship programme the company is coming up with which will afford students the opportunity to quality education is what we welcome, education that can give to society this is what JAMUB does and that is why we have chosen them,” he said.
