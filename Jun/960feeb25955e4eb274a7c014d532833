A national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has described former President Olusegun Obasanjo as an election rigger and a busybody for daring to advise President Muhammadu Buharu not to seek re-election in 2019. But in a reaction, an aide to Obasanjo, who preferred anonymity, said it was unfortunate that such remark came from people who begged the former president for support in 2015. “These are people who came to the man three years ago to beg him (Obasanjo). People are aware of this. You are now telling him to keep quiet. These people, including Tinubu himself came to the man for support. He did not go to them. The man is now saying that things are not going the way it should go. He (Buhari) cannot continue,” the aide said. Tinubu spoke yesterday in Abuja at the end of the APC Convention, saying “One uncle back then who had being a general himself and who had being an elected president, I call him election rigger, he had the effrontery to say Buhari must not run again, in which party? Thank God he is not a member of our party.”
