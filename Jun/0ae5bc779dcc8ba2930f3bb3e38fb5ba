The Federal Government said it is almost concluding the processes of repatriating additional $500 million loot from the United Kingdom, the United States, France and others. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said this while briefing State House reporters on the outcome of yesterdayâ€™s cabinet meeting. The minister said Nigeria had engaged the UK, US, France and others in further negotiations on the repatriation of the fund. He recalled that last December, the Federal Government participated in the global forum on asset recovery in Washington DC where Nigeria and Switzerland signed the agreement that paved way for the repatriation of $322 million looted assets.
