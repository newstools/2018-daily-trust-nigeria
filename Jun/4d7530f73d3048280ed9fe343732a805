South Sudan’s president Salva Kiir, and the rebel leader Riek Machar, have reportedly broken a deadlock in peace talks being held in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. Sudan’s foreign minister, Al-Dirdiri Mohamed Ahmed, said they had reached agreement on “some points”, details of which would be announced on Wednesday. Thousands of people have been killed and more than four million displaced in the civil war that was triggered by the rivalry between the two men. The peace deal is being proposed by the regional bloc, IGAD. Reports in some African media say the two rivals have inked an agreement for a permanent ceasefire. When talks began last week, it was the first time Mr Machar had met face-to-face with his rival, President Kiir, in almost two years.
