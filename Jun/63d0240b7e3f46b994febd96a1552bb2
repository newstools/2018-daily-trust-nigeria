As Nigerians join the rest of the world to mark the International Women’s Day, a nongovernmental organisation, Helpline Foundation for the Needy, Abuja, says it will  give out interest-free  loans to widows in the FCT. The foundation said the scheme was part of its effort to empower widows to be self-reliant and self-sustaining in a male-dominated economy. Founder of  the foundation Dr. Jummai Ahmadu, called on government at all levels to initiate policies and programmes that would address the plight of widows in the country. Ahmadu told journalists in Abuja that the foundation has identified 12 clusters in the six area councils of the territory where the loans would be disbursed to widows, adding that the foundation targeted no fewer than 5000 widows to benefit from the revolving loan scheme in the next three years. “In the FCT, we have noticed with serious concern how the figure of widows increases on a yearly basis. In 2017, we targeted 300 widows, but we ended up with 350 been empowered and this year the figure has also increased considerably,” she said.
