The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has described the former Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC) Justice Mustapha Akanbi, who passed away on Sunday, as a man of great vision and intellect who was for the unity of Nigeria. The forum said this in a statement signed by Muhammad Ibrahim Biu yesterday. It said the late Justice Akanbi, who rose to become President of the Court of Appeal, was an embodiment of hard work, diligence and loyalty to the cause of nation building. “He was a great public servant who left an indelible mark especially in shaping the judiciary and fight against corruption. Justice Akanbi was also one of the great pillars that formed and nurtured ACF to its present position as the voice of the North. “The late elder statesman would be remembered for his commitment to national unity, transparency, philanthropic works and selfless service to his father land,” the forum stated.
