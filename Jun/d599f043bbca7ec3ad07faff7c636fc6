The coalition of Bassa elites has urged governors Yahaya Bello of Kogi and Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa states respectively to take immediate action on the extrajudicial killings of their kinsmen in the two states. The Publicity Secretary of the council, Ndazhaga Nyizo, said in Abuja in a statement on Friday that their concern was necessitated by the recent communal clashes between the Bassa and their historical neighbours, the Egbura ethnic nationalities in Bassa and Toto local governments of Kogi and Nasarawa states respectively. He said this was followed by series of controversies of an alleged stage-managed armed robbery on 29th May, 2018 by their neighbour where one of their own was killed accidently but that the Bassas were blamed for the attack to justify an attack on them leading to the killing of 13 Bassas. “The coalition is aware of the peace meeting by the Ohimege, traditional ruler of Igu chiefdom who oversees Okpareke which was the center of the carnage. The coalition commends the Ohimege for his effort to ensure that lasting peace returns and is sustained in his chiefdom. However, report available to this coalition has it that some unscrupulous elements have vowed to ignore the peace parley reached by the stakeholders of Bassa and Egbura at the instance of the Ohimege. “Plans, as learnt are already concluded to strike at any given time in various communities where Bassa are found immediately after the Salah celebration. This, we want the governors of both affected states, Nigerians as well as the world at large to be informed and take appropriate measures to stop this plot towards ethnic cleansing agenda,” Nyizo said.
