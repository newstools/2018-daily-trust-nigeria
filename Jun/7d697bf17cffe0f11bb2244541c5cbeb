The Accountant -General of the Federation (AGF), Mr Ahmed Idris has wadded into the challenges involved with the enrolment of Nigeria Police Force staff on the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System(IPPIS) platform, as he now oversees the resolution process. Mr. Ahmed Idris, took this decision, while receiving a delegation of the Authorities of the Nigerian Police Force, led by Assistant Inspector General of Police, (AIG)  Abdul  Salami Iyaji, to deliver a letter from the Inspector General of Police and to discuss other matters of mutual interest,  a statement signed by Mr. Oise Johnson, the Head Press and Public Relations OAGF has said. He directed the Nigeria Police to submit all the required documents requested by the IPPIS department to his office and that he will personally supervise the process of resolving the matters immediately. Mr. Idris also directed the IPPIS Consultant, Messers Soft Alliance to immediately deploy additional personnel to ensure that all issues are resolved within the shortest time possible. He explained to the delegation that the complaints on shortfall in the salary payment has to do with statutory deductions on the IPPIS platform which is applicable to every employee on the platform, some of which include, the National Housing Fund(NHF), which is 2.5 per cent of the basic salary, Employees Pension  and PAYE tax as stipulated by the Joint tax board , which nobody can do anything about. In addition, on the issue of newly promoted police officers, the AGF directed the police to make a comprehensive list of all officers involved, indicating their IPPIS numbers. This is with the view to addressing the matter holistically to avoid any body being left out.
