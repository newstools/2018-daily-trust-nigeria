A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, has sentenced a 34-year-old cook, Chigozie Oguikpe, to two months imprisonment for reckless driving. Oguikpe, of old Karmo, Abuja, was arraigned on a one-count charge of dangerous driving, an offence he admitted committing and begged for leniency. The Judge, Maiwa Inuwa, however, gave the convict an option of N5,000 fine. Inuwa, who warned Oguikpe to shun crime and be a good citizen, expressed hope that the sentence would serve as deterrent to others. He ordered Oguikpe to pay N70,000 as compensation to the nominal complainant. The Prosecutor, Mrs. Ukagha Ijeoma, told the court that on March 7, Oguikpe drove a Sienna bus with registration number, YAB-49 NK, on Karmo Life Camp Road, Abuja, in a dangerous and reckless manner. She said Oguikpe collided with an oncoming Peugeot 406 wagon with registration number, RBC-793 CC, driven by the complainant, Olameji Oladayo, of Wuye, Abuja. The prosecutor also said as a result of the accident, the Peugeot wagon was badly damaged and put the cost of repair at N250,000. Ijeoma said Oguikpe paid N180,000 to Oladayo and refused to pay the balance of N70,000. She said the offence contravened Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act. (NAN)
