The Police Service Commission (PSC) said newly recruited police constables are expected at their different training colleges nationwide today. A statement yesterday by the spokesman of the PSC, Ikechukwu Ani said, the Commission on Thursday, June 7, 2018 uploaded the list of 6,491 successful candidates on its recruitment portal, psc.org.ng <http://psc.org.ng> with specific instructions on how, when and where to report for training. He said the training colleges were opened to admit the new recruits from Friday, June 8, and will last till today June 13, 2018. He added that, successful candidates were required to visit the Police Command Headquarters in their states of origin to check their names and colleges for training. Ani said 6,491 candidates were recruited, 491 higher than the presidential approval of 6,000. He said in recent recruitment exercise where 10,000 were to be enlisted, only about 9,000 passed out at the end of the exercise due to various reasons, including certificate forgery. He said the Police have complained of lack of manpower especially at the Constable level and wanted to maximize the benefit of the presidential approval by ensuring that 6,000 Constables were admitted at the end of the training programme.
