Two members of the Shiites group in Plateau State yesterday dragged the Commander of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), Major-General Anthony Atolagbe to court over claims of unlawful arrest and detention. The suit which came up for hearing before Justice Muhammad Sirajo of the State high court 3, was adjourned to the 19 June, 2018, to allow the defence counsel reply to the suit. Daily Trust reports that the suit is filed by Idris Muhammad and Auwal Usaini who are seeking for the enforcement of their fundamental human rights as allegedly violated by men of the multi-security taskforce under the command of General Atolagbe. The duo averred that they were arrested on the 31st of March, 2018 while cleaning their destroyed place of worship around Anguwan Rogo, in Jos north when men of the taskforce arrested and unlawfully kept them in detention at the taskforce headquarters for more than two months. The plaintiffs are seeking for an order of the court to direct OPSH to release them, and also pay them damages of N2 million.
