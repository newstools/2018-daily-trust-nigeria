The Federal Government has flagged-off the reconstruction of Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria to Kano expressway, at a cost of N155.4 billion Speaking during the flag-off ceremony yesterday at Ciromawa in Garun Malam Local Government Area of Kano State, Minister of Power, Works and Housing Babatunde Raji Fashola said the Federal Executive Council gave approval for reconstruction of the expressway based on its importance as the major road linking the North and South of the country. He said reconstruction of the 375.4km expressway was awarded to Julius Berger with a completion period of 36 months. Fashola said the project would be executed simultaneously in three phases saying “There will be no reason to stop work for lack of funds as the President had assured us of that, the work will continue non-stop till we gathered here again to commission it.” The Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, commended the Federal Government on its decision to reconstruct the road, which was being described by motorists as ‘death trap’ due to its deplorable state for decades.
