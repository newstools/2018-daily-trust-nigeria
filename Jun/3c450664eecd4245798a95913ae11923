The Senate yesterday confirmed four out of five nominees of President Muhammadu Buhari for the board of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The Senate rejected the nomination of Dr Abdu Abubakar, representing North West zone, saying he failed integrity test. Those confirmed are; Ummu Ahmed Jalingo (North East), Justina Odinakachukwu Nnabuko (South East), Mike I. Obadan (South South) and Adeola Adetunji (South West). Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and other financial institutions, Senator Rafiu Ibrahim (APC,Kwara) said the confirmed nominees displayed adequate knowledge of operations of the CBN, saying they are fit to be non- Executive Directors of the CBN. Senate President Bukola Saraki asked the committee to revisit the issue of Dr Abubakar and report back on the next legislative day.
