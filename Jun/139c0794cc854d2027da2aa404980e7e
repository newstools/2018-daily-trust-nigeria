Former vice president Atiku Abubakar has cautioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) led government against what he called departure from constitutional due process to tendencies of authoritarianism. Atiku, in a statement yesterday by his Media Office to mark the 25th anniversary of June 12, said there were growing culture of arbitrariness in some institutions of government at all levels. He said the very foundation of a democratic society is the guarantee of fundamental human rights that gives the citizenry the freedom of speech, movement and the ability of the people to belong to any lawful association that they deem inclined. He called on all political actors to let June 12 and all that it embodies, inspire them to promote democratic principles, especially as Nigeria is about to go to the polls in 2019.
