The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) warned the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government against arresting Obasanjo. The PDP in a statement last night said it was shocked by the former president’s alarm. ”PDP wants the APC and Buhari presidency to note that no amount of coercion, intimidation and illegal arrests will alter the determination  of Nigerians to vote out the dysfunctional APC and rescue our nation, come 2019,” the party said. Also reacting, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar appealed to President Buhari to call the security agencies to order in order to douse the tension in the land, and advised the government and its agents to retrace their steps to avoid aggravating the already overheated polity.
