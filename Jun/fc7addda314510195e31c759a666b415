Coalition of civil society organizations for Justice and Equity (CCSO-JE) has expressed displeasure over the Nigeria Police Force refusal to obey court orders to unseal the Peace Corps of Nigeria corporate headquarters located in Jabi, Abuja.
The group, yesterday, stormed the premises of the Human Rights Commission to register its grievances over disregard for court orders regarding the Peace Corps case by the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris.
Presenting its case at the commission, the group`s chief convener, Olayemi Success recalled that two Federal High Courts in Abuja on November 9, 2017 and January 15, 2018 respectively, ruled that the action of the police in sealing the office was reckless and an infringement on the fundamental rights of the corps and therefore ordered that the office be unsealed forthwith.
“Consequently, the nation’s chief legal officer and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami followed it up by writing different letters to the IGP telling him to comply with these judgment, an order the IGP has continuously refused to comply with till date,”  he said.
While responding Human Rights Commission Director of Corporate Services, Mr Lambert Opara  assured that the commission would look into the matter.
