The Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has called on Nigerians to ignore a “satanic video” linking him to the killings of over 200 persons in some villages of Barkin Ladi local government area of Plateau State.  Tambuwal who was on a condolence visit to the Government and people of Plateau State alongside governors of Bauchi, Zamfara, Benue, Imo, Delta and Nasarawa states as well as Deputy Governors of Kaduna, Akwa Ibom, Oyo, Ondo and Edo states said “I have no hands in this, I should not be associated with it; people should ignore this satanic video which is trying to incite the people against one another.” He said Plateau was like a second home to him which he frequented since becoming governor. The governor said he has called the attention of security agencies to the video and was notified that it was created and circulated during the last administration.
