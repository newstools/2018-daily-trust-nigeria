The undercover operatives of Lagos State Police Command attached to Ojo Police Station, have arrested one Mr. Uche Julian Nwajiakwu, for impersonation as a lawyer. Uche was arrested at a Magistrate Court, Ojo, Lagos State while posing as a lawyer to defend an accused person. Uche’s arrest was the second  time  a fake lawyer would be arrested at Ojo Magistrate Court. The first was the arrest of one Chris Elisha. Elisha was arrested on February 6, 2018, 15 years after he had been in illegal practice. Police said that Uche Julian Nwajiakwu admitted  to have been in the game since 2015. Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, who confirmed the arrest, said that the suspect confessed to have fallen in love with law practice when a friend of his commissioned him to act as a lawyer in order to serve his tenant a quit notice, the assignment Oti said was successfully carried out and Nwajiakwu was handsomely rewarded and that ever since then, the suspect has been in the business. He said: “However, luck ran out on Nwajiakwu on May 25, 2018, while he was arguing on a bail application for his client, an intelligent lawyers in the court suspected  he was a laid back. The lawyers said his quackery was too obvious to be ignored.” The police spokesman said investigation into the case thus far, revealed that the suspect did not study law in any of the Nigerian universities nor anywhere else  in the world.
