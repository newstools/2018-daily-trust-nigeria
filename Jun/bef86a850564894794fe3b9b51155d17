Road Marshals of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in the Federal Capital Territory Command have been urged to shun  violence while engaging with  motorists. While speaking to the officers yesterday in Abuja during a training session on emotional stability organised by Sustaining Continuity in Education Foundation (SCEF), the resource person, Dr. Okey Ibekwe, stressed the need for officers of the corps to be courteous while relating with motorists as their courteous nature could earn them some cooperation from the motorists. FCT Sector Commander of the corps, Wobin Gora, said the duty of the road marshal was to flag down a motorist and ask for either the particulars of the car or query a wrong behaviour by the motorist; which when sorted out the motorist drove on. Gora insisted that whenever a safety personnel was seen reacting to a motorist, then the motorist must have misbehaved. He said FRSC personnel had been trained to absorb shock and to be tolerant while carrying out their duties, but that they were also human therefore sometimes they over reacted. Gora noted that the gospel of emotional stability was preached to the personnel on duty on a daily basis. “We always tell our men never to allow anyone to upset them while carrying out their duty. No matter the insult, just absorb it,” he said. He warned the personnel never to get physical with any motorist, but rather ensure they got a witness or someone to video record any violent incident so that when the issue was taken to court, the motorist would be made to face the consequences. “Some motorists are out to make trouble and are ready to kill you,” he added. On her part, Chief Executive Officer of the foundation, Mrs. Rose Onyeukwu-Ashinze, said the training was organised to ensure that the personnel always carried out their duty with the right mind and right emotion.
