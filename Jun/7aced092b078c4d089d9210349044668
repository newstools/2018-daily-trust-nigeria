Yobe State government in collaboration with the Northeast Regional Initiative (NERI) has installed Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) microchips on 5000 animals to prevent rustling and track infectious diseases among livestock across the state. The Head of Animal Health Northeast sub-region Dr. Muhammad Yazid stated this while flagging off the programme at Babangida, the headquarters of Tarmuwa local government area. Yazid said the programme was aimed at arresting the incessant theft and rustling of livestock in Yobe and the northeast sub-region. The Head of Animal Development programme, Yobe Livestock Development Programme, Dr. Idrissa Yusuf, said the RFID microchips would help farmers track their animals when lost. One of the beneficiaries, Musa Badau, commended NERI and the state government over the initiative, saying the gesture will give livestock farmers more confidence and security to carry out their occupation.
