The Former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has donated N10 million to the victims of windstorm in Bauchi. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that last Saturday rainfall and windstorm destroyed properties, houses, offices business places, schools, mosques and churches in Bauchi metropolis. ‎Atiku made the donation on Monday when he visited the Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwan Adamu in his palace. ‎He said that he came to commiserate with the people and the state government over the recent windstorm and fire disaster in Bauchi and Azare town. The former VP explained that his visit to commiserate with the people of Bauchi was almost truncated because he had problem with the plane that was to bring him. “I am happy that I am able to make the visit today to Bauchi because I am determined to come here to sympathise with the citizens over the havoc. “I pray for the repose of the souls of those that lose their lives and to those that lose their properties. “I came with N10 million for the victims and I pray for God to forestall such occurrence in the future,” he said. In his remarks, the Emir of Bauchi, Rilwanu Adamu expressed his appreciation to the former Vice President for the visit, saying that the gesture was a demonstration of his love to the people of the state. “We deeply appreciate your support and love of the people of Bauchi. “All we can say is that the windstorm and the fire that engulfed the market in Azare are trials from God and we pray that such will not happen again. The Emir, however, assured Alhaji Atiku that the money will get to the victims through the committee set up by the state government. Atiku and his entourage also proceeded to Azare to commiserate with the people over the fire incident that destroyed over 1, 000 shops in Azare market (NAN)
