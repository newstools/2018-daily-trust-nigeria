Justice Adebukola Banjoko has began delivering judgment in the fraud charge against former Governor of Plateau State, Senator Joshua Dariye. 

The judge started sitting by 9:12am after the defendant arrived around 9:08am. 

Dariye was dressed in a white (spotted) baba-riga with a stripe blue cap. 

Our reporter observed there was heavy and tight security at the court as there were three security checkpoints on the street leading to the court house. Each of the security checkpoint, manned by heavily armed mobile policemen, scrutinised motorists. 

The third checkpoint had Explosive Ordinance Detection (EOD) officials checking each vehicles for explosives. 

At the entrance to the court room, two police officers frisk people before granting them entrance into the court room.

He is standing trial in a N1.162 billion fraud charge brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). 

Dariye is being prosecuted before an FCT High Court in Gudu for allegedly diverting about N1.162 billion from the stateâ€™s Ecological Fund to private companies and individuals.
