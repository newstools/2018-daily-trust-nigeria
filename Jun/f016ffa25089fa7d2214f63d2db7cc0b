The Plateau Concerned Professionals Forum (PCPF) has urged Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong, to improve his relationship with security agencies in the state. The forum accused the governor of being ‘complacent’ with security of the state, urging him to develop the political will needed to end killings in the state. The Convener of the forum, Dr Pam Chuwang, decried the renewed killings in some parts of the state, describing the violence as not only barbaric and reprehensible but also untenable and unacceptable. Chuwang in a statement released yesterday in Abuja, said “The Plateau government needs to urgently develop the political will to end these killings in the state. How can people be killed like animals just like that? While we focus on the appeal for a total non-reoccurring situation in the state, it is important to call on the state government to further consolidate on the existing relationship with the security formations, particularly Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), the Nigeria Police Mobile Force and the Department for State Service (DSS) to bring to the barest minimum these unfortunate incidences,” he said.
