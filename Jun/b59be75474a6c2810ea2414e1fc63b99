Turkey’s long-standing leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan is ahead in presidential elections with 62% of votes counted, according to state media. Mr Erdogan has 56%, and his closest rival, Muharrem Ince, is on 29%. If Mr Erdogan wins more than 50% of the overall vote, he will be declared the winner and avoid the need for a second round of voting. As well as the presidency, voters are also choosing members of parliament. Mr Erdogan’s party is ahead in that poll. With 51% of the votes for parliament counted, the president’s AK Party leads with 46% of the votes, the state news agency Anadolu reports. The main opposition CHP is on 20%. Voter turnout is high at almost 87%, the state broadcaster says. Initial results were thought likely to favour the AK Party, so Mr Erdogan’s lead is expected to decrease as more votes are counted. Mr Erdogan is seeking a second term as president, and would govern under a new constitution which grants the president new powers.
