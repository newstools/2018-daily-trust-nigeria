Senator Buruji Kashamu has asked the Supreme Court to determine the decision of the Court of Appeal which set aside two judgments stopping his extradition to the USA over drug-related offences. The Court of Appeal in Lagos had on May 4 nullified the judgements of the Federal High Courts in Lagos and Abuja, which restrained the Federal Government from proceeding with the extradition process. The panel of the appellate court judges presided by Justice Joseph Ikyeghi held that the orders made by Justice Okon Abang, which relied on an affidavit evidence that former President Olusegun Obasanjo was behind the moves in stopping Kashamu’s extradition, were “invalid, nonsensical and unacceptable” to the laws because they were based on hearsay and speculations. A counsel to Senator Kashamu’s legal team comprising Lateef Fagbemi, Alex Izinyon, Olusegun Odubela, all Senior Advocates of Nigeria, confirmed the filing of the appeal before the Supreme Court over the weekend. Another Federal High Court in Abuja presided by Justice Ahmed Mohammed had on May 30 refused an ex parte application by Kashamu’s counsel, Izinyon seeking to protect his fundamental human rights against the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). The judge directed the applicant to serve the AGF and NDLEA notice of the suit before it to enable them respond during the hearing on July 2. Izinyon had told the court his client was afraid and apprehensive that the Federal Government may pick him and extradite him to USA on the strength of the earlier judgement of the Court of Appeal. Meanwhile, the AGF represented by Emeka Ngige (SAN) has filed a counter affidavit asking the Supreme Court to refuse Kashamu’s appeal and uphold the decision of the Court of Appeal on the extradition proceedings.
