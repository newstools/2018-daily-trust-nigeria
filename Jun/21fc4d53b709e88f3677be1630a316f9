Four state chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from South-east geo-political zone have rejected the ‘Unity List’ allegedly prepared by the party’s governors which contradicted the position of zonal leaders. The state chairmen addressed newsmen at the APC national secretariat in Abuja yesterday. They include; Dr. Tony Nwoye (Enugu), Donatus Nwankpa (Abia), Eze Nwachukwu Eze (Ebonyi); and Barr. Emeka Obasi, Anambra. They said the zonal leaders had endorsed the re-election of Emma Eneukwu as National Vice Chairman, South East; Sen. Osita Izunaso as National Organising Secretary and Chief George Moghalu as National Auditor. The APC chairman in Enugu, Dr. Nwoye,  warned against the imposition of candidates on the zone by stakeholders from other zones, saying such development would cause disaffection and affect the re-election bid of President Muhammadu Buhari. He described any list produced at a meeting attended by a governor from the zone as a ‘Disunity List’, advising the National Convention Committee (NCC) to allow delegates to decide the winners. Nwoye said, “The six geo-political zones have positions zoned to them. We don’t go to those other zones and dictate who is produced there. The national chairman, for example, was zoned to South-south. We have people who are ably qualified to lead the party from the South-east. So, the concentration is you adapt people from your zone.”
