In a bid to ensure a peaceful Eid-Fitr celebration, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Kaduna State Command has deployed over 3,000 personnel to protect lives and properties in the state. While stating the command’s readiness to contend security challenges during and after the festivity, the Deputy Commandant of Corps, Aloysius Onyeama Nnegha said that the corps will ensure surveillance around worship centres, markets, recreational facilities and infrastructure in the state. “Regular patrols and pin down would be ensured to pave way for peaceful celebration,” he assured.  He called on members of the public to collaborate with NSCDC and other security agencies by ensuring timely report of any suspected person(s), acts and movements which are capable of posing security threats; he warned hoodlums and drug addicts to stave-off suspected black spots and desists from crime, particularly at this period.  He also warned criminals including kidnappers, armed robbers and gangsters like Yan-shara and Sarasuka among others to desist from their nefarious acts or face the wrath of the law; stressing that lawful measure will be taken to arrest and punish perpetrators of such dastard acts. “We will continue comb all flash points to prevent unlawful assemblies which result in crimes,” he said.  Nnegha urged parents and guardians to advise their wards to shun the company of unknown persons under the guise of celebration while he wished all Muslim faithful a hitch-free celebration.
