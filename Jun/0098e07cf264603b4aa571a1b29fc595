ActionAid-trained Women Peer-Education Facilitators in Kogi yesterday said their interventions have helped in addressing harmful traditional practices on widows and the girl-child and across 12 communities in the state. The facilitators disclosed this at a bi-annual meeting of the facilitators organized by ActionAid in collaboration with Participation Initiative for Behavioural Change in Development (PIBCID) in Lokoja. Mrs Enemi Alih from Ofuloko said her cycle had succeeded in reducing widows’ burdens by addressing some of the unwholesome traditional practices which the widows were hitherto subjected to. “Prior to the intervention,” she said, “they were subjected to six-month mourning period in addition to paying some levies before regaining their freedom.” She added that while the solitary confinement had been abolished, efforts were being made to reduce the period. Mrs One Awa from Ugbedemagwu lauded ActionAid for introducing the peer education which had promoted good parenting and enhanced the girl-child enrolment in schools in her community. According to Mrs Faith Mattaga from Osisi, through her cycle’s (group’s) sensitisation, some couples in her community had embraced child-spacing.
