A man accused of being a member of a far-right extremist group on Tuesday admitted buying a machete with the intention of killing an elected member of the British parliament. Jack Renshaw changed his plea to guilty ahead of the start of a trial at Londonâ€™s Old Bailey court involving himself and five other men accused of being members of the white supremacist neo-Nazi group National Action. The British government banned the group in 2016 following the murder of Jo Cox, a Member of Parliament (MP) from the opposition Labour Party, in a frenzied street attack by a Nazi-obsessed loner a week before a referendum on EU membership. The court heard that Renshaw had bought a machete with the intention of killing Rosie Cooper, another female Labour MP. Renshaw also admitted a charge of threatening another man with a view to his killing a woman, believing that the murder would take place. In the event, the crime did not happen. (NAN)
