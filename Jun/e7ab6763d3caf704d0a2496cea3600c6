The Nigerian Cancer Society has condemned the reduction in allocation for the establishment of chemotherapy centres in the 2018 budget. President of the society, Prof Sani Malami in a statement yesterday said it was shocking that the National Assembly reduced budgetary provision for health interventions. He said President Muhammadu Buhari in a recent speech had also confirmed that the funds, “Including money that had been earmarked for the establishment of chemotherapy centres were reduced by over N7.45 billion.” Prof Malami said it was unacceptable for such a critical and life-saving project to be compromised with the backdrop of increasing cancer cases in the country. “According to the most reliable estimates, 162,000 new cancer cases are diagnosed each year in Nigeria, and virtually all of these individuals succumb to the disease and face a painful and premature death within three to five years. This is the fate that awaits over half a million Nigerians presently living with various stages of cancers. A huge proportion of this tragedy could be mitigated once the proposed six regional chemotherapy centres are established and fully operational in each of the geopolitical zones,” he said. While saying that Nigeria has the lowest ratio of patient-to-chemotherapy machine even in sub-Saharan Africa, Malami called on President Buhari to table before the National Assembly a supplementary appropriation bill that would allocate funds for the chemotherapy centres. “We equally appeal to members of the National Assembly to expeditiously pass the supplementary budget to restore the establishment of the chemotherapy centres,” the society said.
