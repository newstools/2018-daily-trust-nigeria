The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, has urged Nigerians not to allow politicians divide them while canvassing for their votes. Addressing a crowd at his palace shortly after observing the Eid prayer at Fakon Idi, the sultan advised politicians to play politics with decorum, devoid of insults and incitement. He reiterated his call on the youth not to allow politicians use them for thuggery. “Don’t allow them to use you only to dump you after winning the elections. Whoever approaches you for thuggery ask him to lead you in the act,” he said. He advised Nigerians to avoid insulting their leaders, but continue to pray for them to lead successfully. He also urged Muslims to unite irrespective of their groups, while advising scholars to stick to the Qur’an and the hadith of the Holy Prophet in their dealings with followers. “There are some scholars that are misleading their followers for their selfish reasons which is against the teaching of the Holy Prophet. I am urging this kind of scholars to fear God,” he said. While wishing Muslim Ummah a peaceful celebration, he prayed Allah to reward all their good deeds with the paradise.
