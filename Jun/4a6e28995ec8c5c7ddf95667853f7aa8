The National Industrial Court in Abuja has given the management of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria seven days to show cause why the sum of N2.5 billion judgment debt will not be removed from source for sacked staff of the school. Justice Rakiya Haastrup yesterday also dismissed a preliminary objection by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) challenging the application by the ex-staff seeking the grant of Garnishee Order Nissi on the institution’s bank accounts with it. The apex bank had asked the court to strike out the application for want of the jurisdiction and competence to entertain it. The CBN’s objection by its counsel Ekokoiesua Urua on the grounds that the Attorney General of the Federation’s consent ought to be obtained before an account maintained by the bank could be garnished, was overruled by the court, which held that the apex bank is like a regular bank, not a government agency, in garnishee proceedings. The action followed the termination of 110 ABU workers in 1996 during the tenure of retired Major General Mamman Kotangora as Sole Administrator. The workers brought the claims in 2012 through their counsel, Femi Falana (SAN) following the failure of the institution to implement the white papers of the Visitation Panels constituted in 1999, 2004 and 2011, which had recommended their reinstatement and payment of entitlements. Justice P.O. Lifu of the court had in November, 2015 held that the purported termination of the claimants’ appointment, without due process, is null and void and of no effect. He therefore awarded the sum of N2.5bn computed emoluments within the period, which he said was subject to 10 percent interest per annum until totally cleared. The case has been adjourned to June 24 for hearing.
