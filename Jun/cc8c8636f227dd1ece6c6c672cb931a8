The disengaged workers of Kaduna Polytechnic have decried “delusive verification, gross underpayment of pension and gratuities” by the Accountant General’s office and the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD). Speaking on behalf of the severed staff, Babatunde Ipinyomi and Austin Umerah said the services of over 1,000 staff of the polytechnic were severed in February/May, 2008 under Consolidated Tertiary Institutions Salary Structure (CONTISS). According to the duo, the affected workers have for the past 10 years been denied their rights in terms of accurate gratuities and monthly pensions. The severed workers therefore demand urgent intervention, saying it is mortifying to receive half of one’s rightful entitlement amidst the economic situation of the country. Effort to reach PTAD failed but the pension desk officer of Kaduna Polytechnic, Shuaibu Abubakar said the list of the severed staffs has been taken to Abuja and that efforts were on to implement CONTISS for them as well as ensure payment of their arrears.
