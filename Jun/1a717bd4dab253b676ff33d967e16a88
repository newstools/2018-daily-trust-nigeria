The former chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Abubakar Jibrin Giri, has said that the defection of the incumbent chairman of the council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), did not follow due process. Giri stated this when he addressed newsmen after the party’s stakeholders meeting, which had the chapter chairman, Alhaji Hussein Deze, House of Representatives aspirant for Abuja South, Ahmad Abubakar Sadiq, and 10 ward chairmen as well as party executives in attendance at the party’s office in the area on Friday. He said neither him, being leader of APC, nor any of the local government executives was consulted about the defection of the incumbent chairman to the ruling APC in the area. He also said the council chairman violated the party’s constitution by defecting to the APC at the state level instead of ward level, saying he and other party stakeholders and the local government executives were not happy over the move. “We are not informed that the Gwagwalada chairman is defecting from APGA to APC and we are not happy over it, because he did not follow due process. Instead of him to defect at his ward, he went and defected at the state level, which is not proper,” he said. Also commenting on the issue, Reps aspirant Sadiq, said the FCT minister, Muhammed Bello Umar, violated the party’s constitution in handling the incumbent chairman’s decamping to the APC without following due process. “And whatever pressure that might led to violating the party’s constitution let it be addressed,” Sadiq said.
