The Alashe of Otta-Ikosi, Chief Oluwafemi, enjoined the  corporation to provide public fountains within the communities while pledging their support in sensitizing the people in their respective communities to pay water bills as and when due. He, however, implored the corporation’s management to be consistent in service delivery,  adding that there have been reported cases of burst pipes within the areas which he said should be promptly addressed. The Otta-Ikosi Production Manager,  Mr. Balogun Kamor, while taking the delegates round the LWC facilities, urged them to protect the project jealously, noting that potable water supply is part of the efforts of the State Government, through Lagos Water Corporation, to bring water to every home in the State.
