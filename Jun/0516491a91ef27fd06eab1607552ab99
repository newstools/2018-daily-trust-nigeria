Revenues for competing in the Champions League, Europa League and Uefa Super Cup will see a huge increase of £787m next season, Uefa have announced.

Last season, clubs were given a share of £2.06bn, but that figure has now jumped to £2.84bn.

However, Uefa said £457m will be deduced to pay for organisational costs and solidarity payments.

Real Madrid face city rivals Atletico Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup in August, which will be played in Estonia.

Real beat Liverpool 3-1 in the Champions League final, while Atletico defeated Marseille 3-0 to claim the Europa League title.

Both clubs will receive £3.06m for competing in the match, while the winner will collect an additional £870,000.
