The defeated Ekiti State governorship aspirant on the platform of the PDP, Senator Biodun Olujimi, has asked the national leadership of the party to give her automatic ticket for a second term in the senate as condition to work for Prof. Kolapo Olusola, the party’s candidate in the July 14 governorship election in the state. Senator Olujimi (Ekiti South) also requested the party to convene a reconciliatory meeting between her group and the PDP candidate who is also the deputy governor of the state. Olujimi had stepped down for a former Minister of Works, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, but Olusola defeated Adeyeye at the primary, prompting the latter to dump the PDP for APC. The lawmaker, in a letter dated May 30, 2018, and addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, also wants the party to allocate certain percentage of elective and appointive positions at the federal, state and local government levels to her as a condition for supporting Gov. Ayo Fayose’s preferred candidate.
