The Strategic Partnership Alliance for Lobbying and Advocacy, a coalition of civil society organizations has called on the Federal Government to increase the pace of work on the Ogoni cleanup project. The group is pushing for the full implementation of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report on Ogoni. The president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) Legborsi Saro Pyagbara stated this yesterday when he and some members of the group paid a courtesy visit to Daily Trust in Abuja. Pyagbara said they were alarmed at the slow pace of the implementation of UNEP report and feared that government may likely put it aside as election approaches. “This is a time to put pressure on government to move more speedily than the way they are moving at the moment, where we are now, many things are not yet done, 99  per cent of the report not implemented,” he said. He said the poison and pollution was expanding due to the slow rate of the implementation and that pollution could not remain stagnant.
