A Community Development Association, Jema’a Foundation, has commenced construction of Al’ummah Medical Centre worth N75.65 million in Kafanchan, Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The foundation’s National Chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Zubairu, who spoke during the foundation-laying ceremony of the project in Kafanchan yesterday, said it was the first of its kind in the area and intended to serve humanity in health care delivery. “The facility is for the benefit of all and sundry irrespective of religious or ethnic affiliation,” he said. Alhaji Zubairu noted that the success of the project was credited to the unity amongst members of the Association as well as cash contributions from well-meaning philanthropists within and outside Jema’a emirate. Also speaking, Alh. Bala Adamu, Head of the Project, said prior to the reconstruction of the project, the old structure had stayed uncompleted for over 20 years, adding, “We had to demolish the structure as it was already weak and giving way.” He said the centre has a 50-bed capacity including, theatre, laboratory, scanning and X-ray, amenity, male, female and paediatric wards. In a goodwill message, the Emir of Jema’a, Alhaji Muhammad Isa Muhammad, represented by Wakilin Gabas, Alhaji Ibrahim Cheche, applauded the Jema’a Foundation over the initiative and prayed for God’s blessings upon everyone who had contributed in diverse ways.
