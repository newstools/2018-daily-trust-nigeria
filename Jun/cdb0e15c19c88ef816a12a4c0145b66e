The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has written a letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) protesting alleged adoption of its ‘progress’ slogan by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at its recent national convention. In the letter dated June 25, 2018 and addressed to INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the party called on the electoral body not to approve the adoption of the slogan for the APC in the interest of peace, justice, and fairness. The letter signed by the SDP National Secretary, Alhaji Shehu Musa Gabam, read: “We kindly wish to bring to your attention the illegal adoption of our slogan of ‘progress’ in response to our shout of SDP by the APC at their recent convention in Abuja between June 22 and 23, 2018 at the Eagle Square. “You may please refer to your records which shows clearly that our constitution of 2010 amended 2012 and registered with INEC prior to the advent of APC contains our slogan in Article 5. Also, our recent NEC of May 30, 2018, at which INEC was in attendance, upheld our slogan in Article 5 Sub Section 5.1 of the 2018 amended SDP constitution. “It is therefore unacceptable that the APC be allowed to adopt our slogan with a long history of registration with INEC. “We, therefore, call on INEC not to approve the adoption of our slogan by the APC in the interest of peace, justice, fairness and in order not to confuse our supporters and the general public.” The letter was titled ‘Illegal Adoption of SDP Slogan of ‘Progress’ in Response to Shout of ‘SDP’ by APC’.
