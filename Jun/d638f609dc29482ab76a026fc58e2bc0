The Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi ll, has called on governors in the North to devise strategies that would stop  drug abuse among women and youths in the region. In his Sallah sermon, Sanusi lamented that the rate of drug abuse among youths and women in the region was alarming and the problem needs a holistic approach. He said, “It has been noticed that the children of those that are bringing drugs into the region are not into drugs. Rather, they are being sponsored abroad for studies with the profits their parents make from drug business. “I am calling on government at all levels to put heads together with wealthy individuals on the fight against drug abuse. The menace needs a holistic approach to address it. The future of the region lies on the upcoming generation and unless we save the situation, the future of northern Nigeria will be at stake,” he said. The emir thanked the federal government for banning importation and sale of cough syrups with codeine and the Kano State government for establishing a committee to fight the sale of the banned syrups.  He said governments had done their own part and the society should reciprocate.
