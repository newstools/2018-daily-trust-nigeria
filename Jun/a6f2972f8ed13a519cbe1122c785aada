A community leader and Aro of Iyin, in Iyin-Ekiti, Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Chief Wale Alade, yesterday lamented the state of traditional rulers, saying that majority of them are suffering and hungry as a result of salary non-payment of their salary by the state governor, Mr. Ayo Fayose. According to Alade, palace chiefs are being owed nine month arrears of salary while their monthly salary which used to be N1,800 under the administration of former Governor Kayode Fayemi, had been cut to N700 by the present government adding that lower grade palace chiefs received as low as N150 and N100 monthly. Speaking to newsmen in Iyin on Thursday, Alade described the alleged mal-treatment of Obas and chiefs by Fayose as “shameful and y annoying.” He recalled that that the traditional institution enjoyed better treatment under the tenure of Fayemi through regular payment of salaries, released of N450,000 security allowance to each community and special health mission for Obas, chiefs and their families. Responding to the allegation, the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Lanre Ogunsuyi, explained that the non-payment of salaries affect all segments of workers and public servants including political office holders in the state. He also attributed the problem to the debt burden inherited from the last administration. Alade said the July 14 governorship election offers the chiefs an opportunity to vote against Fayose and his anointed candidate, Prof. Kolapo The commissioner said the salaries of Obas and chiefs are being paid by the local government, so any number of months that is being owed others will affect them. “However, we take responsibility for anything that happens in Ekiti Local Government’s debt is even enormous like that of the state”, he said.
