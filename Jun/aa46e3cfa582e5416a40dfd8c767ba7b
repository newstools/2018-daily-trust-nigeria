President Muhammmadu Buhari says terrorism transcends international boundaries, and no country can fight it alone. Buhari, according to his spokesman, Femi Adesina, spoke in Katsina yesterday while receiving the president of Togo, Faure Gnassingbe. He lauded the proposal for a security summit of members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and countries in Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), slated for July 30. “We need to team up to fight common enemies. Terrorists in whatever form are enemies of humanity, and no effort must be spared to protect our people. I will always support anything that is meant to enhance security in our region,” Buhari said. President Gnassingbe said he was happy to be in Katsina, and thanked his host for his help in calming the political situation in Togo. He also briefed President Buhari on the Mali elections billed for next month, saying ECOWAS would ensure that everything went smoothly. Answering a question on what the sub-regional body could do to help Nigeria with the problem of clashes between cattle herders and farmers, the ECOWAS chairman said the problem was not peculiar to Nigeria, but common to a number of countries, including his own. “It is not a religious or ethnic problem and must not be misconceived as such. We will discuss the matter, and try to find a solution,” President Gnassingbe said. He also condoled President Buhari on the fire disaster caused by a fallen petrol tanker in Lagos Thursday.
