Plateau State government has established an emergency treatment centre for cholera at the old site of Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), following the death of three persons in the state as a result of the disease. The state Commissioner for Health, Kunden Kamshak Deyin, disclosed this in an interview with Daily Trust on phone in Jos yesterday. The commissioner said about 107 suspected cases were recorded in which three people died, adding that from the initial 93 suspected cases on Monday, the number has now increased to 107. Mr. Deyin explained the death of three people was due to non-availability of the Rapid Response Diagnostic Kits. He said, “We are telling people to keep their environment clean, to access clean drinking water and if they can’t access clean water they should boil their water before drinking it, we asked them to be washing their hands.”
