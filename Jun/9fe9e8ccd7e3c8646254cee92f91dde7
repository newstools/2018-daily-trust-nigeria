The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has accused the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of frustrating execution of projects in Taraba, Rivers and other states under the control of the party. Secondus in a statement yesterday by his Media Aide, Mr Ike Abonyi alleged that contractors were being harassed by officials of the commission in order to thwart execution of projects. “The recent harassment of contractors handling projects in only PDP states has clearly exposed the anti-graft agency as doing the bidding of the ruling party ahead of 2019. “Intelligence is available to the party that the ruling party and the Federal Government have resolved to ensure that PDP states are permanently put on their toes so as not to get their bearing ahead of 2019.
