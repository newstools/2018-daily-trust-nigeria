The Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, has sworn-in the clerk of the legislative arm, Alhaji Umar Ndagi, as the new Secretary of the Local Education Authority (LEA) of the council. Ajiya, while handing over the appointment letter to the new LEA secretary at a brief ceremony held at the council conference hall on Friday, could not hold his tears when he remembered the late LEA scribe, Alhaji Akilu Ramalan, who was his childhood friend. The chairman said the appointment of the new LEA scribe was to put an end to the grumbling over delay in the appointment of a substantive LEA secretary in the council. “I want us to understand that the delay in appointing a new LEA secretary was not deliberate.  God has chosen that a new LEA scribe should  emerge today so be it,” he said. Ajiya, therefore urged the new LEA secretary to see his appointment as a big challenge and ensure he discharged his duties diligently. Responding, Ndagi thanked the council chairman for appointing him as the new LEA secretary, while assuring that he would always do his best to transform primary education in the council. He also solicited for the support and cooperation of stakeholders in the area, urging them to always come up with useful advice that would benefit the primary education sector for children in the council.
