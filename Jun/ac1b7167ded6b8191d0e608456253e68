The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Edgal Imohimi yesterday blamed the increasing rate of drug abuse among underage persons to parental failure. Edgal said the rate at which youths are becoming addicted to illicit drugs has reached alarmingly state, adding that it  can only be addressed if parents pay more attention to their children. Speaking during a seminar organized by Crime Reporters Association of Nigeria (CRAN) themed: ‘Stop the Stigmatization of Ex-Drug Users and Human Trafficking’ to mark World Day Against Drug and Human Trafficking, he said four out of every 10 young persons will be involved in drug if nothing is done. Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, a rights activist, who was a guest lecturer at the event condemned outright the stigmatization on drug users saying that it makes the victim shy away from help. “Stigmatization is described as being bad or having a situation to be ashamed of. When you label a person or stigmatize, you make the society develop fear for the person, mistrust, violence, discrimination and so on.
