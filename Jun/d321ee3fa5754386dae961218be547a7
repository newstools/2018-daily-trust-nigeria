He had said 31 corpses were recovered from Gashish village while 41 others from 12 neighbouring villages of Barkin Ladi LG On its part, the Plateau State Government has condemned the attacks and sued for peace stressing that it had mobilised the full compliments of security forces to restore normalcy in the affected areas and the environs. A statement issued by the State Commissioner of Information and Communication, Yakubu Dati noted that “Government is deeply pained that despite concerted efforts which had led to the restoration of relative peace across the state, some unpatriotic elements are bent on disrupting the gains so far made.”
