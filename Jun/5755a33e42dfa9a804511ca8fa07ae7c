The Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) has said residents are exposed to increased stress levels, high blood pressure and decreased productivity in the work place due to the excesses of night club operators. The board which vowed to clamp down on erring night clubs, relaxation centres and gardens, said residents also risked sleeplessness, long term adverse effects on hearing and increased irritability due to uncontrolled noise from these places. The board’s Head of Information and Outreach Programme Unit, Mukhtar Ibrahim, in a statement, said noise generated by the clubs should not go beyond their immediate environment, insisting that clubs which would violate the guidelines for their operations would not be spared. “Following a barrage of complaints by residents and concerned stakeholders within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), violators of the Federal Capital Territory Laws Against Noise Pollution are reminded that they risk prosecution. “Operators of night clubs and social relaxation gardens in Abuja are therefore warned that AEPB would bring the full weight of the law to bear on noise pollutants in the territory,” he said. He said the law prohibited noise level above 75 decibels for day time and 50 decibels for night time for commercial areas; and 60 decibels for day time and 40 decibels for night time in residential areas.
