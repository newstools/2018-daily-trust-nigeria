The FCT Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), CC Wobin A. Gora, has said 1,400 regular marshals have been deployed to ensure free flow of traffic along the Abuja- Lokoja road as people travel home for the Eid el-fitr Sallah break. Gora, who addressed newsmen in his office, yesterday, also said over 1000 special marshals of the FRSC were assisting the regular marshals in the special patrol on the highways. He said the sector had, a week ago, prepared its operational order towards ensuring the roads were free of crashes as motorists conveyed travellers to their respective areas for the Sallah celebration. He said the sector had deployed the marshals to Gwagwalada, Nyanya, Zuba and Dutse Alhaji axis, which he said were the entry and exit points to the city of Abuja. “It is obvious that the government had declared Friday and Monday as public holiday and quite a number of people may take that advantage to travel home with their families and we will ensure that the roads record zero crashes,” he said. He, however said the sector had deployed ambulances at strategic places such as Abaji, Yangoji, Giri and Zuba, in case of crashes that may require emergency intervention. Gora added that ambulances had also been stationed at Gwarinpa, Keffi axis along Kugbo-Auta Balefi area, while others had been stationed along Federal Secretariat, Area 10 and at the City Gate. He said the corps would be thorough on reckless drivers who engaged in beating the traffic signs, saying any erring driver would be booked and fined, while urging motorists to obey traffic rules and regulations.
