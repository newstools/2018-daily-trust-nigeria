Rising floodwaters are hampering the search for 12 teenagers and their football coach who have been trapped in a cave in Thailand for four days. Heavy rainfall has caused water levels to rise faster than it can be drained by pumps, frustrating the efforts of hundreds of rescue workers. The main entrance is now impassable - prompting a search for some other way into the depths of the tunnel complex. There has been no contact with the group since Saturday. On Tuesday, navy divers reported seeing fresh footprints inside the cave complex, raising hopes for the groupâ€™s safety.
