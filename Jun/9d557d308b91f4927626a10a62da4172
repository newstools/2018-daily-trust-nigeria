Rukuba women and youths from Bassa local government area of Plateau State yesterday took to the streets, accusing the 3rd Armoured Division, Maxwell Khobe Cantonment popularly referred to as Rukuba barracks, of confiscating their lands. The protesters also accused the military of molesting their community members and blocking paths which had been in existence before the barrack was sited. Mrs Elizabeth Akson, who was one of the protesters, said the Nigerian Army had continued to encroach on farmlands owned by locals without compensation and stressed that they would continue to protest for their rights. As at the time of filing this report, the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General Benjamin Ahanotu, was said to have invited leaders of the Rukuba community for a meeting. However, the 3div Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, Col. Kayode Ogunsanya told Daily Trust that the allegations by the community was wrong, saying the locals have continued to encroach on the land owned by the Nigerian Army by farming on it. Col. Ogunsanya said those arrested for trying to force their way into the barracks had been released on the orders of the GOC.
