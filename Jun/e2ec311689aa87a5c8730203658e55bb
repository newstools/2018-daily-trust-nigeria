More parents still raise money to facilitate their childrenâ€™s migration to Libya in search of greener pastures, despite the massive repatriation of stranded Nigerians from North African country. The South-West Zonal Coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Alhaji Yakubu Suleiman, disclosed this while receiving fresh set of 171 returnees at the cargo terminal of Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos Tuesday night. Two batches of 186 returnees had arrived last week through the Assisted Voluntary Returnees programme of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) which has repatriated over 10,000 since 2016. The Buraq Airline flight conveying the returnees arrived at about 8:25pm with 70 female adults including nine pregnant women, 90 male adults, three children and eight infants. The voluntary returnees were brought from Zintan District of Libya with eight of them having minor health issues. The coordinator appealed to the returnees to be anti-trafficking champions to disabuse the minds of those still trying to embark on such journey.
