The president of Madagascar has named a new prime minister. Christian Ntsay - who has been working for the United Nations - was chosen just hours after the former prime minister resigned as part of an effort to end a political crisis. The 57-year-old is not a member of any political party, the AFP news agency reports. The agency quotes President Hery Rajaonarimampianina as saying, “I have named Christian Ntsay, an experienced man with the skills necessary for reconciliation, as prime minister.” The constitutional court had given the president until Tuesday to name a prime minister who would be acceptable to all political parties. According to the court ruling, Mr Ntsay should now form a government and organise elections within months. There have been fears of a political crisis in Madagascar after changes to electoral laws led to opposition demonstrations.
