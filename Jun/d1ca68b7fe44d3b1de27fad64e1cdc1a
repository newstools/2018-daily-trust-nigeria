The International Criminal Court (ICC) is to launch an assistance fund for victims in the Central African Republic (CAR) of a militia once run by the former Democratic Republic of Congo Vice-President, Jean-Pierre Bemba. The $1.2m fund comes after the release of Mr Bemba, whose conviction on war crimes charges was overturned by the court. In 2002, Mr Bemba sent his 1,500 strong militia into the CAR to suppress a coup. There his forces committed murder, rape and looting but appeal judges ruled he couldnâ€™t be held responsible for their crimes. The fund for victims in the CAR was first unveiled five years ago, but the ICC says it did not become operational because of the security situation.
