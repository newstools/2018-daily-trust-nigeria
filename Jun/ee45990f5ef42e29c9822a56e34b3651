The Bishop of Anglican Diocese of Kaduna, The Right Reverend Timothy Yahaya, has described the incessant killing of innocent Nigerians by suspected herdsmen as an act of terrorism that is becoming a holocaust. He spoke yesterday in an interview at the first session of the 21st Synod of the Anglican Communion. Reacting to the recent killings in Plateau, he said successful attacks on villages, particularly in the day time showed that the security architecture of the country was faulty. He demanded that the killer herdsmen be declared terrorists, adding, “In Nigeria, we talk with many sides of the mouth. We proscribed Biafra and called them terrorists, go and dig the facts and tell me how many people they killed and how much damage they have done to the country that the Fulani herdsmen have not overtaken.” “These people are agitating that they are being marginalized, what are the killer herdsmen agitating for? Since the last four years, there has been a dramatic twist on the wave, dynamics and sophistication of insecurity in Nigeria. Insecurity which used to be one of the lowest concerns in the hierarchy of Nigeria’s social problems has now assumed an alarming proportion,” The way forward according to him is a leadership that is pragmatic, sincere and ready to deliver justice. “For the incident that happened in Plateau state, the GOC, Commissioner of Police, DPO and everyone in the hierarchy that was supposed to stop the killings but allowed it happen should be sacked. “Also, if the service chiefs had shame, value for life and if they had honour and dignity, they would resign, this is what civilized people do,” he said.
