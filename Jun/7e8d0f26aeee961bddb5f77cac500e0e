A Non-Governmental Organisation, Women At Risk International Foundation (WARIF), has raised an alarm that the result of a recent survey it conducted revealed that one out of every four girls in Lagos State suffers from sexual abuse. He WARIF Founder and Managing Director, Anita Dasliva-Ibru, who made the revelation in Lagos also said in another survey conducted among boys in the city, one out of every eight boys has experienced rape or any other of form of sexual abuse. Dasliva-Ibru said the staggering discoveries have prodded her NGO to launch awareness campaigns on how girls can protect themselves against sexual abuse especially for Secondary School girls within the age range of 12 and 17. “However, we discovered that over the years, many awareness campaigns by us and other NGO and bodies have always centered on girls or female students. It appears the society is leaving the boys behind in the menace that is fast growing in our society. But unknown to many, these boys also suffer sexual abuse of different forms and the most pathetic is that since society seem to be careless about their cases, many of them do grow into the same condemnable habit they were once victims,”Dasliva-Ibru said. According to the WARIF Founder, the worrisome development necessitated the group to conduct a focus group survey in February 2018 among teenage boys between the ages of 13 and 16 years who are in Senior Secondary School. “The results confirmed that: one in five boys will choose to walk away rather than intervene and assist when a girl is being harassed; 81 per cent of teenage boys believe that a rape survivor is responsible for the abuse because her mode of dressing; 52 per cent of boys are of the opinion that a pornographic/ sexualized images are contributing factors to why boys rape and one in three boys believed that the ability to define normal relationship is negatively influenced by the media – radio, television and social.
