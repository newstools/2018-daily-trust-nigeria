The Chairman of the Peoples Democritic Party (PDP) in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Mahmud Mohammed, has called on political leaders in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to provide dividends of democracy to the people if they want to be re-elected. Mohammed said political office holders would be bolder to campaign for re-election if they had impacted positively on the lives of the electorate. He added that PDP had delivered the dividends of democracy to the residents and that that was why it was still the party to beat. “If the people see that they are working for their wellbeing, they will be bold to re-elect them. I am convinced that if PDP comes back in 2019, we will give more to the people of the FCT,” he said. Mohammed, who made this call while assessing projects executed by present and past political office holders in  the territory, said FCT residents had benefitted immensely from projects executed by past and present PDP leaders in the territory. Mohammed who led the team of AMAC PDP executives on the tour said he was impressed by the kind of project carried out by Sen. Phillip Aduda, urging residents to always support him. “We have gone round the FCT and I must confess that we are impressed with what our leaders and representatives have been doing in terms of projects implementation,” he said.
