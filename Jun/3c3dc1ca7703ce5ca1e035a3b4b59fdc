The Vice Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, Professor Ibrahim Garba, has urged Nigerians to always tolerate, accommodate and embrace one another in order to promote national cohesion. He made the call at the university’s National Agricultural Extension and Liaisons Services (NAERLS) Suite weekend during an iftar (breaking of the fast) the suite organised to honour the VC, journalists and other Muslims that relate with the institution. He said; “ABU is a true reflection of a mini Nigeria. Therefore, the call for tolerance has become necessary in view of the cosmopolitan nature of the university. For our Christian friends that grace this occasion, we thank you for honouring our invitation and sharing this moment with us. “ABU is not a monogynous family; ABU is polygamous. It means in this spirit, we need to continue to live together, share our good moments and even our sorrows. Again, we should continue to pray for ourselves and the country, because that’s what is keeping us.”
