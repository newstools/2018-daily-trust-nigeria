The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) through its 207 Quick Response Group (QRG) in Gusau, has rescued 3 persons held captive for weeks. The troops executed coordinated air and ground operations on armed bandits’ position at Daji Kagara area of Zurmi LGA in Zamfara State. A statement by NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya said the mission was conducted by Special Forces personnel. He said the operation followed human intelligence reports and subsequent confirmation, by NAF Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, of the hideout of the armed bandits. The recently deployed EC-135 helicopter and one of the NAF’s ISR platforms provided the needed air support for the Special Forces to execute the rescue mission. It may be recalled that the NAF recently deployed a weaponized EC-135 helicopter to 207 QRG Gusau as part of efforts aimed at intensifying the fight against armed banditry in Zamfara State and environs. More coordinated air and ground operations would be executed in the coming weeks towards improving the security situation in the state, the statement said.
