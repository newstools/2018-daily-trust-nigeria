The Federal Government says it has spent over 9billion dollars on the building of infrastructure since the beginning of the Buhari administration. The Minister of Information and Culture,  Lai Mohammed stated this during a press briefing in Abuja yesterday to herald the 61st Meeting of the UNWTO-CAF, which begins today and run through Wednesday, June 6, 2018. He said the increased infrastructural development across the country has improved the rate of foreign investors coming into the country saying 166 foreign delegates, 26 ministers and 332 Nigerian delegates have confirmed attendance at the confab. Alhaji Mohammed said the infrastructural development has led to Nigeria’s ranking as the 24th globally on ease of doing business, especially with the visa processes which has been made easier for investors. While noting the theme of the United Nation World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) Regional Commission for Africa meeting: “Tourism Statistics: A Catalyst for Development’’, Alhaji Mohammed said the theme fits very well into Nigeria’s quest to improve on her  tourism statistics for planning purposes and the ultimate development of the sector. The minister said Nigeria would showcase its rich cultural heritage and various tourism locations during the global event. Secretary General of the UNWTO, Mr Zurab Pololikashvili said the aim of hosting the event in Nigeria is to promote the country and Africa to the rest of the World. “The Abuja meeting will ratify an action plan on tourism in Africa. We believe that the future of Africa is in tourism because it has the potential to create jobs,” he said. Pololikashvili said government must also ensure the provision of critical infrastructure because “tourism cannot thrive without infrastructure and that is one of the advantages.”
