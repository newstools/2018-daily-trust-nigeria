A Kuje Upper Area Court, FCT, has sentenced a 28-year-old mechanic, Ahmed Abubakar, to four months imprisonment for stealing electric cables valued at N80,000. The Judge, Malam Abdullahi Abdulkareem, sentenced Abubakar with no option of fine after he pleaded guilty. The convict, who resides at Anguwan Gade, was arraigned on a three-count charge of criminal trespass, mischief and theft. The Prosecutor, Doris Okoroba, had told the court that the offence was committed on June 2. Okoroba said one Reuben Timothy, a security man attached to Enal Primary School, Kuje, reported the crime at the Kuje Police Station on the same date. She said the convict entered an uncompleted building very close to the school and stole the electric cables. When the charges were read to Abubakar, he pleaded guilty. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Sections 342, 326 and 287 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
