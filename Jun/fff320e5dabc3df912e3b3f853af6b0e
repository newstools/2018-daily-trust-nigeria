Troops of the 21-Brigade supported by members of the Civilian Joint Task Force deployed to the Operation Lafiya Dole in the North East have rescued 148 civilians, including 58 women that had been used as sex slaves by the Boko Haram. Army spokesman at the Theatre Command in Maiduguri, Col. Onyema Nwachukwu, said this in a statement yesterday. “The troops rescued the hostages during an extensive Clearance Operation on Sunday, to rid the general area of Bama, Modu Kimeri and Gulumba Gana of fleeing elements of Boko Haram terrorists who had escaped from the ongoing troops’ onslaught in the Lake Chad Islands and fringes of the northern borders of the state,” he said. Col. Nwachukwu explained thus: “The rescued hostages, comprising 15 men, 58 women and 75 children revealed during a joint profiling and interrogations by troops of operation Lafiya Dole and other security agencies, that the Boko Haram terrorists had sexually violated the females. Two pregnant teenage girls are among the rescued persons,” he said.
