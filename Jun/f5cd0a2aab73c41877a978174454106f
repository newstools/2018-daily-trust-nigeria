The Coordinator of the Satellite Towns Development Agency (STDA), Ishaku Tanko Yamawo, has said synergy between stakeholders and the agency will address the issue of indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the territory and its satellite towns. Yamawo, who spoke in an interview with our reporter yesterday, urged traditional rulers in the FCT to join hands to halt indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the satellite towns. He said though the STDA had a task force to address the situation, but said the communities also had a role to play as the task force might not be everywhere, especially in the nooks and crannies of the towns. The coordinator, however, warned residents to desist from dumping refuse in water channels and drains, which he said could cause flooding. He said many residents kept their refuse and waited on rains for them to empty them in drains, which he said was unacceptable. “I warn that the residents should avoid dumping of refuse in water channels, these are the things that are causing flooding in some areas, but you will find that some Nigerians will sweep their houses and keep the waste, waiting for rain to fall so that they can empty them in drains, which is not good,” he said. The coordinator called on area council officials to support the effort of the STDA in evacuating refuse in the interior villages beyond the reach of the department.
