The Dutch city of Amsterdam has chosen former political leader Femke Halsema to be its mayor, the first woman to be given the role in its history. While most big cities in the Netherlands have had women mayors, the capital in common with Rotterdam has never been led by a woman. A member of the left-wing green party Groenlinks, Ms Halsema said she was “happy, proud and humbled” by the nomination. Amsterdam had its first mayor in 1343. The nomination of Ms Halsema, 52, by the left-led city council, has to be ratified by the government and signed by the king but that is seen as a formality.
