Experts have called for attitudinal change in tackling drug abuse in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The experts who spoke at the launch of a book, “Free Bondage” by Nevan Bello, said education was essential in discouraging youths from substance abuse. An emotional intelligence expert, Priscilla Banta, said all hope was not lost, as through increased education and sensitisation, the menace would be drastically reduced; if not eradicated. Banta said the high rate of drug abuse was connected to the prevailing denial of the menace or its victims and therefore, urged caregivers of victims of substance abuse to seek continuous knowledge and skills on the management of the menace as it was a dynamic scourge. She urged people suffering from depression or emotional breakdown to always seek help from experts, trusted friends and religious leaders. The author, Pharm. Nevan Bello, said the book was her contribution to tackling the menace of drug abuse, as education remained critical to discouraging people, especially youths, from indulging in the scourge. Pharm. Bello decried the involvement of security agents, as well as prominent personalities in abusing drugs and other substances, and advocated for attitudinal change to effectively reverse the ugly trend. The book reviewer, Ms. Na’anchin Mohammed, commended the author for writing a book on drug abuse, describing it as handy and apt in tackling the menace.
