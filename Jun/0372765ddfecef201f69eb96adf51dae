A Non-Government Organization (NGO) has disclosed plans to rehabilitate 200 drug addicts in Kaduna to help them live a meaningful life. The founder of Life Challenge Intervention Outreach, Mr. Ejikeme McBishop Ogueji, said this at a sensitization programme to mark this yearâ€™s International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Kanti Aga, a suburb of Kaduna known to be a black spot of drug addicts. According to him, some of the drug addicts who have been rehabilitated by the organization are currently serving in the Nigerian Army, Navy and Air Force among others. Ogueji however urged government at all levels to handle the issue of drug abuse among youths with all the seriousness it deserves.
