Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly made a decision on his future amid interest from Manchester United.

According to Don Balon, Neymar is in regular contact with Real president Florentino Perez, with the Spaniards keen to sign the Brazilian this summer.

The PSG star is only interested in a return to La Liga if Ronaldo is sold and he has been given reassurances that Ronaldo will not be at the Bernabeu next season.

Don Balon claim that Neymar has relayed this information to former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi.

Ronaldo is reportedly keen on the move as he believes teams in the Premier League are tactically inferior, meaning he will be able to stand out even more.
