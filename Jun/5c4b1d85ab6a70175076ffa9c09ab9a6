Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has said that there were no reasons for him to regret the enactment of the state’s open grazing prohibition and ranches establishment law of 2017. Ortom made the disclosure to journalists in Makurdi where he also said that the state lost over N400bn worth of property to renewed herdsmen attacks on Benue communities since 2015. He said the estimated figure was arrived at based on preliminary report of assessment of damages caused by the crisis. “Why should I have any regret doing the will of my people? They trusted me and gave me their votes and I will not betray what they want. I’m doing what they want and I’ve no regret,” he said. The governor commended his colleagues from Ekiti, Taraba and Abia states for keying into the ranching law, adding that it was the right way to go.
