The Kaduna State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) has released the list of successful applicants for the just concluded second batch recruitment examination for teaching appointment into the state’s public primary schools. Kaduna State Government had in April deployed 11,395 newly recruited teachers to over 4,000 public primary schools in the 23 local government areas of the state. The 11,395 teachers were those who succeeded in the first phase recruitment exercise of teachers to replace the over 21,000 teachers that were sacked last year for their inability to pass the competency test conducted by government.  It would be recalled that the state government last year sacked 21,780 teachers who failed a test conducted to test their competency, which prompted it to begin to shop for 25,000 new and qualified teachers to replace those that failed. The second phase of the recruitment exercise for over 19,000 candidates had since begun.  The executive chairman of SUBEB, Nasiru Umar advised the applicants to check their names in their respective local government areas of residence while he noted that oral interview and appraisal will begin from 2nd – 7th July, 2018 at the 23 local government education authorities while those from other states will be interviewed at SUBEB headquarters from 9th – 11th July, 2018. He also urged them to come along with two recent passport photographs, original and photocopies of their credentials.
