The wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been charged with fraud relating to the alleged misuse of state funds. Sara Netanyahu is charged with misusing 359,000 shekels ($100,000; £77,000) for catering services at the prime minister’s official residence. She is also charged with a breach of trust following a police inquiry, the justice ministry says. Mrs Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing. Her lawyers described the indictment as absurd and delusional. On Thursday, she was charged along with Ezra Seidoff, a former deputy director general of the prime minister’s office.
