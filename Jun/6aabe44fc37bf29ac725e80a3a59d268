The Igbara-Odo 70’s Development Forum (IDF), Ekiti State, on Monday, donated educational materials worth millions of naira to students of the community. The IDF said the gesture was aimed at assisting talented young ones but financially disadvantaged in their educational pursuit. The materials donated to the students include dictionaries, text books on different subjects for both JSS and SSS and classes. According to the  group’s chairman, Mr. Lucas Afere,  the programme was initiated to encourage the younger generation in their personal development and for the progress  of the community. “We equally notice that the standard of education has seriously fallen nowadays, partly as a result of the lackadaisical attitude of our students towards their studies.  What we are presenting today is a product of our personal sacrifices and contributions as a result of our burning desire to see a better and brighter Igbara-Odo society, this is to also acknowledge our pacesetters, the Igbara-Odo Development Forum 60’s, (IDF 60’s) whose contributions have indeed propelled the (IDF 70’s) to this action,” he said. Afere, commended the traditional ruler of the community, Oba Edward Jayeola,  whose reign has witnessed tremendous transformation of the town. The educational materials were distributed to over 500 students of the community. The Arajaka of Igbara-Odo Ekiti, His Royal Majesty, Oba Edward Jayeola, appreciated the group for remembering their home town and extending hands of fellowship to the younger ones, and following the kind gesture of the IDF 60’s set. Oba Jayeola, called on well-meaning sons and daughters of the community to remember to give back to their root from whatever God has blessed them with  for the betterment of the youths and the development of the community at large.
