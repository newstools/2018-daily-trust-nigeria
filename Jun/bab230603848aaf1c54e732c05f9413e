The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, has subsidised 70 metric tonnes of fertiliser for rural farmers by 50 percent. Adamu, who spoke to our reporter, yesterday, said a bag of fertiliser would be sold for N3,500 as against the market price of N7,000. He said the council had also subsidised farm inputs such as rice seedlings, agro chemicals, sprayers and maize seedlings for farmers. The chairman said the distribution channel of the fertilisers to the farmers would be through the councillors and traditional rulers. Also speaking, a House of Representatives member for Abuja South, Alhaji Zakari Angulu Dobi, commended the council chairman for giving priority to rural farmers in theÂ  council. He therefore warned against selling the fertiliser to middle men who would in turn sell the subsidized commodity at a high rate, thereby denying the targeted rural farmers from accessing it.
