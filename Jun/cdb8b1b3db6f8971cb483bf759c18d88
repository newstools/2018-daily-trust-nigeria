The Chief Justice of the Federation (CJN), Walter S. N. Onnoghen, has said that there may be anarchy in the country unless governments at all level learn to obey court orders and rule of law. Onnoghen gave the warning as the guest lecturer at the first University of Lagos (UNILAG) Faculty of Law public lecture at the varsity’s main campus, Akoka, Lagos. The CJN spoke in a 17-page speech titled “The Rule of Law as Panacea for Peace, Security and Good Governance.” “Any government that is against the enthronement of the rule of law is by implication inviting anarchy into the system. A democratic government must not only obey the law but also courts’ orders,” Onnoghen said. The CJN said “I have said it before and I am saying it again that if given four years of adherence to the rule of law, Nigeria can change. The problem of insecurity, killings, among others will become a thing of the past. “But rather than confronting our fears which is how to satisfy the minority groups, we keep creating states and local governments yet the fear remains. But if the rule of law is to be put in place, the minority groups will know that even if they are to be violated, they can go to court and get justice.” The Pro-Chancellor and Chairman, UNILAG Governing Council, Dr Wale Babalakin, SAN said political office holders must learn to respect the rule of law whether in the ruling or opposition party. “Some politicians while in opposition, they will emphasize the rule of law but they will capitulate when they get there,” he said
