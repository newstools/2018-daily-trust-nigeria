Former world number one Novak Djokovic reached his first final for a year by beating Jeremy Chardy at the Fever-Tree Championships at Queen’s. The Serb, who was hampered by an elbow injury last year, won the semi-final against the Frenchman 7-6 (7-5) 6-4. Djokovic looked skywards after sealing victory with a powerful forehand. He will face top seed Marin Cilic in Sunday’s final at the grass-court event after the Croat kept his cool to beat Nick Kyrgios 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4). Djokovic’s last appearance in a Tour final was at Eastbourne a year ago, where the 12-time Grand Slam champion went on to win the title. He accepted a wildcard to this year’s Queen’s in an attempt to regain his best form before Wimbledon, which starts on 2 July.
