Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly already chosen his squad number at Manchester United.

According to Don Balon, a Spanish outlet, Ronaldo has demanded the famous No.7 shirt.

The 33-year-old wore the number for six years before moving to the Bernabeu in 2009.

It’s currently occupied by Alexis Sanchez following his arrival from Arsenal in January.

And Don Balon claim that Mourinho has warned the Chilean that if Ronaldo signs then he must give up the shirt.

The report suggests that if Sanchez refuses then he’ll be forced to look for a new club.

The Real Madrid winger has hinted he could leave the Bernabeu this summer.
