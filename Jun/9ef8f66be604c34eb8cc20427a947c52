Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has unveiled plans by his administration to speed up regular training for civil servants with a target to drive up the urban renewal programmes in the state. Ambode made the disclosure in Lagos at a training programme tagged; “Re-Charting the Path to Quality: The Sustainable Road to the Change Mantra.” Represented by the Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Dr Akintola Benson-Oke, Ambode said going forward; his administration has resolved to inject more funds into training and re-training of civil servants, monitor progress being recorded from time to time, ensure regular deployment of modern technology in the training and re-training of staff and most importantly, ensure that the trainings have direct bearings on the administration’s achievements. “The on-going training has been designed by the Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions, as approved to knit together all the factors and knowledge nuggets that will ensure that this administration’s change mantra indeed births the desired concrete for the civil service. Today, as the state trudges on with remarkable successes in every sector, especially the urban renewal projects that have become the flagship of our success stories,” he said. According to the governor, if the Lagos State civil service must deliver quality, it must be able to harness existing talents, nurture them and place officers in positions where they can be most successful.
