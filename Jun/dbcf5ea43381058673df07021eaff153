Traditional rulers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have held a closed door meeting in Abaji ostensibly to deliberate on the crisis in Bwari Area Council. City News gathered that the meeting held at the palace of the Ona of Abaji, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, had in attendance the Chief of Rubochi, Alhaji Muhammad Ibrahim Pada, Agabe of Gwargwada-Ugbada, Alhaji Hussein Agabi Mam and Chief of Gwomani, Alhaji Adamu Saba. Other traditional rulers at the meeting were the Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo; Chief of Pai, Alhaji Abdullahi Bala; Chief of Karu, Emmanuel Yepwi; Chief of Garki, Alhaji Usman Ngakupi’i and other traditional rulers. A source at the meeting confided in our reporter that the traditional rulers discussed extensively on the lingering crisis in Bwari town. One of the traditional rulers that attended the meeting, who also spoke with our reporter on condition of anonymity, said they decided to hold the meeting in order to have one voice so that the  two Bwari traditional rulers and their supporters should see the need for both of them to embrace peace. “The acting director of the FCT Chieftaincy Matters was also at the meeting, but we have unanimously resolved to meet the  two traditional rulers in Bwari, where the council chairman, Musa Dikko, will also be in attendance to finalise how peace should reign in Bwari on Wednesday this week,” he said.
