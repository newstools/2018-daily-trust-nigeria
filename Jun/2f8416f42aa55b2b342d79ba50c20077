A Yola High Court has sentenced five persons to death by hanging for the murder of a herdsman in Demsa Local Government of Adamawa State. Justice Abdul-Azeez Waziri ruled that Alex Amos, Alheri Phanuel, Holy Boniface, Jerry Gideon and Jari Sabagi of Demsa LG were found guilty of criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide. Waziri held that the prosecution counsel Barrister Salihu Muhammad has proved the case against the five convicts beyond reasonable doubt. He said the offence had contravened section 96 (1) (a) and sections 79 and 221 (b) of the penal code. “I hereby sentenced the accused persons on counts one and two to death by hanging, while on counts four and five I sentenced the accused to three years in prison to run concurrently. “Any aggrieved party is at liberty to file an appeal to the Court of Appeal Yola Judicial Division within 90 days from today,” the judge said. The convicts had attacked three herdsmen on 18/1/17 in Kadamun village where they killed one of their victims, Adamu Buba, threw his body into a river and injured several cows.
