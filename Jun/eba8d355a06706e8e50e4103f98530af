The Federal Government is to disburse loans to over 4,000 beneficiaries of the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme, (GEEP) in Edo State. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo disclosed this yesterday in Benin at the state’s edition of Micro, Small and Medium-Scale Enterprise (MSME) Clinic. GEEP is one of the National Social Intervention Programmes (NSIP) of the current administration, providing interest-loans of between N10,000 and N100,000 to market women, farmers, artisans and enterprising youths nationwide under the Bank of Industry. He said “the policy of the Federal Government is to support businesses, not just big businesses but particularly small, medium-sized businesses and micro-businesses. The whole idea is that we want to ensure that we give whatever support whether it is cash, advice or even registration to all of our small and medium enterprises.” Osinbajo said “apart from the existing GEEP MarketMoni scheme, which targets market women, traders, artisans and enterprising youths, the Federal Government is rolling out TraderMoni, a new micro-credit scheme to cater for ultra-micro enterprises. He said the programme is a different from MarketMoni because TraderMoni is for the smaller traders like, hawkers whose wares are sometimes not worth more than N5,000 to N10,000. Also speaking,  GEEP MarketMoni scheme, the Executive Director of Financial Inclusion in BOI, Toyin Adeniji, said though the federal government  has done over 4,000 loans in Edo state and 350,000 nationwide,  the pilot phase of the TraderMoni scheme already began, with 368 traders in Edo State who were given N10,000 each after the event.
