An APC national chairmanship aspirant and former governor of Cross River State, Chief Clement Ebri, has withdrawn from the race. Ebri had joined Chief Ibrahim Emokpaire, a former governor of Edo State, Prof. Oserheimen Osunbor who had earlier withdrawn from the contest. With this development, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has been left as the sole aspirant for the contest on Saturday. Ebri said the decision was taken in the overall interest of the party, adding that such decision was necessary to avoid rancor as the 2019 general elections approached. Meanwhile, the secretary of the National Convention Committee (NCC), Sen. Victor Ndoma-Egba, has said that there would be  contest tomorrow. Ndoma-Egba, who fielded questions yesterday, said the party was reviewing all the court cases that arose from the parallel congresses. On the report that delegates from some states would not be accepted due to court cases, he said, “I am sure a clear position will emerge this night.”
