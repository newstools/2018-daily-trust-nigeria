Nigerian youths have been charged to explore the abundant existing opportunities in the country and be of good ambassadors wherever they find themselves to sustain Nigeria’s enviable position in Africa and the world. The convener of the Project One ‎Production (PoP), a non- governmental organisation (NGO), Mrs Abisayo Busari Akinnadeju, gave this charge in Abuja. She told the youths that they are not average rated, but the best. Speaking at the just concluded “I AM A NIGERIAN Conference 2018”, she said that Nigeria is youths and that they must do the very best they can to ensure that both the country and the citizenry are proud people. “I want you to know the fundamental thing concerning yourself and where many Nigerians would think twice to leave and become citizens of another country. Project One Production is here for that one Nigerian, who will go on in this country and build sublime lives for him or herself,” Akinnadeju said. Also, in her paper presentation titled ‘Breeding a new generation without greed’, the team lead ‎of Servicom, Mrs Ladi Daniella Aku, said that the greatest challenge facing government and policy makers in Africa today is how to provide opportunities and meet the needs of young people. She however advised the youths to make a difference and be proud of the country, urging them to shun negative vices and peer pressure. She said, “Seek ways to develop and empower yourselves and know that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. As youths, we must therefore be Vanguard of change and at the same time be change that we wish to see. We must all work together towards the actualisation ‎of sustainable peace and harmony to build an enduring legacy.”
