The  Nigeria Prisons Service (NPS) has constituted a committee to investigate  the remote and immediate causes of the jail break at theÂ  Minna New Prison in Niger State on Sunday night. The  Control-General of the NPS, Ja'afaru Ahmed disclosed this while  addressing senior officers of the Service at an emergency meeting in  Abuja on Thursday. He said 55 of the 210 escaped prisoners have been recaptured.

Ahmed  also said the NPS was doing everything possible to recapture others who were still at large.

"Even  though the attack is external, I still feel it is incumbent on us as  managers of men and materials to re-assess ourselves with a view to  ensuring that our primary mandate of safe and humane custody of inmates  at all times is guaranteed", he enjoined the officers.

While  noting that the NPS had its challenges, the Control-General said the  government was already working towards improving the organisation for  maximum output.

"The  issue of manpower shortage is being addressed with the ongoing  recruitment of more personnel into the Service", adding that he will  continue to impress on the government on the imperative for more  personnel and funds to the Service.

He charged the senior officers to reciprocate the gesture of the government by discharging their duties at all times.

It  would be recalled that some unidentified gunmen stormed the Minna New  Prison last Sunday night, exchanged fire with Armed Squad personnel on  duty before overpowering them and forcefully opening the gate to release  the inmates.

The invaders also shot and killed a staff who was coming for duty and the motorcycle rider that conveyed him.
