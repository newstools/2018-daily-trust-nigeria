The first high-level Eritrean delegation to visit Ethiopia in decades has arrived for a meeting which could ease military tension. Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year conflict - but a border war five years later killed tens of thousands. Diplomatic ties have been cut between the two countries for almost 20 years. Last week, Ethiopiaâ€™s prime minister said he would accept a peace deal awarding Eritrea disputed territory. The deal, agreed by a border commission in 2002, had never formally been accepted by Ethiopia. It is just one of a series of reforms Abiy Ahmed, who became prime minister after his predecessor resigned in February, has enacted since he took power. On Sunday, a political rally he attended was hit by a grenade blast which killed two people and injured dozens, though Mr Ahmed was uninjured.
