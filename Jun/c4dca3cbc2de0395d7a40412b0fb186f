A Lagos High Court has sentenced one Inyang Kingsley to a life imprisonment for allegedly defining a 12-year-old girl. Kingsley was convicted on a one count charge of defilement which is contrary to section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. Justice Sedonten Ogunsanya of the Lagos High Court who handed down the sentence said it is the punishment prescribed by the law. The court had earlier upheld the argument of the prosecution, led by the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Lagos State, Adeniji Kazeem. The court also observed several inconsistencies in the testimonies of four defense witnesses, including the evidence given by the defendant. During the trial, the defense counsel to Inyang, Mr. Hassan Fajimite, had pleaded with the court to tamper justice with mercy because he is a young man who came to Lagos to fend for a daily livelihood, but the plea was rejected by the court in the final sentencing. It will be recalled that Inyang, a church member with the victimâ€™s parents in July 2015, at No 16 Adetunde Arogundade Street, Iju Ishaga, was accused of having carnal knowledge of the 12-year old girl, who was sent by her parents to call on him to attend a House Fellowship programme at the said address, But Inyang, instead, lured the girl into his room and defiled her with a warning that she should not tell anybody about it. In a statement after the court judgment, Kazeem expressed satisfaction with the judgment.
