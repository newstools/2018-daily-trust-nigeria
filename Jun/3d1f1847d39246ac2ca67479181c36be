A Federal High Court in Kaduna has ordered that the former governor of Kaduna State, Mukhtar Ramalan Yero, and three others be remanded in prison custody, pending the determination of a bail application. Yero was charged with the former Kaduna State chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Abubakar Gaya Haruna, former secretary to the state government, Hamza Ishaq and former minister, Nuhu Somo Wya. They were arraigned on a three-count-charge for conspiring and receiving the sum of N700 million being proceeds of an illegal activity. They were also charged for allegedly receiving money from one Donald Abimaye without passing through a financial institution thereby committing an offence contrary to Section 1(a) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act. Counsel to Yero, Yunus Uztaz, had applied that his client be admitted on bail. But the judge said he cannot hear an oral application and gave the defendants time to file a formal application. Lead prosecutor of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC), Joshua Saidi, said the EFCC does not have enough facility to remand the defendants. Justice Mohammed Shuaib adjourned the matter for hearing to Wednesday June 6.
