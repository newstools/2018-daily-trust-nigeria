The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has called on the Federal Government to caution the Adamawa Government against hasty implementation of the death sentence passed on five Christian youths. Rev. Samson Ayokunle, CAN president, made this call in a statement signed by Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, Special Assistant, Media and Communications to the CAN President, yesterday in Abuja. Ayokunle said the five convicts were alleged to have on June 1, 2017, ‘wilfully and intentionally conspired and attacked three herdsmen rearing cattle, at Kadamun village in Demsa Local Government Area’. He said that the convicts killed one of the herdsmen, Adamu Buba, whose body was thrown into a river they also maimed several cows. According to him, Justice Abdul-Azeez Waziri of a High Court in the state recently sentenced the convicts to death for culpable homicide. “The names of the convict are Alex Amos, Alheri Phanuel, Holy Boniface, Jerry Gideon and Jari Sabagi. “CAN is not supporting jungle justice or any criminality. “But hundreds of our members in Southern Kaduna, Benue, Taraba, Plateau states in the North-central geo-political zones, and a state like Enugu in the South, have been killed. “Some criminals parading themselves as Fulani herdsmen are still killing our members on a daily basis, but are yet to be apprehended.” Ayokunle, however, said despite the outrage that has trailed the killings of Christians in Nigeria, it was disheartened that none of the killers has been brought to justice. “In view of this, CAN is calling on President Buhari to intervene in the death sentence passed on these Christian youths in Adamawa,” he said.
