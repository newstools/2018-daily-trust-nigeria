The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has congratulated all Muslim workers and the Nigerian Muslim community for successfully concluding the holy month of Ramadan, while it urged them to fully imbibe the virtues of Eid-el-fitr. The president of the congress, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, in a statement described the Eid-el-fitr as a very important event in the life of every Muslim chiefly because of the virtues it embodies. “Eid-el-fitr teaches denial, dedication, discipline and diligence. It also teaches a time of stock taking as Muslims use the period of the Ramadan fasting to take an objective assessment of their areas of strength and weakness. The strengths are consolidated while the weaknesses are strengthened,” According to him, in the midst of harrowing general inflation, Nigerian workers have soldiered on in self-denial, dedication and diligence as partners in the onerous mission of nation building. He added that the government could make workers’ load lighter by quickly approving the demand of organized labour for a new national minimum wage.
