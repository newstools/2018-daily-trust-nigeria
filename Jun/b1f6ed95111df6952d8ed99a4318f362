Troops of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS) have captured three members of a notorious gang headed by Benue’s most wanted kingpin, Terwase Akwaza, popularly known as Gana. The Force Commander of OPWS, Major General Adeyemi Mutiu Yekini, yesterday at a press conference in Makurdi said the troops, following a tipoff in the early hours of Saturday, bombarded the camp of the militia leader at Ayaka in Kastina Ala area during which Gana and his armed men were dislodged. Yekini, who said the assault on the camp was preceded by aerial bombardment by the Air Force helicopter, explained further that two members of the gang were captured first while the third gang member was arrested in Taraba State by the 93 Battalion. “The third gang member arrested in Taraba State has already confessed to killing the former security adviser to Governor Samuel Ortom,” he said. He added that by the second day of the operation which was Sunday, troops who mopped up operations around camp Ayaka in search of Gana within 40 Kilometre radius of the vicinity recovered 10 magazines of AK47 rifles including one gun, one pistol and seven 7.62mm, 9mm special ammunition earlier recovered. He said at about 5pm on Sunday, Mi35 helicopter noticed some men loitering at the destroyed Ayaka camp after troops had withdrawn which prompted the air component to attack and neutralised the men. Yekini said spirited efforts were being made presently to ascertain the current status and whereabouts of Gana in order to bring him to justice. The notorious kingpin is being linked to the killing of one of Governor Ortom’s aide, Denen Igbana, in May 2016 among other crimes.
