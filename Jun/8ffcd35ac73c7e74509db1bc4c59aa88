President Muhammmadu Buhari has condoled with the government and people of Bauchi State over the windstorm disaster "on the heels of which the market in Azare was razed by a mysterious fire." The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement late Monday night, quoted Buhari as saying that the government and people of Nigeria stood with the state as it struggled to manage the fallout of the double tragedy. He said President Buhari extended deepest sympathies to the victims and families of devastating windstorm and the fire incidents. â€œNigerians stand in solidarity with their fellow countrymen in this difficult time as they face the devastation with courage and fortitude. "As a fellow human being, I understand your pains and inconveniences as you struggle to pick up the pieces and rebuild your lost houses, schools, markets and places of worship. This is not something you bargained and we are powerless against the fury of nature", the President stressed "On behalf of myself and my administration, my heart goes out to the victims of this disaster and I pray to God to replenish their losses", Buhari was quoted to have said.
