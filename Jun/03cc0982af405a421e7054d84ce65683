Playback Nigeria is organizing the first ever Childrenâ€™s Theatre Festival in Nigeria, from Wednesday June 27 in Abuja in partnership with the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, (NAPPS) FCT Chapter. Playback Nigeria is an art-based organization dedicated to using interactive arts for psychosocial support, community interaction, enhancement, development, education and capacity building. It said the platform will give young people to use their creative skills as a tool for advocacy, bringing to the fore, issues children are faced with, through theatre and drama. The four day event will offer a platform for young people ages 7 to 18 to express themselves by participating and witnessing 40 creative art performances. Each performance provides an opportunity for performers and over 5000 spectators to explore their concerns as young children through art. Original performances are being put together by individual performers and 20 school groups including Glisten International School, Bankys Private School, and Stella Maris College.
