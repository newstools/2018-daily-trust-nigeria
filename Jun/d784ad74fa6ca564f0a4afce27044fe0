Many passengers, yesterday, struggled for flight tickets at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, to travel for the Eid al-Fitr celebration as few domestic airlines were operating optimally. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that there was traffic upsurge at the domestic terminal of the airport on Thursday morning, especially at the Terminal D, where Air Peace operates from. Some of the passengers were seen struggling to secure seats to Lagos, Kano and Port Harcourt, which according to them, were not available. Mr. William Audu told NAN that he could not get available seat through online booking so he decided to go to the airport to see if he could secure any available seat on any flight. Audu, a Lagos-bound passenger, told NAN that First Nation and Med-View airlines were not operating. He said some airline officials promised to help him secure a seat at a high cost, but he declined to disclose  at what amount. An airport official told NAN that only Air Peace had full flight schedule with the highest number of flights, as well as aircraft. He said First Nation had not scheduled any flight for close to two months, while Med-View’s last flight operation was on June 8. The official further said other domestic airlines such as Azman, Aero, Arik and Dana were also operating with fewer aircraft, adding that some of their aircraft were on maintenance check. Azman, he said, was operating with only two of its four-fleet aircraft on Abuja, Lagos and Kano routes as one was deployed for Hajj operation, while the fourth was on routine maintenance check. (NAN)
