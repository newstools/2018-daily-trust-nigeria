Following the recent violence leading to killings in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State, the ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) has urged the Federal Government to promptly find a lasting and realistic solution that will promote peaceful coexistence and greater productivity in the country.  Speaking on the incident that led to the death of over 86 persons in Plateau State, the Country Director, AAN, Ene Obi said the crisis escalated because of the failure of the state to pro-actively take steps to confront the evident causes of the conflict, thus endangering lives and properties. “We are concerned that if this continues, civilians, especially young people might wield arms and put the nation in a total state of insecurity,” Obi said. She however commended the prompt visit by the Presidency. She said that previous attacks have been reportedly carried out in the night but that this was different; with the killings done in broad day light making it more worrisome, apart from the claim by the State Police Commissioner, Undie Adie on a national television that the Police could not respond in time due to the distance between the metropolis and the community. “Undie’s explanation further reveals the level of inequality in the country as it indicates that only the rich and urban population have access to security. Good road network and a reliable community-based security infrastructure could have saved the lives of the people. “As an organisation driven by the core value of justice and equity, we believe that all citizens have inalienable rights to co-exist peacefully as they engage in economic activities without hindrance, “We demand that justice be served to bring killers to book no matter which side of the divide they belong, as this will serve as deterrent and remind all parties that there is no reward for criminality. “While we acknowledge the efforts of the security forces, who appear to be overwhelmed by the security crises in the country, we will like to remind government to uphold its key constitutional responsibility of protecting the lives and properties of the citizenry,” she said.
