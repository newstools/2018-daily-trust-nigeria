Senators burst into laughter when the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, mentioned the word “transmission” while reading a letter from President Muhammadu Buhari. The mentioning of the word was trailed by thunderous laughter by senators present at the chamber, and overwhelmed by the laughter, Saraki paused and said, “Let me take it again.” Yesterday’s drama happened weeks after a short video of the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, tagged “Transmission” went viral on the social media. Saraki and the IG had been at loggerheads over issues surrounding the indictment of the senate president by suspects in police custody.  It was alleged that the IG had endlessly tried to pronounce “transmission” correctly at a function in Kano until he was aided, even as some analysts said that portion of the video was doctored out of mischief. After the laughter, Saraki read the president’s letter titled: “Transmission of the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Amendment Bill 2018”. Buhari’s letter read, “I forward herewith a draft Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Amendment Bill 2018 for the kind consideration and passage by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, “While hoping that the bill will receive the usual expeditious consideration and passage by the distinguished senate.”
