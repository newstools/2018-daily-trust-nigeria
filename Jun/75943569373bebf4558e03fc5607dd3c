President Muhammadu Buhari jokingly said the ruling party,All Progressives Congress (APC) would 'abduct' the Senate Deputy Minority Leader, Bala Ibn Allah, from the opposition People's Democratic Party. Buhari, who expressed delight at the turnout for the homage, jokingly said that perhaps for the 2019 elections, the ruling All Progressives Congress would try and "abduct" the Senate Deputy Minority Leader, Bala Ibn Allah, who was among his visitors, from the opposition People's Democratic Party. The president said Ibn Allah seemed to be enjoying at the Senate so much  that he was "putting on weight by the day." Noting that Nigeria was blessed with human and material resources, Buhari said: "I’m very pleased that we are working very hard collectively as Nigerians and that God in his infinite mercy who knows what is in the heart and not by mouth, will continue to guide us so that we accommodate each other at all times."
