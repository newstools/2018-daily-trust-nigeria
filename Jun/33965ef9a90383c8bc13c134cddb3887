The Surulere area of Lagos metropolis is set to receive a boost in power supply as Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC), the distribution company responsible for supply of power in the area, has announced plans to build a new distribution injection sub-station of 2 x 2.5MVA bulk transformer capacity in the area. According to the company’s General Manager, Corporate Communications, Mr. Godwin Idemudia, the site for the project, located at Mechanic Village, off Randle Avenue, was donated to the company by Lagos State government through the state Ministry of Transport. While thanking the state government for the good gesture, Mr. Idemudia said the new power project would lead to tremendous turnaround in power supply in Surulere and environs as four new 11kv feeders would be created from the new substation. The four 11kv feeders, he said would relieve some already overloaded feeders that have resulted in power rationing and intermittent outage in the area. Describing the new project as one of the gains of collaboration and partnership between the company and Lagos State government, Idemudia expressed gratitude to the state government for making the land available for the project adding that the company was looking forward to more of such mutually beneficial collaborations in future. While reiterating the company’s commitment to customer satisfaction and optimal service delivery at all times, the Eko Disco spokesman further disclosed that more power improvement projects have been lined up for execution in different parts of the company’s operational territory in Lagos State.
