A court in Israel has convicted a 19-year-old American-Israeli man of making hundreds of threats to bomb or attack Jewish schools and community centres. Michael Ron David Kadar was also found guilty of extortion, money laundering and assaulting a police officer. He used the internet to make hoax telephone calls to the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The threats forced evacuations and prompted concern among Jewish leaders about a resurgence of anti-Semitism.
