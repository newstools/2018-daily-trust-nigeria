Some stakeholders in the Enugu State judiciary sector have expressed concern over the attitude of law enforcement agents and the ministry of justice to the implementation of the Administration of Criminal Justice (ACJ) Act 2015. The Act was passed to ensure that criminal cases and suspects were handled with ‘human face’. They emphasized that except such concerned institutions sit up and do the right thing, the purpose of passing the Act would not be actualised. The stakeholders’ meeting on review of the ACJ Act implementation in the state was organized by the CLEEN Foundation and supported by the MacArthur Foundation, in Enugu. Acting Chief Registrar, Enugu State High Court, Martha Aroh-Onuoha who addressed the gathering, weekend, said the “police is not ready” in the implementation of the Act, and appealed to the NGOs that have things to do with justice reforms to make sure they addressed that aspect. Also, the Enugu State secretary of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Joy Gbanigo described the ACJ Act as a “blessing to all of us, Nigerians,” but stressed the need for capacity building, monitoring and effective implementation of the Act in the 22 states and the FCT  that have domesticated it. She called on the Chief Judge of Enugu State to embark on a monthly visitation to prisons for the release of those who were thrown into jail for minor offences.
