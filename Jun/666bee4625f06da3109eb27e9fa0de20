The government of Nasarawa State yesterday donated N10 million to victims of Saturday’s attack that claimed over 200 persons in some communities of Barkin Ladi LGA of Plateau State. Governor Umaru Tanko Almakura who arrived the Little Rayfield Government House with traditional rulers from the state on a condolence visit to the government and people of Plateau State condemned the attack, describing it as reprehensible and unacceptable. “We know that the burden of this challenge is so overwhelming on you and the government of Plateau State, we as your neighbours would also come to your support and assistance no matter how little with the donation of N10 million,” he said. Governor Lalong thanked the government and people of Nasarawa State, saying, “In every state, when you have good people you also have pockets of bad people which lead to the killing of innocent lives. Whoever has done this and thinks he has escaped, he has not escaped before God, one day God will expose them.” The governor also said those who think they are above the law would be made to face the law, adding, “I have told the people of Plateau State to be patient and cooperate with us, we will unveil those behind this crisis.”
