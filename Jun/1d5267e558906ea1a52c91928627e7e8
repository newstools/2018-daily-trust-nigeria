The National Assembly on Tuesday asked President Muhammadu Buhari to be sincere about the fight against corruption and stop the prosecution of perceived opponents. Rising from a joint closed-door sitting of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, the lawmakers said the president should also stop the harassment and intimidation of members of the National Assembly.

Reading the 11 resolutions reached at the closed-door session, Senate President Bukola Saraki said security agencies must be given matching orders to contain and curtail the killings of all Nigerians.

Also, the lawmakers said there must be strict adherence to the rule of law and that the president must be held accountable for the activities of his appointees

They said those that invaded the Senate and stole its mace should be prosecuted and that government officials indicted of corruption should be prosecuted.

President must take immediate steps to contain the growing unemployment in the country, they said.

While passing a vote of confidence on the Senate President and Speaker Yakubu Dogara, they lawmakers reaffirmed their earlier position on vote of no confidence on the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris.

They said if all the resolutions are not adhered to, they would not hesitate to exercise their powers.
