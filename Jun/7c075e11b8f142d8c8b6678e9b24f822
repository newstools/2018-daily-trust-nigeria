President Muhammadu Buhari has urged all universities in the country to stamp out all forms of academic and financial corruption, social vices and sexual harassment which continue to tarnish the reputation of Nigeria’s citadels of learning.

In an address read by his representative, the Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Professor Rasheed Abubakar, President Buhari said all the universities must also demonstrate commitment to the core values of honesty, integrity transparency and the rule of law in order to play any major role in Nigeria’s social, economic, political and cultural transformation.
