As part of events to celebrate the International Widows’ Day, members of Soroptimist International, Gwarinpa have donated items to some widows in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The club’s president, Helen Okeleka-Adesanya, while making the donation on Saturday, urged the widows to redress their perception about poverty. “The problem with the widows is that they are poor in heart. Their poverty is not that they have nothing but poverty of mentality, perception and the way they think and limit themselves and they should change their perception,” she said. Okeleka-Adesanya who also used the event to celebrate her 50th birthday, called on government to formulate policies that would tackle the challenges of widows and elderly people in the society as done in other countries. She said she chose to celebrate her birthday with the widows in order to give them hope and put smiles on their faces. “I chose the widows because of the need to put smiles on their faces and give them hope which is what my club is mandated to do; so that they will know that there still are people who care and love them,” she added. One of the beneficiaries, Yunus Daniel, said she was excited with the gifts and prayed for the celebrant and the club. “She has put smiles on our faces by giving us food, clothes and other things. It will help us maybe some of us don’t have rice at home, like this mama that is given wheelchair, she can now move around better,” she said.
