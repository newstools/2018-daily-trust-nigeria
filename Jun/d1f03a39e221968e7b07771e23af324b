The FCT Secondary Education Board (SEB) has embarked on training of teachers on Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the six area councils. Head of ICT of the board, Alhaji Jiya Madami, who represented the board’s Chairman, Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, while declaring the training workshop open yesterday in Abuja, said the FCT could not be left behind in the ICT drive. Alh. Muhammad said improving teachers’ quality in ICT was among his eight-point agenda. He said there was the need for schools to live up to expectation in the teaching and learning process. Muhammad said the ICT training was being anchored by a team of facilitators on networking, web design, computer appreciation, computer trouble shooting and advanced Microsoft excel for data base creation. He stated that ICT was a vital part of advancing teachers’ knowledge in the present day technology drive, saying every activity was based on it for effectiveness and efficiency. He urged the teachers to be focused and impact their students and schools through effective application of topics taught. Also speaking, leader of the facilitators, Dr. China Ukwe, said there was the need to further conduct learning needs assessment in future in order to determine the level of ICT awareness by the teachers and that there should be a follow up training by the board.
