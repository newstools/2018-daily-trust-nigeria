Former governor of Kano State, Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, said that the need to avoid friction was responsible for his decision not to attend the APC National Convention. Kwankwaso, who reacted yesterday in his twitter handle @KwankwasoRM, however, congratulated new APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, and other newly elected party officials. The tweet read, “The APC group in Kano which I am opportuned to lead will like to congratulate and felicitate with the newly elected Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and his newly elected exco. “I wish to inform the leadership and the general public that we had wanted to be part of the convention but regrettably all the congresses that we conducted at the wards, local governments and State level were not recognized by the outgoing National exco. “Therefore, I felt that presenting ourselves at such an important event will not be in the overall interest of the entire convention that is assuming we are allowed access into the convention ground. “Because there are high chances our presence could create embarrassments and friction similar or even worse than what occurred in Imo and Delta States pavilion during the convention. However, as the new exco settle to start the efforts of uniting the party, we wish them the very best.”
