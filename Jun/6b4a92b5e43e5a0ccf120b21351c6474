An explosion in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar has killed at least 18 people and left another 30 wounded. Sunday’s explosion took place outside the regional governor’s office and comes just a day after a suicide bomber killed at least 36 people at an Eid gathering in the province. Those killed in that explosion included civilians, government forces and Taliban fighters. No group has claimed responsibility for Sunday’s explosion but Saturday’s was claimed by the local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group. The militants said there would be no extension to the ceasefire and fighters would be expected to leave government-controlled areas before sunset. “The ceasefire ends tonight and our operations will begin, God willing. We have no intention to extend the ceasefire,” said spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. The Taliban said their ceasefire had been to enable ordinary Afghans to enjoy a peaceful Eid, and not to please the government.
