The Wife of the President, Aisha Muhammmadu Buhari, has described the contributions of missions and development partners in Nigeria as significant, urging them to do more. She spoke at the Banquet Hall of the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja Sunday night while breaking Ramadan fast with wives of Heads of Missions in Nigeria and Development Partners. “I remember when wives of Heads of Mission built boreholes to provide water in three IDP camps across the country, contributions like these reassure of the humanity in us,” Mrs Buhari said. The Wife of the Vice President, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo, said, “I believe we all have the same desires, especially now during fasting. It’s therefore time to turn our attention to the things that we really desire as women - our families; we need to pray for health and progress.” UN Women Country Representative, Mrs Comfort Lamptey, who spoke on behalf of Development Partners, was full of praises for the wife of the President over her Future Assured Programme, which she said was improving the lives of women and children in Nigeria.
