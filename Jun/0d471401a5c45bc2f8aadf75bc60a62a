The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, has formally defected from the opposition All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Alhaji Adamu was received yesterday by the FCT Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Abdulmalik Usman, at the party’s secretariat in Abuja. The event was witnessed by the chairmen of Abaji and Kuje area councils, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya and Abdullahi D. Galadima  respectively, as well as other party stalwarts. The APC chairman, while presenting the party’s membership card to Mustapha, said his defection was yet another history-making day for the APC  and that it was a sign that it would  conquer the six area councils of the FCT in the 2019 general elections. “I will like to cast your minds back to when we started this party in 2014. We had only one area council. In the 2015 elections, we had only one National Assembly member, but today, we have two National Assembly members,”  he said. He added that, “We have the president, what remains for us, and by the power of God in 2019, the FCT senator shall emerge from the APC.” Responding, Adamu Mustapha said he was glad to pitch his tent with the ruling APC, saying the party was transparent  and that President Muhammadu Buhari had brought sanity to governance. “And that has been equally transmitted to us at the local level by the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, which I feel obliged to join the team, and together, we can build the nation,” he said. On his part, House of Representatives Member (Abuja South), Alhaji Zakari Angulu Dobi, said there was need for aggrieved party members to forgive one another, saying the most important thing was to see that the party remained intact ahead of the 2019 elections.
