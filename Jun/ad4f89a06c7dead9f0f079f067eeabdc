Red Bull’s Max Verstappen headed Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen in second practice at the Canadian Grand Prix. Verstappen’s team-mate Daniel Ricciardo leapt up to third place late on after electrical problems delayed him. But Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes appeared to be quickest, fourth and 0.579 seconds off the pace on a slower tyre. The session was characterised by teams juggling tyres to work out their best strategy for qualifying and race with the awkward hyper-soft rubber. The hyper-soft is much faster over one lap than the ultra-soft, the medium of three compounds this weekend, but it degrades much faster than other two, and at least some of the top three teams are likely to try to avoid starting the race on it.
