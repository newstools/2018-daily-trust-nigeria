The FCT Secondary Education Board (SEB) has organised a workshop for 62 senior secondary school principals and vice principals as well as divisional heads of the board. Speaking at the workshop, the SEB board chairman, Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, represented by Alhaji Sani Store, said the training was to equip the school administrators with the requisite knowledge for the task of proper and effective management of schools. He said the importance of the workshop lied in the fact that  education was one of the key elements in nation building, stressing that high productivity was achieved through training and retraining of the workforce. He added that the training workshop was a fallout of the board’s inspection of over 30 senior secondary schools across the FCT since the board chairman assumed office. He said the dilapidated state school facilities and the uncomfortable learning environment were a serious cause for concern, while calling on school administrators to utilize the opportunity offered to them for training to impact positively on their students. Also speaking, the principal of Government Secondary School (GSS) Kubwa, Musa Nuhu Zuru, expressed delight that the workshop would improve the management capacity of school administrators across the FCT. He promised to intensify efforts to ensure that all he had learned would be implemented to make learning interesting for the students. The training workshop with theme ‘Developing an Effective School Leadership for Continuous School Improvement’, focused on the need for school transformation and good communication skill.
