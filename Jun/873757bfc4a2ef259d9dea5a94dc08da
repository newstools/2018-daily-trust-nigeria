The Presidency has slammed the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for declaring seven-day mourning over recent killings in Plateau State, saying the party was playing ‘cheap and infantile’ politics. Presidential spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, in a statement yesterday, accused the PDP of shedding crocodile tears. “The sad and unfortunate killings in Plateau State over the weekend have been turned to opportunity to once again play irresponsible politics, particularly by the PDP, which says it is declaring seven days of mourning. “These are dolorous times that call for deep introspection on how cheap human lives have become, and the proffering of actionable ideas on how to get out of the bind. But the PDP would rather dance on the graves of the dead, playing cheap, infantile politics,” he said. Adesina provided what he called a quick checklist of some killings in during PDP rule, between 1999 and 2015, for which no national mourning was declared. He said those taking pleasure in twisting statements from the Presidency might claim the presidency was saying that many more people were killed under PDP than under President Muhammadu Buhari, stressing that “It would be unconscionable to do so”. He said this statement was intended to show that “Wanton killings had been with us for awhile; this government is working towards enduring solutions; and should be given the opportunity to do so.”
