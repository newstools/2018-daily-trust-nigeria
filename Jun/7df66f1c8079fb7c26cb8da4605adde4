The Plateau State Governor Rt. Hon. Simon Bako Lalong has condemned in very strong terms the protest organized by some group of people over the recent attacks in the Northern Senatorial District which turned violent. In a statement signed by Director, Press & Public Affairs, Samuel, Emmanuel Nanle, the governor said that it was regrettable that the conveners of the protest under the joint auspices of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Northern Zone of Plateau State; the Youth Wing of Christian Association of Nigeria (YOWICAN), Plateau State and Bazata Gospel Team allowed the protest to be hijacked by hoodlums. Lalong added that the hoodlums took advantage of the procession led by these organizations to destroy government’s properties, vehicles of Civil Servants and visitors to the Government House running into millions of Naira. He noted that the protest represents one of the saddest commentaries in the state’s collective resolve to stand as a people united against evil. Governor Lalong opined that the name of the Church as a moral rectitude shouldn’t have been associated in any way with group of persons who would contemplate violence as a show of discontent especially in this period that all Godly and peace loving citizens are sharing in the grief of the bereaved. He said, “What is more worrisome about the protest is that protesters weren’t willing to listen to the voice of reason in allowing the governor attend to visiting Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki and the former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, who were on a condolence visit to the state ahead of his addressing them.” He added that while government mourns the loss of innocent lives and has extended deep commiseration to victims of the unfortunate attacks; his administration wouldn’t rest on its oath in fishing out the perpetrators. He said, “We wouldn’t fold our hands and watch disgruntled citizens throw the state into a state of anarchy and chaos under the guise of mourning.”
