The authorities of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife have dismissed Professor Richard Akindele, a senior lecturer in the Department of Accounting, for gross misconduct after he was found liable for sex-for-mark scandal with a student Miss Monica Osagie. The Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Eyitope Ogunbodede, said in a press statement yesterday that the Joint Committee of Council and Senate of the university that probed the allegation against the professor recommended his dismissal. The VC said the professor conducted himself in an inappropriate relationship with Monica as established through their recorded audio conversations. Ogunbodede said the lecturer acted in a manner that is seen to have compromised his position as a teacher and examiner given the manner he was negotiating with Monica about examination scores and inducement of favour for the alteration of examination scores. “He offered to change Miss Osagie’s purported 33% result to a pass mark in consideration for sexual favours, this was established in the audio recording which he admitted,” the statement said. It added that “His claim that Miss Osagie knew that she had passed with a score of 45% but was seeking to score an A and that this led to him being sexually harassed by Miss Monica cannot be supported by any evidence.” The statement added that Professor Akindele’s action in requesting sexual favour from Osagie to change her examination score tarnished the reputation of the university, “as it portrays the university as an institution where its teachers and examiners trade mark for sex”. Professor Ogunbodede said OAU is fully committed to the eradication of sexual and any other forms of harassment from the institution.
