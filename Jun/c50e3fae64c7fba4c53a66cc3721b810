He wrote: “On behalf of my family, the Federal Executive Council and good people of Nigeria, I write to felicitate with you on the occasion of your 80th birthday.

 

‘‘Our nation is immensely grateful to the Almighty God for giving you the opportunity to see this special day, particularly in reminiscence of your contributions and sacrifices for the country’s development.

 

“As a nation, we are thankful as we reflect on the many appointments you have held over the years, at home and abroad, with remarkable dedication to duty which still serves as a signpost and inspiration for our youths.

 

“On this auspicious occasion of your turning into an octogenarian, be assured that the nation still counts on your wise counsel, patriotism and devotion to the service of humanity to move forward.’’

 

President Buhari prayed that Almighty God grant Aduwo longer life and strength.
