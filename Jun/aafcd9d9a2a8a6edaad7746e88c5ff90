The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, yesterday formally announced his withdrawal from the chairmanship race ahead of June 23, 2018 national convention of the party, gave  reasons for his decision. Recall that Daily Trust had earlier exclusively reported his decision not to contest the position again after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. Chief Odigie-Oyegun said the decision taken was in the best interest of the party since all critical stakeholders in the leadership would be required to bind together because of the difficult days ahead. “I have consulted widely with my family, friends and associates. Even though I had the desire to re-contest as the national chairman of the party, l have decided that it is ultimately in the best interest of the party for me to withdraw from the race. “I have taken this decision without prejudice to my commitment to the party in helping to solve some of the subsisting and emerging difficult issues and my ability to continue to provide necessary leadership. However, I believe that the party faces difficult days ahead, and all critical stakeholders in its leadership would be required to bind together for a common purpose. Therefore, the less contentious our national convention is, the better for the party. “I have always sought to be part of solving the problem of the APC, I do not intend to be a part of the problems. It is for this reason that I hereby declare that I will not be seeking re-election as the national chairman of the APC.” Oyegun thanked those who stood by him, especially members of the party who mobilised support for him even before declaring interest. He urged them to continue to give similar support to whoever emerges.
