The Sultan of Sokoto Alhaji Sa'ad Abububakar has called on Nigerians to enroll for the National Identification Number (NIN). He made the call during a joint courtesy visit by the Director General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Engr. Aliyu Aziz and the Director General, National Orientation Agency (NOA), Dr Garba Abari to the Sultan to brief him on the ongoing collaboration between NIMC and NOA to sensitize Nigerians and legal residents especially at the grassroots on NIN enrollment, it's benefits, importance and the National Identity Management System (NIMS). Speaking during the event, Engr. Aziz informed the Sultan of the need to populate the national database to be able to manage individual’s identity as against card issuance which was the previous narrative, as the world is moving towards digital identity, like the US social security number, the UK social insurance number and the Indian Adhar. Aziz also emphasized the commission’s commitment towards populating the National Identity Database with all citizens and legal residents including children. In his response, the Sultan commended NIMC and NOA for taking the initiative to collaborate in order to achieve success. He pledged to drive the message down to his subjects, and further assured the team of his support towards ensuring the success of the exercise, as it will be of immense benefit to not only the people of Sokoto state but the entire nation.
