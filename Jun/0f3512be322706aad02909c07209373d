Members of the Plateau State House of Assembly have failed to extend the tenure of the local government transition committee chairmen which elapsed yesterday. The Speaker of the House of Assembly, Hon. Peter Azi, also escaped impeachment when he tried to evade a discussion on the issue of tenure extension or dissolution of the LG chairmen. The action of the speaker prompted some members to begin collecting signatures for his impeachment but the paper was snatched by a member who tore it to pieces. At plenary, Daniel Mikang (Mikang Constituency) moved a motion for the dissolution of the chairmen which was supported by Simon Kudu (Bassa Constituency). However, the Majority Leader, Henry Yunkwap, sought for extension and was supported by Hon. Ibrahim Baba Hassan (Jos North). When the Speaker however called for votes 18 lawmakers voted in favour of the dissolution, one person voted against it and another person abstained. After the seating, some lawmakers went into an emergency meeting while others were said to have left for Government House to deliberate with Governor Simon Bako Lalong. Daily Trust reports that the chairmen were appointed in July 2017 and have had their tenure extended consistently before they were dissolved yesterday. Their previous tenure extension was a fall out of the postponement of local government elections.
