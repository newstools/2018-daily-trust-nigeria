The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has written to the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Samuel Onnoghen, seeking for the transfer of the trial of former Kano State Governor, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau out of the Kano. At the trial yesterday, counsel to the EFCC, Mr Jonson Ojogbane, said, “After we left the court during the last sitting, we found ourselves in a very difficult situation before we move out of this court. Even at our office, we could not leave our office until after we released Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, the 1st defendant. “Our witnesses have expressed fear and apprehension that they will not be comfortable appearing before this court to testify. My lord it is based on this ground that we sent a letter dated 1st June, 2018, to the Chief Justice of Nigeria seeking for the transfer of this trial out of Kano, which in our view would be safer for the parties in this case.” Mr Ojogbane therefore applied for adjournment of the case to enable him continues with the processes of transfer of the prosecution out of Kano State. Objecting the application, counsel to Ambassador Aminu Wali and Alhaji Mansur Ahmed (2nd and 3rd defendants), Mr Jibrin S. Okutepa, said, “The EFCC is asking for the transfer of the case without minding the interest of other parties in the case. In my view, my lord, the prosecution is not ready to continue with trial and that is why the commission wanted to delay the trial.” In her ruling on the adjournment application, the presiding judge, Zainab B. Abubakar, adjourned the case till October 18, 2018. Daily Trust observed that the session was held under heavy security as over 40 police patrol vans with armed policemen were stationed around the court.
