Protests in Jordan against tax rises and austerity measures - the biggest demonstrations in years - continued for a third consecutive night. Police fired tear gas and blocked roads in the capital Amman to stop protesters getting close to the cabinet office. The protesters say a new tax bill backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will hurt the poor and middle class. King Abdullah has called for compromise from all sides. Several thousand protesters chanting anti-government slogans and calling for King Abdullah to dismiss Prime Minister Hani Mulki have been holding vigils near the cabinet office. There have also been some protests in provincial towns, where police have reportedly used tear gas. In the southern town of Maan protesters burned tyres on highways and there were scuffles with police, Reuters reported. Jordanians have seen prices rise with salaries failing to keep up. On Friday King Abdullah intervened to freeze an increase in fuel prices.
