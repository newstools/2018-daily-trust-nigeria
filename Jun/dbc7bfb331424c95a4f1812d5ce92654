The Borno Elders Forum (BEF), yesterday, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his courage in redefining all the narratives about the June 12 imbroglio. A statement by chairman of the forum, Ambassador Usman Gaji Galtimari, said Buhari deserved mention for the historic recognition of June 12. “On behalf of members of the Borno Elders Forum, I wish to extend our sincere appreciation and commendation to His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, Commander in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria, for his decision on the sanctity of the June 12th, 1993 elections which since then remained as one of the most delicate issues in the nation’s history. “By this decision, the matter is not only put to rest but it also goes a long way to confirm the democratic disposition of the administration. “While we congratulate all those who struggled for the actualization of June 12th, we further wish to commend the president for bestowing national honours on late Chief MKO Abiola, his running-mate Ambassador B.G. Kingibe as well as late Chief Gani Fawehinmi,” the statement said. The Borno Elders Forum, has always been and will ever remain grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for his doggedness in establishing peace and security in Borno. May Allah guide and protect him, it stated.
