Police in Mozambique say they have killed nine insurgents following the recent beheading of 10 people. The suspects were shot dead in a dense bush near the northern villages where the decapitations took place. Another person was beheaded the day before the insurgents were killed. An Islamist group, known locally as al-Shabab or al-Sunna, has carried out a number of attacks in northern Mozambique in recent months. The authorities say more than 300 people suspected of having links to the group have been arrested since October last year.
