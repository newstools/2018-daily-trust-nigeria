Australiaâ€™s parliament has passed a package of new laws aimed at preventing foreign interference in the country. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the crackdown last December. Although he denied it was aimed specifically at China, the move has added to diplomatic tensions with Beijing in recent months. The wide-ranging laws, approved in the Senate on Thursday, target foreign interference in politics and other domestic affairs, as well as espionage. Among key provisions, they will require lobbyists for foreign governments to identify themselves on a public register.
