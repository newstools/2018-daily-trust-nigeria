The Department of State Services (DSS) has arraigned 30 members of a notorious gang that specialised in phone snatching. Shila gangs are mostly teenagers who move about on tricycles, snatching mobile phones and bags from unsuspecting residents, sometimes using daggers to scare or hurt their victims. A DSS officer told the Nassarawo Area Court in Yola that hard drugs and dangerous weapons were recovered during a raid on Aisha Gandi Night Club and a place known as Sambisa Forest on the outskirts of Yola. The court presided by Japheth Ibrahim Basani ordered that the suspects be remanded in Jimeta and Yola prisons for further investigation. In a related development, the spokesman of the Adamawa State Police Command, SP Othman Abubakar, said the command had recently prosecuted over 20 Shila boys in various courts in the state. Abubakar lamented that in some cases parents and the judiciary were frustrating police efforts, saying suspects were often released in court.
