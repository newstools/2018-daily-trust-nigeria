A businesswoman, Ogundipe Monsurat, yesterday urged an Agege Customary Court in Lagos to dissolve her 14-year-old marriage to her husband, Sheriff Ogundipe, for lack of sex and love. The petitioner, who resides at Ijaiye Street, Abule Egba area of Lagos, told the court that she was no longer interested in the union. “My husband is a chronic liar and has denied me of sex for over two years. He is a drunkard, and this usually leads to shame and serious embarrassment for me and our children. I can no longer bear the emotional and verbal torture I suffer in his hands”, she said. The mother of three said that her husband does not beat her but the torture and emotional abuse she goes through is unbearable. She told the court that her husband once confessed to having an extramarital affair with another woman who kept calling and swearing on the phone. The husband, an immigration officer with the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), however, denied the claims against him but admitted not having any sexual relationship with her. He urged the court to dissolve the marriage, saying he no longer loves his wife. “I try my best to cater for my family but my wife is never satisfied,” he said. Ogundipe, who resides at NIS Quarters at Muritala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos, described the petitioner as arrogant. He said that she is not submissive to him. He admitted that he was also flirting with other women because his wife refused to have sex with him. “Since my body is not firewood, I decided to go out,” he said. Sherif told the court that his wife is disrespectful and keeps bad friends who misleads her. “Trouble started when my younger sister came to stay with us, my wife declared that she will not have sex with me until my sister leaves the house.” The Court’s President, Mrs Ibironke Elabor, advised the estranged couple to keep the peace and adjourned the case till July 26, 2018 for Alternative Dispute Resolution.
