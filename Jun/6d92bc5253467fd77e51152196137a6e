President Muhammadu Buhari today expressed concerns over some changesÂ  introduced into the 2018 budget by the National Assembly.   He spoke at the Presidential Villa in Abuja this afternoon after signing the budget.   He said the legislature made reductions totalling N347bn in the allocations to 4,700 projects presented before it and introduced 6,403 projects of their own amounting to N578 billion   "I am however concerned about some of the changes @nassnigeria has made to the budget proposals I presented.   "The logic behind the Constitutional direction that budgets should be proposed by the Executive is that, it is the Executive that knows & defines its policies & projects.   "Unfortunately, that has not been given much regard in what has been sent to me. The National Assembly made cuts amounting to N347 billion in the allocations to 4,700 projects submitted to them for consideration and introduced 6,403 projects of their own amounting to N578 billion.   "As it is, some of these projects relate to matters that are the responsibility of the States and Local Governments, and for which the Federal Government should therefore not be unduly burdened."
