The Chairman of the Senate committee on Banking, Insurance and other financial institutions, Senator Rafiu Ibrahim (APC, Kwara) said yesterday that they were ready for any eventuality at today’s convention. Rafiu, a diehard loyalist of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki said they would all be in attendance at the convention ground. He was reacting to the report that delegates in the camp of the Senate President would not be recognized. “We are waiting for that but we are coming to the convention. It is not the convention committee that certifies delegates, it is the National Working Committee (NWC) that does that. It was the chairman of our camp that was sworn in as the APC chairman in Kwara state. So, I wouldn’t know why they will not recognize our delegates. You know there are rumours ongoing because of the crises in the party; but as Alhaji Kawu Baraje said, we are going to be there, “ he said. On the report that they were dumping APC today, he said: “We have never said so, it is the media that are saying so. When it is time to do so, we will let you know. It is not going to be done secretly.”
