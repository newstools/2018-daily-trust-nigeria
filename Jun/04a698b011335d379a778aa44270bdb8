The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, will formally defect from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). An APC chieftain, who preferred anonymity, confided in our reporter yesterday that arrangements have been concluded after due consultations for Alhaji Mustapha to dump opposition APGA for the APC. He said the chairman had met with some relevant stakeholders of the party, including the FCT minister, Muhammadu Musa Bello, before arriving at the decision. “In fact, the national chairman of Buhari/Osinbajo, grassroot mobilizer, Hajiya Fatima Mohammed Gwani, was the one who even facilitated the defection of the council chairman, which is now set for Thursday this week,” he said. The council chairman, Adamu Mustapha, confirmed his formal defection to the ruling APC to our reporter via telephone yesterday. “Yes, it is true. I and my entire supporters and cabinet members shall formally defect to APC on Thursday by the grace of God,” he said. When contacted, the Gwagwalada chapter chairman of the APC, Alhaji Hussain Deze, however said he was not aware of the defection of the chairman from APGA to the ruling APC in the area. “But for you telling me now, I am not aware as I have not received any letter regarding the defection of the chairman to APC,” he said. The special adviser to the chairman of the council on media and publicity, Usman Baba Lado, however, said arrangements were being made to serve the APC chairman in the area with a letter intimating him of the chairman’s defection to APC on Thursday. APGA is the only opposition party that won in the April, 16, 2016 election among the six area councils in the FCT.
