Super Eagles striker, Ahmed Musa returned to the starting line-up with devastating effect as he scored both goals for Nigeria yesterday against group D oponents Iceland to help the Eagles resuscitate their World Cup campaign in Russia. Left out of his country’s opening Group D game at the tournament in Russia, Musa showed his worth with two outstanding strikes that put the Eagles of Nigeria back in contention for a second round place. The opening goal, soon after a drab first half, saw him pluck the ball out of the air with his first touch before blasting it home. The second goal came in the 75th minute, when after a break down the wing, Musa cut inside and waltzed around the goalkeeper before firing the ball into the net. Iceland’s Gylfi Sigurdsson shot an 82nd minute penalty over the top of the bar, denying his team a chance to try to force a late comeback. All three other teams in the group remain in the hunt to go through with Croatia, but Argentina and Iceland know they have to win to have any chance of progressing. With the win over Iceland, a draw with Argentina might be enough to see the Eagles qualifying from the group. However, a former international, Tijani Babangida who congratulated the Eagles on the victory over Iceland wants them to go all out for victory over Argentina on Tuesday. “I want to join other Nigerians in congratulating the Super Eagles for a job well done. “It was a good performance from the team, especially Ahmed Musa who scored his second World Cup brace for the Super Eagles. “I want to urge them to go for the maximum points against Argentina in their final group match,” he said.
