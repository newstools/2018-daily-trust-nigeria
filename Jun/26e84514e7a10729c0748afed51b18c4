Founder and Chief Custodian of Al-Ihsan Balsuma Children’s Home Kaduna, Hauwa Hassan Salisu, popularly called Uwar Marayu (mother of orphans)died Monday night at the 44 Army Reference Hospital Kaduna after battling with cancer for years. She was buried at the Nassarawa Muslim cemetery on Tuesday amidst many sympathisers. Aged 46, Hauwa is survived by her six biological children and over 100 adopted children. Until her death, she ran a privately owned home for orphans and less privileged in Nassarawa, Kaduna State. Though a civil servant with a meagre salary, Hauwa provided succour for every child or person that crossed her path. The home comprised over 100 children from the ages of 0-17 years. The children are largely orphans, rejected children and mentally impaired. Aged women that have nobody to cater for them also visit the home to get assistance from uwar marayu as she is popularly called. Co-founder/chairperson of AL ILM child Trust Foundation, Aisha Yakubu said, “Indeed humanity has lost one of its finest, a compassionate mother to the orphans and downtrodden, a fighter, an exceptional Rare Gem.”
