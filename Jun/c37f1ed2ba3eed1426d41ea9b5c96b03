President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Justice Abdul Kafarati as the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court (FHC). Kafarati has been in acting capacity since September last year following the retirement of Justice Ibrahim Auta. Senate President Bukola Saraki read the President’s request on Kafarati’s confirmation during plenary session yesterday. No legislative action has been taken on the request. It is expected to be referred to the Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal matters committee chaired by Senator David Umaru (APC, Niger) for screening.
