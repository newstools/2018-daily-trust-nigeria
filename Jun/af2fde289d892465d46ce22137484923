Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), said the commission is worried about the low rate of collection of the newly-printed PVCs of new registrants across the country. Yakubu made the remark while responding to questions at the INEC/ Private Sector Forum, organised by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), yesterday in Lagos. According to him, it was worrisome that over 7 million PVCs from the 2015 General Elections were yet to be claimed but more worrisome is the rate at which newly-registered voters are coming to claim the newly-printed PVCs. He said, “We are doing the best we can to ensure that registrants collect their cards but unfortunately many of these cards are still not collected.’’ On the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, the INEC boss said that 9.7 million Nigerians had so far registered and the number would increase. He said that if the figure was added to the existing 69. 7 million registered voters, INEC would have a register of over 80 million in the 2019 General Elections. “For transfers, so far, we have 474, 358 requests across all the states of the federation since the commencement of the ongoing CVR on April 27, 2017. “For those who applied for transfers, as well as those who registered newly in 2017, we have printed the cards for 2.9 million new registrants.” He said INEC will conduct elections in 119, 973 polling units and 8,809 wards nationwide, saying it was ordinarily impossible to create additional polling units before the 2019 elections.
