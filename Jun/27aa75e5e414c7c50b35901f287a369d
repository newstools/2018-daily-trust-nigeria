Russian social media users have rallied in support of a teacher who lost her job after photos emerged of her in a swimsuit online.

Viktoria Popova, 26, was sacked by School Number 7 in Omsk for "bringing her school and profession into disrepute", according to the Siberian Times.

The decision to fire her was made after photos of her modelling swimwear were posted to Instagram, although they have since been deleted.

Over 3,000 people have since shared photos of themselves wearing swimsuits to protest against the decision using the hashtag "teachers are people too".

Much of the reaction online has been positive, with one person calling the teacher's sacking an "outrageous example of hypocrisy, stupidity and idiocy".

She added: "We are teachers, but we are also humans, therefore we have the right to look different outside the school and in our social media."

One person dismissed the decision as "absolutely mad", while another recalled a time when "there was no necessity to protect yourself for stupid reasons" and criticised the school for sacking the teacher.
