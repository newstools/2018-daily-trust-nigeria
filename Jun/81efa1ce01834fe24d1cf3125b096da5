While prosecution counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) was urging the court to impose the maximum sentence to serve as deterrent, Dariye signified to the court that he wanted to say something.

Let us not spoil tomorrow because of today. Can you raise your hand to swear there is a saint in Nigeria?” However, Jacobs told the court that because of the rampant nature of the offence, the court was expected to pass a severe sentence for deterrence. Dariye was convicted on 11 counts bordering on criminal breach of trust and sentenced to 14years imprisonment, the maximum sentence provided for by the law. He was also convicted on four counts bordering on criminal misappropriation and sentenced to two years imprisonment, the maximum allowed. The judge however held that the sentences would run concurrently, meaning Dariye would spend a maximum of 14 years in prison.
