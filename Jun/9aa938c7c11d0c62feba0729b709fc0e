The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for declaring June 12 as Democracy Day.
The group also commended the President for posthumously awarding the highest honour of GCFR, to late Chief MKO Abiola, the purported winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election.
The Director, MURIC, Professor Ishaq Akintola, in a statement yesterday, also commended the President for honouring Abiolaâ€™s running mate, Ambassador Baba Gana Kingibe, with a GCON, and late Chief Gani Fawehinmi SAN, with the GCON.
He also urged President Buhari to among others revisit the late Ken Saro Wiwa, the environmental activist of the Niger Delta issue, saying his case still hurts the Ogoni people in particular and the Niger Delta region in general.
