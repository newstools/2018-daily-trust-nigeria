Former police chief Kale Kayihura has come forward to deny he has been arrested amid conflicting - and confusing - reports. Reports of his arrest began to circulate on Tuesday, shocking some Ugandans, who saw him as being too powerful. But now the government-owned New Vision newspaper quotes General Kayihura himself as saying he is not under arrest. Gen Kayihura has been seen as one President Yoweri Museveni’s most powerful backers. He joined the president’s rebel force in the 1980s before it seized power more than 30 years ago. He then worked his way up the army ranks, commanding operations in Democratic Republic of Congo, until he was appointed police chief. But human rights campaigners say his time in office was marred by the violent clampdown on protests and allegations of torture.
