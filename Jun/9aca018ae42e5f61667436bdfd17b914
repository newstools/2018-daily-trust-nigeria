The declaration of June 12 as a public holiday by President Muhammmadu Buhari is a mere desire, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has said. Malami yesterday evening emphasised that June 12 could not be a public holiday until the Public Holiday Act was amended by the National Assembly. He was reacting to criticisms trailing the presidential declaration recognising June 12 as National Democracy Day in honour of the presumed winner of the annulled 1993 presidential election, Late M.K.O. Abiola. The minister, who spoke to State House correspondents, was responding to a question on whether the declaration did not contravene the Public Holiday Act. “As it relates to public holidays, there is truly a Public Holiday Act but it is about the process and process of amendment. At any rate, the Act can be amended and the process of amendment has been put in place. “So, when the Act has been fully amended, the declaration of the President will come into effect. It is a declaration of intention, a declaration of desire and that will eventually be given effect with the act of amendment of the existing law,” the minister said.
