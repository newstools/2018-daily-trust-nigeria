Nadir disclosed this when he paid a courtesy visit to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amb. Olukunle Bamgbose, in Abuja.

Ambassador Nadir noted the excellent bilateral relations between Nigeria and Egypt particularly with regards to military cooperation. The minister stressed the need for both countries to re-establish political consultations with a view to addressing matters affecting their bilateral relations.

He assured the vice minister of his readiness to quicken the process of re-establishing the bilateral political consultations. The Permanent Secretary said that the platform would be an avenue to deepen existing relations between the two countries.
