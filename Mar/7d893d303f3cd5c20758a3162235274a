Special adviser to Governor Nasir Elrufai on political affairs, Malam Uba Sani has threatened to sue the senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial zone, Senator Shehu Sani for libel.  Uba Sani gave the indication through his counsel after a visit to a magistrate court in Kaduna where he alleged that he was not invited by the court to clear his name for it to appear in a newspaper.  The political adviser expressed shock as he said the name of the suspect described in the newspaper report as being sponsored by him to attack Senator Sani was ‘fake.’  He said the address of the so-called suspect,  given as No.2 Rafin Guza is also an uncompleted building.  Uba Sani through his counsel said  nowhere in the proceedings of the Magistrate court was his name ever mentioned, adding that "the newspaper report was built around a suspicious police First Information Report (FIR) and we have every reason to believe it was a smokescreen, politically-motivated and designed  to dent the image of our client and his Political ambition.  He said "consequently,  we will file a suit in court to demand compensation for the false,  malicious  and politically-motivated media attack sponsored by Senator Shehu Sani against our client.  "We are all too familiar with the Senator's antecedents and now is the time to apply the law to bring an end to his dirty antics", he stressed.  Governor Nasir Elrufai had weeks ago, instituted a similar case against the senator.
