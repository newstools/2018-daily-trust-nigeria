Police in Brazil have arrested lawyer José Yunes, who is a close friend and ex-advisor to President Michel Temer. Mr Yunes was detained over corruption allegations surrounding the awarding of concessions at Brazil’s busiest container port, which he denies. President Temer himself is under investigation for allegedly issuing a decree which benefited a logistics firm in the port in exchange for bribes. The president has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Yunes’s arrest was part of a larger federal police operation which saw five other influential figures also arrested. The jailing of Mr Yunes, a lawyer with 50 years experience, was “an attack on Mr Yunes and the people [of Brazil”, his lawyer said.
