The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday joined other Nigerians to celebrate former President Olusegun Obasanjo on the occasion of his 81st birthday. The APC, through its National Publicity Secretary, Malam Bolaji Abdullahi, said that it joined family, friends, well-wishers and associates in celebrating the retired general who had emerged as a bastion of democracy, good governance and development in Nigeria and beyond. The party said that Chief Obasanjo had inspired a generation of Nigerians in the areas of entrepreneurship, leadership and education, especially through his non-profit initiatives, the Africa Leadership Forum (ALF) and the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library. The party also said that his legacy as President had continued to inspire good governance on the continent even after so many years, stressing that he remained an influential voice in different facets of our national life. “As a true Nigerian patriot and statesman, Chief Obasanjo has over the years built solid bridges across political divides in the country, on the African continent and the world at large. “Our prayer is that Chief Obasanjo continues to age in health and wisdom as he contributes to the unending task of nation building,” part of the statement signed by Malam Abdullahi read.
