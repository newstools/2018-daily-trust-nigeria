Three market women who were abducted by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers on Abuja- Lokoja road have regained their freedom. The Kwali Divisional Police (DPO), CSP Dauda Lambert, said the abducted women were set free Sunday night. When asked whether a ransom was paid to the kidnappers before the women were set free, he said “Well, I don’t know about any ransom, but the women have been released. And as I am talking to you right now, I am with them at the hospital,” the DPO told our reporter via telephone. A relative of one of the victims, Shedrack Musa, had told our reporter that the incident happened at about 7:36 pm last Thursday when the women were returning from Kwali market to their village at Kwaita. He said the women boarded an unmarked Golf car after selling their goods at Kwali market when suspected gunmen emerged from the bush between Piri and Kamadi brandishing weapons and flagged down the vehicle. He said the gunmen whisked away the three women who were among the passengers in the car into the bush. “It was the other passengers that raised alarm on reaching Kwaita village and their relatives went and informed the police at Kwali,” he said. Our reporter learnt that the gunmen had called the relatives of the victims demanding for a N2 million ransom for each of them on Saturday. The chairman of Kwali Area Council, Mr. Joseph K. Shazin, who confirmed the kidnap of the women via telephone said he was saddened and shocked when he was alerted about the abduction. He said he immediately called the Kwali divisional police headquarters to intimate them about the kidnap.
