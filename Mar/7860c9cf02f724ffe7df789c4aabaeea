The Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State, Alhaji Sani Gwamna Mayanchi, yesterday, said they are in court to challenge the tenure elongation of the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun-led National Working Committee (NWC) because the extension is illegal. Mayanchi said they had filed a law suit before a Federal High Court in Abuja seeking the nullification of the tenure extension. He said fresh election must hold at the expiration of the NWC’s tenure by June 30, 2018, adding that the election would add fresh impetus to the party as new crop of leaders would come in to steer its affairs. He contended that the tenure elongation for the party’s leadership by one year was an affront to the APC Constitution, saying all the members were solidly behind the decision to challenge the action in court. “Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution and Articles 13 and 17 of APC constitution are against the action of the state excos; and any move to extend the tenure of the party’s leadership by even one day will be resisted,” he added. Meanwhile, the court has fixed March 27, for hearing.
