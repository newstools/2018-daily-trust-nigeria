More than 33 people have been killed in a fresh outbreak of ethnic violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, authorities say. Unrest broke out between the Hema and Lendu communities in the north-eastern province of Ituri. A UN-sponsored broadcaster said the assailants were eventually forced back by security forces. More than 100 people have been killed by violence in the province since mid-December. The unrest between the Hema cattle herders and Lendu farmers of the Ituri region is one of several conflicts in DR Congo which have produced a huge amount of refugees and internally displaced people over the past two years.
