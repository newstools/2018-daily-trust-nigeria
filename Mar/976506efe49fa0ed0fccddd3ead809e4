The FCT sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Corps Commander Ayuba Gora Wobin, has called on motorists to respect the regular marshals of the corps on the highways. Wobin, who spoke during a national patrol organized by Gwagwalada unit of the FRSC special marshal on Saturday, said the special marshal was the second arm of the regular marshal that has power to arrest, book, prosecute and educate motorists that violate traffic rules and regulations. He said the special marshal had organized several workshops and seminars on safety on the highways with the aim of reducing crashes. “So I want to pass the message to the motoring public that anywhere they see special marshals, they should give them the respect just like other uniform personnel on duty,” he said. The FRSC commander further called on motorists to ensure they obey traffic rules and regulations, adding that the corps is ever ready to prosecute any motorists that violate traffic rules and regulations. Also speaking, the Gwagwalada unit commander of the FRSC, ACC Sunday Attah, said the command was hosting the national patrol where all the unit commands across the FCT converged on the area to carry out patrol and enlightened the motorists. He added that the national patrol was also to checkmate some erring motorists, especially commercial drivers who engaged in reckless driving and overloading of their vehicles. “Most importantly, the activities of the special marshals are to send signals to the public that what they are doing is what we the regular marshals are also doing in terms of curtailing crashes and safety on our roads,” he said.
