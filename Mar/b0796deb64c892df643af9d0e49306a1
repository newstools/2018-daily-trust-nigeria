Following a confirmed case of Lassa fever, the Ghanaian health authority said it has imposed surveillance and screening procedures at the various entry points into the country. All the nation’s land borders and international airports have been mounted with enhanced surveillance and screening, a statement from the Ministry of Health said. According to the Director of Public Health, Dr Badu Sarkodie, the Ghana Health Service had issued a red alert about the disease two weeks ago, following escalation of the disease in Nigeria. Ghana’s lone case occurred last week, after samples from a 26-year-old man, who had died from symptoms associated with Lassa fever tested positive to the disease. Blood sample of the deceased was taken to the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research for laboratory investigation. It confirmed Lassa fever. The patient, who died at Tema General Hospital in the Greater Accra Region was reported to have been rushed to the hospital on February 23 with complaints of general body weakness, severe headache, joint pains, profuse vomiting of blood with clot. He died on February 28.
