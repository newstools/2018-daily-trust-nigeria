The body of a Catholic priest who went missing last week has been found mutilated in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), according to local media. Florent Mbulanthie was discovered on the banks of the Kasai River, near Ilebo, in the west of the country, Radio Okapi reported. His colleague Father Gorges Menga told the radio station the priest’s face was so damaged, he could not be recognised. He added: “But when [the police] told me about the trouser, and clergymen shirt he wore, the sandals, the watch and rosary on his neck, I said it is him, bring him please.”
