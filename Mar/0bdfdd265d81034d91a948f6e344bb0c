A man identified as Ewuga was electrocuted while trying to fix a disconnected light in Bayan Loco, Kafanchan, Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State Tuesday evening. Ewuga who was said to be a casual staff of Kaduna Electric, climbed the affected electric pole but had a swarm of bees as his nemesis, according to residents who said the fear of attack by the bees led to his death. One of the residents told Daily Trust that the deceased fixed the disconnected light but died trying to escape from the bees. “In the movement of trying to avoid the bees, he touched the naked electric wire. He died on coming in contact with the current before he could get medical attention,” the resident said.
