Nigeria’s Chairman of the Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts, Senator Shehu Sani has reacted to the tenure elongation of the All Progressive Congress (APC) National Working Commitee (NWC), led by John Oyegun, chairman of the party. President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday asked the national excutive commitee (NEC) of the party to consider reversing the tenure extension of the NWC. He pointed out that the elongation is not in the party's constitution. Sani in a tweet said,"Hannibal of Carthage has sided with the Persian anti extension forces lead by Lord of the Admiralty Asiwaju, to push back the Roman forces of extension led by King Oyegun,Rome is left embattled and in ruins". Hannibal of Carthage has sided with the Persian anti extension forces lead by Lord of the Admiralty Asiwaju, to push back the Roman forces of extension led by King Oyegun,Rome is left embattled and in ruins.
