Sheikh Dahir Usman Bauchi Foundation has cautioned the Bauchi State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) against interference in the activities of Tsangaya schools built by the Federal Government in the state. This was contained in a statement signed by the National Director, Media and Publicity of the foundation Malam Ahmad Muhammad Saka in Bauchi. He said the problems in the schools were caused by interference using SUBEB by some elements on the board. According to the statement, the stoppage of recitation of Wazifah and Salatul Fatih by SUBEB violated the freedom of Tijjaniyyah adherents in the state.‎ Saka said initially the Federal Government built the Tsangaya for Sheikh Dahiru as part of fulfilment of the pledge to build one Tsangaya school for him by the former Vice President Namadi Sambo. Bauchi SUBEB Chairman, Professor Yahaya Ibrahim Yaro, had during a press conference said the board barred teaching of Wazifah and recitation of Salatul Fatih because of the complaints they received from parents, adding that they were not in the curriculum of the Tsangaya Schools. In a statement by the State Commissioner of Education Professor Haruna Abdullahi Danwanka said “Sequel to the lingering issue concerning Tsangaya Model Schools between Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi, and SUBEB on the mode of curriculum in Tsangaya Schools, the government is deeply concerned about the situation. “Consequently His Excellency the Executive Governor of Bauchi State MA Abubakar Esq directed that SUBEB should stay action until a committee is constituted with a view to finding an amicable solution to this unfortunate incident, All Parties should remain calm and abide by the extant law.”
