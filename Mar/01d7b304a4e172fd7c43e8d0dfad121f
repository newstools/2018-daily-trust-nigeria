The #BringBackOurGirls movement has threatened to sue the Federal Government for the ‘criminal negligence’ which led to the abduction of students of the Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi Yobe State. The group has issued the federal government a 7 day notice to rescue the girls or it will commence legal action. The group’s lawyer, Femi Falana stated this at a press conference yesterday, during its march to the Presidential Villa, Abuja to demand for the rescue of all citizens abducted by insurgents. Falana said the group was going to court to not only demand for the rescue of the abducted girls but to demand for sanctions of those responsible for the students’ safety. “Having regards to the circumstances of the development in that part of the country it is intolerable that the same manner of abduction took place. Are we being told that there was no security for those schools in the North East region?” he queried.
