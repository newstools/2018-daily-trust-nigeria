The unveiling of members of the new group that emerged in the Senate has upset the camp of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, Daily Trust gathered. Daily Trust had last week exclusively reported the emergence of the group as a result of the crisis that trailed the passage of the reordered election sequence. It was gathered the roll call of the group was unveiled at a meeting late Thursday night held at the residence of a former governor who is a senator. An impeccable source in the group said the group has been christened, “Pro Buhari Senators”. He said the agenda of the group was to champion Buhari’s cause and rebel against any legislation or act targeted at him. The membership of the group has been leaked to the Saraki camp, but was requested not to be made public, hence the apprehension. The source said they had 11 senators in the Southwest, 4 in South south, 2 in Southeast, 3 in North central, 11 in Northwest and 9 in Northeast. In all, he said they have 40 senators. However, one of the names mentioned in the list  told our correspondent that he had never attended any meeting of the group. He said he was wary of participating because of the attitude of the president towards the legislature. But a senator in Saraki’s camp punctured the claim of the group, saying the rebels are in minority. He advised the rebel group to turn a new leaf by supporting the leadership of the Senate to strengthen the legislative arm of government.
