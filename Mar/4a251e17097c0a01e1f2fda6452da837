Ajax cut the gap to Eredivisie leaders PSV Eindhoven to seven points following their comfortable 4-1 victory against Heerenveen.

PSV suffered a shock 5-0 defeat at struggling Willem II on Saturday to leave the chance for Erik Ten Hag's side to reduce the deficit at the top of the table, and on Sunday Ajax took the lead on 31 minutes through 18-year-old centre-back Matthijs de Ligt.

However, Real Madrid loanee Martin Odegaard equalised for Heerenveen two minutes later with a stunning effort from 30 yards to go into half-time all square.

Nicolas Tagliafico put Ajax back in front before two goals in the final three minutes from Donny Van de Beek and David Neres added gloss to the scoreline.

FC Utrecht returned to winning ways in emphatic style with a 5-1 drubbing of Vitesse Arnhem.

Jean-Paul de Jong's saw their eight-match unbeaten come to an end at PSV last week but Willem Janssen and Zakaria Labyad put the hosts into a 2-0 half-time lead, before Navarone Foor replied for Vitesse 10 minutes after the restart.

However, that was as good as it got for the visitors as Sander van de Streek restored the two-goal cushion on the hour mark, with a double from Yassine Ayoub collecting a routine three points.

AZ Alkmaar suffered their first defeat of 2018, falling 2-1 at reigning league champions Feyenoord.

AZ were unbeaten in their last nine matches heading into the clash at De Kuip but fell behind to a Jean-Paul Boetius strike.

Nicolai Jorgensen netted his first goal of 2018 to double Feyenoord's lead in the second half before Wout Weghorst grabbed a late consolation for the visitors.

FC Groningen picked up their first win since the turn of the year with a 2-0 triumph over PEC Zwolle.
