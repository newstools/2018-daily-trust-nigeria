The Department of State and Local Government Affairs from the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation has urged area councils to provide good governance to the people. Mr Kayode Adebayo, who led a delegation from the department to Abaji yesterday, said they were on tour of the area councils to ascertain the effectiveness of local government system. He said they wanted to ensure that the existing projects have direct bearing on the lives of the people. Adebayo said if they are functioning well, they would discourage rural to urban migration, insecurity, tackle unemployment and foster peaceful cohabitation among diverse groups in the local councils. “After going round to see some of the projects you have executed, the department will look at how reward system will be introduced for the best local government, “ he said. Responding, the chairman of Abaji area council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, said his administration had utilized available resources to provide viable projects for residents of the council. He noted that despite the paucity of funds, the council had not relented in its efforts to touch the lives of youths and women across the 10 wards of the council. The chairman commended the delegation for the visit saying the development would help to correct so many things and will encourage better performance amongst the council chairmen.
