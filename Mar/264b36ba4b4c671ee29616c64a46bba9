 A pregnant woman who was physically and verbally abused by hospital staff has won a landmark case against staff at Bungoma country hospital in Kenya who left her to deliver on the floor. A high court judge ruled that the hospital, the country government and the secretary of health in the government cabinet had violated Josephine Majani’s human rights—both under Kenya’s constitution and international law when she gave birth at the hospital in 2013. The court ruled that the physical and verbal abuse the patient suffered infringed upon her rights to health and dignity and was inexcusable.
