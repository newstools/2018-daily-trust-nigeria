The Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) has said that the 13.5 million collected by each senator as running cost and N750,000 as salary is not in the Remuneration Act of 2008 and therefore is not known to the Commission. In reaction to Senator Shehu Sani’s statement that each Senator collects monthly running cost of N13.5 million and a salary of N750,000 a month, the commission said in a statement yesterday that  the Law on Salaries and Allowances of Public Office holders is very clear and as such, it is only the management of the National Assembly Service Commission that can explain  the N13.5 million running cost allegedly being enjoyed by each Senator as  the Act only covers Salary and Allowances but not Running Cost. “A closer look at the monthly entitlement of Senators reveals that each Senator collects salary and allowances of the sum of N1,063,860:00 consisting of the following basic-N168,866:70, motor vehicle fuelling and maintenance allowance N126,650:00, Personal Assistant N42,216:66, Domestic Staff-126,650:00, Entertainment-N50,660:00, Utilities-N50,660:00, Newspapers/Periodicals-N25, 330:00,Wardrobe-N42,216,66:00, House Maintenance-N8,443.33:00 and Constituency-N422,166:66 respectively”

“It is instructive to note that some allowances are regular while others are non-regular. Regular allowances are paid regularly with Basic Salaries while Non-Regular allowances are paid as at when due. For instance, Furniture allowance (N6,079,200:00); and Severance Gratuity (N6,079,200:00) are paid once in every tenure while Motor Vehicle Loan-(N8,105,600:00) is optional which the beneficiary has to offset before leaving office”. The payment of Running Cost is not part of  RMAFC mandate, therefore only the NASS can explain it.  “Any other payments enjoyed by any political, or public office holders outside those provided in the Remuneration Act of 2008 is not known to the Commission and the Chief Accounting Officer of the Agencies concerned should explain it.” The statement added. The statement added that auditing does not fall within the purview of the Commission. Thus, RMAFC also wishes to use this opportunity to state that any other payments enjoyed by any political, or public office holders outside those provided in the Remuneration Act of 2008 is not known to the Commission and the Chief Accounting Officer of the Agencies concerned should explain it.

To avoid misinformation and misrepresentation of facts capable of misleading citizens and members of the International Community, the Commission considers it most appropriate and necessary to request Nigerians and any other interested party to avail themselves of the opportunity to access the actual details of the present Remuneration package for Political, Public and Judicial Office holders in Nigeria published.
