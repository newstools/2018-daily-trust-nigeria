The Court of Appeal in Abuja yesterday dismissed the appeal by Senator Dino Melaye seeking to stop the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from beginning his recall process. The court described Melaye’s appeal as lacking in merit, inchoate and disclosed no cause of action. A Federal High Court in Abuja presided over by Justice Nnamdi Dimgba had in September 2017 given INEC the nod to begin Melaye’s recall process, which made him to appeal the decision. But a unanimous judgment delivered by Justice T.O. Awotoye dismissed Melaye’s claim that he was not given fair hearing by INEC, saying the electoral umpire was neither a tribunal nor a court of law. The appellate court said there was no limit to the counting of the 90 days for the recall process, as it could be extended. Melaye had argued that since INEC and the constituents of Kogi West Senatorial District failed to complete the recall process within the 90 days provided by Section 69 (b) of the Constitution which commenced on June 23, 2017 and ended on September 23, 2017, this “renders the entire recall process invalid, null, void, wrongful, illegal, and unconstitutional.” But the trial court dismissed the suit on the ground that it was “hasty, premature and presumptuous.” Counsel to Melaye, Nkem Okoro, said the senator would challenge the decision at the Supreme Court.
