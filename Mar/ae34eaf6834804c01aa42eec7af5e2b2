Governor Nasiru Ahmed El-Rufai of Kaduna State yesterday drummed support for the member representing Makarfi/Kudan Federal Constituency of the state at the House of Representatives, Muhammad Usman, for a second term. El-Rufai said Usman has been a good representative of his constituents “as he always strives to see that their needs are addressed”. Speaking during a health programme organized by the lawmaker, El-Rufai said the people of the constituency should support the lawmaker in 2019, so that he would continue with the good work. “We should thank Muhammad Usman. His people like him, and our party likes him, and by the grace of God we’re going to have him re-elected. He always visits me for issues that have to do with his constituents of Makarfi/Kudan. “He has never come to me for any personal problem. I want to say may God reward you abundantly. He is a very dedicated lawmaker and politician. He deserves to be re-elected to continue the good work he has been doing. “If all our representatives will behave like Muhammad Usman to attract projects to their constituents, we would have been better off. “We shall return him to the House of Representatives. Based on what I see here today, he is with his people and his people are with him. You should support people that work for you not those who will steal your money,” the governor said. Earlier, the lawmaker thanked his constituents for giving him the opportunity to represent them.
