Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is in Washington for his first official visit to the country as heir to the throne.  The Prince was received on Tuesday morning by Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to the US, Prince Khalid bin Salman and the US State Department's Ambassador to the US, Sean Oler. The trip follows visits to both Egypt and the UK earlier this month, which led to a string of political and economic agreements signed between the kingdom and two of its key allies. The visit to the US is believed to build on Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the US. The Royal Court said the crown prince will meet Trump and a number of officials “to discuss bilateral relations and issues of common interest,” Saudi Press Agency reported. The meeting is focused on Iran rein and its influence in the Middle East - something both men believe is one of the biggest threats to the region.
