Botswana’s outgoing President Ian Khama has received some unusual gifts on his extensive farewell tour, reports South Africa’s Mail and Guardian news site. So far, it says, Mr Khama has been given “three cars worth more than $300,000 (£213,450), a bicycle worth $6,000, more than 1,000 cattle, 500-plus chickens and 200 or so sheep”. The news site that that President Khama cabinet gifted him “a pistol, a ranch, a tractor and cash, and some especially generous members of the opposition handed him shares in Botswana’s main telecoms company”. President Khama is to step down on Saturday after 10 years in power.
