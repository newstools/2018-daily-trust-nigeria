The Chairman of the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has apologised to Nigerians over the hardship and pain caused by a protest at Gosa which led to the blockage of the Airport Road. Candido who was joined by the Coordinator of the Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD), Tanko Yamau, and the Chief of Garki, Alhaji Usman Nga-Kupi, made the plea while addressing journalists yesterday. “We apologise as a government to all the  citizens of the country who were plying that road at that particular hour and were maltreated. We tender our unreserved apology for all that happened which led to the closure of the road,” he said. He urged traditional rulers, elected councillors and political office holders to sensitise their subjects and constituents on civilised and peaceful means of pressing home their demands without causing untold hardship to others. “Any sensitive government will not be against peaceful protest, but government will never support a protest that will put pains on Nigerians; especially innocent people. The government frowns at it and we don’t expect any citizen of this country to be put in such situation again,” he said. He said communities were not expected to engage in uncivilised protests, adding that “it is not only the indigenes that live here; Nigerians, diplomats and foreigners troop into the FCT daily, and if they come and experience an uncivilised conduct, it will be a bad impression of the country.” He, therefore, urged the youths and residents to support the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) in ensuring better lifestyle for everyone. Some protesters had blocked the Airport Road over the demolition of some stalls at the Gosa Market. The protest which lasted for three days led to loss of several man hours while vehicles were damaged and people injured.
