Relatives of 68 people who died when a fire broke out at a police station in the Venezuelan city of Valencia have demanded answers about the incident. The blaze reportedly started after prisoners set fire to mattresses in an attempt to break out on Wednesday. The United Nations has called on the Venezuelan authorities to carry out a speedy investigation and to provide reparations to victims’ families. The fire is one of the deadliest incidents in Venezuela’s prisons. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement that “where applicable” those responsible should be brought to justice. On Wednesday, anguished relatives had gathered in front of the police station demanding information about their loved ones. They were dispersed by police firing tear gas.
