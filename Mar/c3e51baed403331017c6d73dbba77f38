Former Plateau State governor and senator representing Plateau central senatorial district  at the Senate, Joshua  Dariye, has condemned incessant attacks on communities in Daffo district of Bokkos local government area, leading to the loss of many lives and destruction  of properties. In a statement in Jos yesterday in reaction to last week’s attack in Daffo where about 16 people were said to have lost their lives and many houses destroyed, Dariye said the unabated attacks despite peace building meetings by the different stakeholders and the assurances to halt the violence was unfortunate. “Dialogue  remains the only solution to the lingering crisis in Bokkos and other parts of Plateau State where herders and local farmers are having misunderstanding. Resorting to taking up arms would not bring solution to the problem as two wrongs cannot make a right,” he said. Dariye called on the security agents to fish out the perpetrators of the violent act and bring them to book, saying that innocent people should not continue to live at the mercy of heartless attackers. He appealed to the victims of the attacks in Bokkos, which is also his local government area, to be patient as lasting solution was being sought.
