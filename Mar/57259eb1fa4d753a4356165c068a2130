The National Population Commission (NPC) has flagged  off the Enumeration of Area Demarcation (EAD) in Kuje, Abuja. Speaking during the flag off, the territorial director of the NPC in the FCT, Alhaji Bello Suleiman, said the process is the splitting of local governments or area councils into smaller units for ease of enumeration during census. He said this year’s housing census was going to be digital, as the commission would use technology to give Nigerians a revolutionary data. He thanked the area council chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, for his assistance to the commission, saying the data that would come out of the census would be used in almost all sectors. Also speaking, the federal commissioner of the NPC, Dr. Daniel Aliyu Baka, said the enumeration demarcation was a national exercise, which he said was going on in 16 states of the federation. He said the enumeration area demarcation exercise was being done in phases because of cash flow constraints. On his part, the chairman of Kuje area council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, pledged to give support to the enumerators with logistics to enable them reach out to rural communities.
