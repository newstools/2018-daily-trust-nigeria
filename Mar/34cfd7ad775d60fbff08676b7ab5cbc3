Goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Aaron Ramsey were enough to give Arsenal a 2-0Â  first-leg advantage over AC Milan in their Europa League last-16 tie at the San Siro on Thursday.

The impressive display ended their four-game losing run and eased the pressure off their manager Arsene Wenger.

Milan had gone 13 games without defeat before tonight's encounter.

Mkhitaryan put the visitors ahead 15 minutes into the match when he collected Mesut Ozil's pass, turned past Davide Calabria and sent a shot off the boot of Leonardo Bonucci and into the net.

After that, Danny Welbeck shot straight at Donnarumma one-on-one and Mkhitaryan clipped the crossbar with the goal at his mercy.

But on the brink of half-time, Arsenal did score a second. Ozil played a fine pass into Ramsey's path and the Wales midfielder rounded Donnarumma for an easy finish- his seventh goal of the season.
