The Management of New Nyanya Motor Park has said it is partnering with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to educate commercial drivers against illegal drug consumption. The manager of the park, Mr Atume Nathan, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Abuja. “The FRSC has been helping us in the motor park in the campaign against drug abuse by organising workshops to educate drivers on the dangers of drug abuse. “Even recently, we held a workshop to that effect and the FRSC conducted it. “We don’t intend to stop there, as we are planning to organise more for our drivers because we love our passengers. “I am aware that commercial drivers do take prohibited drugs but our drivers do not indulge in such act. “We don’t allow sale of alcohol and illegal drugs within the park. “We also conduct thorough checks on our drivers before their movement out of the park so as not to put the lives of passengers in danger,” Nathan said Nathan said the management would continue to ensure that prohibited substances were not brought into the park or any place nearby. He said speeding and illegal drug consumption were among the major causes of road accidents. “I remember I heard in the news about a ghastly motor accident recently and it was blamed on intoxication by the driver,” he said. The manager advised commercial drivers not to indulge in illegal drug consumption or anything that could put their lives and the lives of passengers in danger.
