A non-governmental organisation, One’s African Union Youth Voice Ambassadors, has said government at the federal and state levels should create more opportunities for women to gain access to funds that will enable them start up profitable businesses. Speaking during a conference to celebrate the International Women’s Day in Uyo yesterday, Coordinator of the group, Mr. Ekanem Nyeneokpon, said policy issues favouring women should be instituted to promote the vital role women played in the society. He said the organisation’s aim was to draw the attention of government to issues preventing women from gaining access to education, empowerment opportunities and access to good health. He said many women who strove to reach their potentials should be given opportunities to do so through programmes that would empower them. “Opportunities should be expanded in terms of provision of funds for women to be able to start businesses, for us to have more women entrepreneurs,” he said. Also speaking, the Campaign Assistant, One’s African Union Youth Voices Ambassadors, Mr. Olalekun Obeisesan, stressed the need for government to be more transparent and accountable in the management of public funds. He added that the only way the government could stand up to its responsibilities to the society is if members of the public spoke up on issues affecting them,
