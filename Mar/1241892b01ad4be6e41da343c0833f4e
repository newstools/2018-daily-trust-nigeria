The Kano state chapter of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) has said that Nigerians will never forgive the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP)’s 16 years of bad governance and mismanagement of public funds.

Reacting to the recent statements credited to the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, begging Nigerians to forgive the PDP over what he described as mistakes, the Deputy Chairman of APC in Kano, Honorable Shehu Maigari, said the PDP’s appeal to Nigerians was laughable.

Maigari said, the chairman of the leading opposition political party should know that Nigerians were not fools to be deceived by a party to bastardised their economy within the period of 16 years.

He explained that Nigerians would never forget the billions of dollars that were embezzled by the PDP-led government from 1999-2015 in the name of revitalising the power sector.

“The total neglect of agricultural sector which is considered to be the backbone of the nation’s economy under the PDP-led government will also not be forgotten by Nigerians. Likewise, the diversion of billions of naira meant for the purchase of weapons for our gallant soldiers to fight Boko Haram insurgents will never be a bye-gone issue.

“As far as APC Kano is concerned, the so-called PDP mistakes were costly to be forgiven. No right thinking Nigerian will forget and forgive these kinds of expensive mistakes,” Maigari said.

He assured that the leadership approach adopted by the APC-led government was the solution to Nigerian’s challenges of insecurity and high level of corruptions that was inherited from the PDP.

The APC deputy chairman said Nigerians were politically wise to decide for themselves, noting that they were not unmindful of the efforts being made by the Buhari-led government in rescue the nation’s economy from total collapse.
