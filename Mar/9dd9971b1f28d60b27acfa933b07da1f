The Sultan of Sokoto and President General of the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs in Nigeria, Alhaji Abubakar Saad 111, has stressed the need for all Muslims to take advantage of the on-going voters registration to obtain the card ahead of the 2019 general elections. Speaking at the closing ceremony of the 32nd edition of the national Quranic recitation competition in Katsina, the Sultan said it is only through the card that the people can have leaders of their choice. “Let’s get our voters card because it is with it that we can get what we desire. People will come to seek for votes and we shall then tell what we require of them”, he said. He enjoined leaders to fear God and the followers as well.   In his remarks, the state governor, Aminu Masari, said the issue of Almajiri education must be holistically looked at by all stakeholders. About 360 participants took part in the competition from 32 states and the FCT. Gombe State will host the 33rd edition of the competition.
