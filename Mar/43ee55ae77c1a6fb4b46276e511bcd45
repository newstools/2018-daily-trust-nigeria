The President of Unique Standard Bearers Montessori School, Mrs Glory Mfon, has advised parents to engage their children in sports. She made the statement during the fourth annual inter-house sports of the school which held in Abuja. Commending the good sporting spirit and team work exhibited by the participating students, Mfon said involving kids in sports would developed them physically and mentally. “I advised parents to always make their children available for this kind of competition because it helps to prepare them mentally and physically. They shouldn’t shy away from allowing their children to participate in competitions like this,” she said. Mfon also spoke of the rationale behind the sport meet. “The reason for this inter-house sport is to show that education is not all about classrooms. We develop children in all aspects of their lives and sport is one of them. That’s exactly what we are doing today, for them to be all-rounder,” she said. The game segmented into junior and senior category, boys and girls featured field tracks in 100m and 200m races including relay race. At the end of the competition, Kingfishers proved their supremacy clinching the first position, followed by Peacock in second position while the Eagles came third.
