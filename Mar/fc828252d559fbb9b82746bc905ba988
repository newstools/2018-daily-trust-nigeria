A Kogi-based lawyer has been arraigned before a Lokoja Chief Magistrateâ€™s Court on a one-count charge of forgery. Police prosecutor, Sgt. Obi Ubana, told the court, presided over by Mr. Seidu Hussein, that Julius Elukpo allegedly wrote a petition to the Minister of Health on March 22, 2017, with forged signatures of two other persons. He said Elukpo, in the petition, alleged corruption, fraud and injustice against some management staff of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Lokoja. He said the police investigated and established that two of the signatories on the petition were forged, prompting the state Commissioner of Police to institute the case against Elukpo. Sgt. Ubana said the offence was contrary to Section 364 of the Penal Code, saying that the offense carried a maximum of 14 years imprisonment. He told the court that he had lined up five witnesses; including the two persons whose signatures were allegedly forged. When the charge was read to the accused, he pleaded not guilty. The suspect was granted bail on self recognition with a N50,000 bond and is not to interfere with investigation and not to commit any other offence. The case was adjourned to March 19.
