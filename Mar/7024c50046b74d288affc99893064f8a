Governor of Delta State, Senator Dr Ifeanyi Okowa has assured that operations will resume full swing at the Asaba International Airport in July, this year.

Speaking during an inspection visit to the airport on Friday, the Governor expressed optimism that the contractor (Setraco) handling the reconstruction of the runway, has proved that the project could be delivered within three months.

Governor Okowa recalled that, “it took two years for ULO (the former contractor) to construct 900 metres of the runway but, it gladdens my heart that in just three weeks, Setraco has done 1.1 kilometre of the runway.”

“From the work programme, it may be possible for Setraco to complete the project in three and half months. The speed with which they mobilised to site is wonderful, we thank God for intervening which made us to re-award the contract,” the Governor said.

He expressed confidence that in the anticipated four months time, bigger planes would be landing at the airport.

Earlier, Setraco Area Manager, Engr Jihad Yahgi, had explained the work level done so far on the runway, besides the company's work in progress to complete the water channels at the airport.

Engr. Yahgi assured Delta State government that work will be completed on airport according to schedule and specifications.
