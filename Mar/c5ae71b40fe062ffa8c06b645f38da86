The chairman of Kuje area council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has barred Fulani herdsmen in the area from moving about with arms and cutlasses. Galadima stated this during a peace and security meeting at the weekend, which hadÂ  traditional rulers and representatives of all security agencies in attendance. He said the ban was a resolution of the security meeting, urging residents to report herders seen with arms to the nearest security post. He also said the meeting resolved that residents should be vigilant and report strangers to traditional and community leaders, who would in term report to security agents. He added that farmers whose crops had been destroyed and the police failed to settle the matter amicably should report to the Gomo of Kuje or authorities of the council. Also speaking, the Gomo of Kuje, Alhaji Haruna Jibrin Tanko, said the cases of cattle rustling, kidnapping and farmers and herders clashes were issues that needed to be tackled headlong. He stressed the need for all village and district heads across the council to ensure they govern their people with the fear of God.
