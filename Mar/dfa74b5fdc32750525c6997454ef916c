The Chairman, Akwa Ibom State Independent Electoral Commission (AKISIEC), Mr. Aniedi Ikoiwak, has said only people with Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) will be needed in the 2019 elections and not thugs who will snatch away ballot boxes. Ikoiwak, yesterday in Uyo during the commission’s tour of the 31 local government areas of the state to sensitise stakeholders on Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) and collection of PVCs, said the National Assembly had passed the Electoral Act that made the card reader the only authentic instrument for the accreditation of voters. “In 2019, there will be no need for thugs to shoot guns and scare away voters; we will not need people to hijack electoral materials. The 2019 elections will be a different ball game, your vote will count and you will use the PVC,” he said.
