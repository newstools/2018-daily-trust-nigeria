The FCT Coordinator of the Fadama III Additional Financing Project, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Salisu, has flagged off the distribution of seeds and other farm inputs for the 2018 farming in Gwagwalada. Salisu, while presenting the farm inputs, said its distribution was significant to both the project and the farmers; especially as it marked the commencement of farming activities in the FCT. He said the objective of the Fadama III Additional Finance Project was to move the rural farmers from subsistence to commercial production by ramping up of production of four selected staple crops supported by the project. In his remarks, the National Coordinator of Fadama III Additional Finance Project, Tayo Adewumi, said 5,916 candidates were successfully trained in various enterprises in livestock, crop and plantation in 23 states of the federation. Adewumi said 121 unemployed youths and women were going to benefit from the scheme in the FCT, while calling on all the production groups that had benefited from the inputs to make good use of them in line with the projectâ€™s implementation guidelines. The Secretary for Agriculture and Rural Development Secretariat of the FCT Administration, Nzekwe Stanley, said the administration was resolute to the advancement of agriculture in the territory. Stanley said the administration was working tirelessly towards ensuring the provision of inputs, linkage to sources of credit and market, as well as the provision of an enabling environment for farmers in the FCT. Among the seedlings distributed to farmers were sorghum seeds, rice seeds, sprayers and agro chemicals.
