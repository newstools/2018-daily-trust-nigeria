The Etsu Yaba in Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, has said residents may be cut-off whenever there it rains due to the bad nature of the road that leads to the community. The etsu said he was worried over the bad portion of the road which linked Yaba-Ashara and Abaji town. Adamu who spoke with our reporter at his palace yesterday, said some portions of the road were washed away during the last rainy season. He expressed fear that farmers might be unable to convey their goods to the market if government failed to act. He said the road, when rehabilitated, would boost socio-economic activities and create more revenue to the FCT. “Any moment there is heavy rainfall  like the last one we had some few days ago; the road will carve in. In fact, some vehicles have started passing through Niger State as I speak with you,” he added. He, therefore, appealed to the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, to intensify effort to ensure work commenced at the collapsed portion of the road.
