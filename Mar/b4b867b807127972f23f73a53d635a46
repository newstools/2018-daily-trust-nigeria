The National Board for Technology Incubation (NBTI) said its centres across the country have produced over 2000 different products in markets. The board’s Director General, Dr Mohammed Jibrin, revealed this when he received the management of Media Trust Limited at his office in Abuja yesterday. Jibrin said some of the products included yam flour, unripe plantain flour good for diabetic patients, pro-health grinding machines, software and engineering fabrication machines, as well as fruit drinks, packaged to meet international export standard. The NBTI boss said a business incubated within one of its centres has been enlisted on the Nigeria Stock Exchange, a testimony of the board’s efforts at ensuring that businesses were conceptualised and nurtured to growth. Jibrin decried the practice of not adding value to commodities as there were existing technologies that Nigerians could leverage to add value to commodities before being sold to increase market value of the products. He said Nigerians have no business with unemployment as there are opportunities in technology incubation centres that could help add value to raw materials. He expressed dismay that many Nigerians are not aware that they could build a cottage industry with N2 to N3 million.
