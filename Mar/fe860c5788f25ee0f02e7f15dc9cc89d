Russia has hit back with strong rhetoric as the UK continues to blame the country for the use of a nerve agent on British soil following the alleged poisoning of a former double agent. Sergei Skripal, a 66-year-old former Russian intelligence officer, was found in a collapsed state along with his 33-year-old daughter on a public bench outside a shopping centre in Salisbury, England, last month. They remain in critical condition. The UK maintains that Russia is responsible and, in a joint statement last week, the leaders of the US, Germany and France backed Britain’s claim. Russia maintains there is no proof. “Sooner or later these unsubstantiated allegations will have to be answered for: either backed up with the appropriate evidence or apologised for,” Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesperson, said in a statement on Monday.
