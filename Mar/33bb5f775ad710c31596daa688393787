The Syrian army and rebel groups early on Sunday engaged in fierce battles in Eastern Ghouta, where fighting has killed at least 1,099 civilians over the past 21 days, a war monitor said. The death toll, recorded by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) - a UK-based war monitoring group - included 227 children and 154 women. At least 4,378 others were wounded. “Warplanes covered the sky in Eastern Ghouta yesterday,” Abdelmalik Aboud, an activist in the town of Douma, said on Sunday. “The shelling was focused on the underground shelters and mosques and the places that people have tried to hide in, due to the constant bombardment,” he added. The rising toll comes amid claims of yet another chemical attack overnight on the town of Arbin in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital, Damascus.
