The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said it got approval of the Presidency and the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) on its various contracts and procurement of emergency materials. Briefing members of the House of Representatives Committee on Emergency and Disaster Preparedness during an investigative hearing on abuse of public trust at NEMA yesterday, the Director General of the agency, Mustapha Maihaja said the agency did not abuse due process in its procurement process. He said some development partners in the Northeast withdrew 85 per cent of their funding forcing NEMA to secure approval from the Presidency to procure some relief materials. Maihaja said “The approval was signed by the Vice President in a letter by the Deputy Chief of Staff. The contract was awarded to two companies as well as logistics companies for delivery. The contractors don’t get paid until deliveries are confirmed by the recipient agencies.” He denied allegation that NEMA abused procurement procedures saying “Today NEMA is one of the most investigated agencies but due process was followed in our procurements.” Speaking when he declared the hearing open, Speaker Yakubu Dogara said the House had to intervene to unravel allegations that NEMA neglected some victims of disasters in parts of the country.
