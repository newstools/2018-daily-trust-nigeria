The Defence Headquarters yesterday faulted a report by the Amnesty International (AI) that alleged complacency on the part of security forces in the abduction of 110 students of the Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State. A statement by Brig General John Agim, denied claim that security forces were forewarned of an impending attack by insurgents on Dapchi. The military accused the AI of ‘deliberately peddling falsehood’ to sabotage the planned collaboration between Nigeria and the United States to end insurgency in the North East. Agim said the report was “Outright falsehood and a calculated attempt to whip up sentiments and mislead unsuspecting Nigerians, demoralise friendly nations and people collaborating with security forces to end the forces of evil in the North-East.” He added that the only reason the AI was always bringing out damning reports about the Nigerian Military at strategic points was to sabotage the country’s collaboration with the United States of America. “They did that accurately in the previous administration and the United States invoked the Leahy law against Nigeria at the peak of the Boko Haram insurgency,” he said. Agim said no security force was informed of Dapchi school girls abduction as alleged by AI.
