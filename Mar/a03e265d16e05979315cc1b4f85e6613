The Gombe State Police Command has issued a 21-day ultimatum to people in possession of illegal and prohibited firearms and weapons to return such to the police. The state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Tairu Shina Olukolu, handed over the ultimatum yesterday after constituting a task force committee for the mopping up of illegal firearms. Olukolu said the task force, to be headed by SP Hamman Ishaku Kwambla, would immediately commence disarmament, mopping up, seizure and recovery of prohibited firearms, weapons and ammunition in the hands of militias, vigilante groups and individuals either through voluntary surrender or cordon search. He said bearers of prohibited firearms and ammunition, illegal weapons and lethal devices; whether locally fabricated or otherwise, that could cause harm, injury or death of persons, were to return them to the team at the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (CIID). The CP warned that anybody found in possession of the illegal firearms and weapons within the state other than statutory security agents after the 21-day window period would be arrested, investigated and prosecuted.
