The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Osun  has  blacklisted    Osogbo High School after some  corps members  were attacked by  students  believed to be cult members. Mr Emmanuel Attah, the  Coordinator of  NYSC  in Osun,  made this  known at the 2018 NYSC/corps employers’ workshop on Wednesday in Osogbo. Attah  said  employers were expected to provide for the   accommodation, welfare and safety needs of corps members, adding that   those who  served  in Osogbo High School in 2017 were  attacked by  students suspected to be cultists  while the institution was  unable to  guarantee their  safety. He said the failure of the principal of the school to provide  protection  for corps members was responsible for the blacklisting of   the school. The Director General of the NYSC, Brig-Gen., Sulaiman Kazaure,  represented by Mr Sadiq Ipaku, said rejection, under-utilisation,  inadequate welfare as well as  lack of accommodation and transport for  corps member were major challenges facing the scheme. Kazaure, however,  said a Federal Government circular had directed  all  Ministries, Departments and Agencies  not to reject corps members  posted to them He said  the workshop  was to appreciate the enduring partnership between the scheme and  employers. Kazaure  said the workshop was also to identify the challenges in corps administration and proffer solutions. (NAN)
