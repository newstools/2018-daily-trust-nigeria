Eleven displaced people died and dozens sustained burns following a fire outbreak at an IDPs camp in Rann, Kala-Balge local government area of Borno state yesterday. Officials of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and health workers said the fire incident started at 10.27am and lasted to about 3pm at the displaced persons camp in Rann, the headquarters of the Kala- Balge LGA. They said children and women were severely affected by the fire. A medic who works with a humanitarian aids group told Daily Trust,  “We have counted at least 11 displaced persons who died. Many were severely burnt and are currently in critical conditions; we are trying our best to restore them. He said the fire could not be put out early mainly because of shortage of water at the camp. “We are facing many challenges here, “ the medic said. The Northeast Zonal Coordinator of NEMA, Bashir Idris Garga, also confirmed the incidents but differed on the casualty figure. He said in a text message: “Update from Rann: Deaths: 5 persons (3 women and 2 children) and several people sustained burns. 200 shelters destroyed. Several livestock destroyed but source of fire outbreak unknown.”
