The Consumer Protection Council (CPC) yesterday commended the Federal Government over the recent increase in excise duty on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. The council said the move will serve as a measure to reduce the risks of abuse and disease. It also applauded the Buhari administration’s consideration for consumers in “granting a 90-day moratorium, and periodic incremental adjustments to ensure appropriate balance between personal consumer choices and the public interest.” The Council’s Director General, Babatunde Irukera, who made these assertions in a statement yesterday in Abuja, praised “President Muhammadu Buhari for his strong leadership in addressing this vital consumer issue in a manner that is consistent with prevailing global practices”. Irukera stated that though “CPC protects the rights of all consumers, and their prerogative to make personal lifestyle choices,” it however “encourages responsible consumption in all circumstances, particularly of products that may potentially have adverse effects or possibly modify behaviour in a fashion that may be harmful or inconvenient to the consumer, or others.”
