The police in Lagos have arraigned a 50-year-old man, Lekan Somorin, before an Ikeja magistrate’s court, Lagos over an alleged theft of N9.5 million. Somorin, described as treasurer of the Omole Phase 2 Residential Association, Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of forgery and theft. The prosecutor, Inspector Benson Emuerhi, told the court that the accused committed the offence between March 2016 and November 2017 at the Omole Phase 2 Residential Association C.D.A. office, Lagos. Emuerhi said the accused stole the money and falsified the association’s account records. “When he was asked about the N9.5m, he could not give any satisfactory explanation on how the money got missing. All efforts made by the complainant to get the accused to refund the money proved abortive,” he said. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. In her ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, granted the accused bail of N1m, with two sureties in like sum. Osunsanmi said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State government. She adjourned the case until May 31, 2018.
