Governor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State has faulted a comment by the Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Barrister Solomon Dalung, on the naming of a recently commissioned street after President Muhammadu Buhari. Dalung had taken to his Facebook account yesterday to blast Lalong on naming the particular street which he claimed was already named after a former head of state, General Yakubu Gowon. However, Lalong through his Commissioner of Information and Communication, Hon. Yakubu Dati, said if Dalung had bothered to check his facts, he would have found that the Yakubu Gowon Way still exists and that no road was renamed. The commissioner explained that the new Muhammadu Buhari Way starts at Mararaban Jama’a round-about through Anguldi and Bukuru expressway and ends at Ta’en round-about while “the existing Yakubu Gowon way starts at Ta’en junction through building materials - Zarmaganda junction, Miango - old airport junctions, through Secretariat overhead bridge and ends at Plateau Specialist Hospital round-about.” He added, “D. B Zang road starts from the Plateau Specialist Hospital round-about where Yakubu Gowon Way ends and ends at Hill-Station round-about while Joseph Gomwalk road then starts from Hill-station round-about and ends at Polo Club round-about.” Dati said by saying a portion of the Yakubu Gowon Way was renamed, Dalung had created a wrong impression to score cheap political point.
