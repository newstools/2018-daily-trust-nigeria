The Minister of Health, Prof Isaac Adewole, has said that the major drawback in the country’s tuberculosis program is the low case findings for both adult and children. He disclosed this yesterday while briefing newsmen on the World Tuberculosis Day in Abuja. Adewole said many tuberculosis cases were either not diagnosed or diagnosed but not reported. Prof  Adewole said the TB burden is further compounded by the menace of drug resistance TB and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. He said: “In 2017, the country notified only 109,904 out of the estimated 407,000 - all forms of TB cases (with treatment coverage of 25.8%), leaving a gap of 302,096 comprising undetected or detected but not notified cases especially in non-DOTS sites. “In the same year, the proportion of Childhood TB was 7% of all forms of TB cases compared to 10% recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, a total of 1783 DR-TB cases were notified out of the estimated 5200 DR-TB cases.”
