The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it has not cleared Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State of allegation of double registration earlier leveled against him. INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kogi State, Prof. James I. Apam, said this yesterday in Lokoja at an interactive session with members of the media and civil society organisations (CSOs) in the state. He clarified that the recent transfer of Bello’s permanent voter’s cards from Wuse in Abuja to Okene Local Government Area and subsequent issuance of a TVC to the governor did not in any way amount to acquitting him of the earlier allegation. “The fact that there is an accusation against the governor that he registered twice does not take away his rights to demand transfer of the PVC,” he said.
