The Congress of Northern Nigeria Christians (CNNC) has commended the timely release of the Dapchi school girls from captivity while it expressed concern over Leah Sharibu who is been held by Boko Haram insurgents because of her faith and her refusal to convert to Islam. Addressing newsmen in Kaduna, the CNNC media and publicity secretary, Larry Yammai said it has become obvious that the destruction project of Boko Haram is very much targeted at Christians. He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to as a matter of urgency intervene for the immediate release of the girl. It would be recalled that one of the freed girls, Khadija Grema told newsmen that one girl was left behind because she refused to denounce her faith. “She is a Christian and refused to denounce her religion,” she said. President Buhari has however assured that he will not relent in his effort to ensure Leah’s release.
