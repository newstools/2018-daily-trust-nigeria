The Executive Secretary, National Commission for Nomadic Education (NCNE), Prof. Bashir H. Usman, said that 12 nomadic schools in Benue State have been shut down as a result of the conflicts between herdsmen and farmers in the area. Prof Usman disclosed this on Friday in Benin, during the closing ceremony of the national teaching training workshop on the use of curriculum guides, record keeping, multi-grade teaching techniques and guidance and counselling for nomadic school head teachers/teachers in the South-South zone. He said the workshop was to train and retrain teachers in nomadic schools to sharpen their skills and in the process improve their output. “We have 24 nomadic schools in Benue State, 12 of them have been shut down completely due to herders/farmers conflicts. The other 12 schools that are not affected are fishers and migrants primary schools,” he said. He explained that the teachers would also be trained on effective use of curriculum guides and techniques of proper record keeping. “Guidance and counselling is particularly important to us, because it will help the teachers to counsel some of the pupils who are traumatised because of conflicts,” he said. Prof. Usman urged the participants to make use of the knowledge gained during the training and impart positively on the students through quality teaching. Also speaking,  the Deputy Director, Programme Coordinator, and Federal Ministry of Education-SDG Desk Officer, Khadijat Liman, charged the NCME to come up with a wide range of initiatives that will help address the challenges children of nomads, migrants farmers and fishermen are facing.
