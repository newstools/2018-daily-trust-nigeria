Dividend paying stocks are attractive to investors. Mr Boniface Okezie, National Coordinator, Progressive Shareholders Association of Nigeria,  said shareholders  are impressed with what they have seen given the kind of challenges that these companies operate under in the year under review. He said their 2016 result was badly hit by recession and that effect also spilled into 2017, as the cost of operation remained high not to talk of multiple taxation, cost of generating power etc.
