Commercial tricycle operators in Abuja have stated their readiness to cooperate with officers of the  Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS) in ensuring sanity in their operations. The tricycle operators under the aegis of the Abuja Tricycle Riders Association (ATRA) made this known when they paid a courtesy visit to the DRTS director, Wadata Bodinga. ATRA Chairman, Hassan Haske, also urged the directorate to look into what he described as indiscriminate arrest of members of the association while he reiterated their readiness to cooperate with the officers in ensuring that they ply only approved routes. He said the association will soon commence biometric data registration of its members in line with the demands of the DRTS. In his remarks, the DRTS director commended the riders for their willingness to cooperate with the directorate adding that the government is not against their operation as long as it is within estates and hinterlands. He said the government did not envisage the operation of keke NAPEP within the city, it has made adequate provision to accommodate them, “The government didn’t envisaged operation of tricycles in the FCT, but they are only allowed to operate within the ambit of the law because of their value to the society. For safety and security reasons, tricycles are only allowed to ply along the corridors of residential areas, so as to feed the taxis and high capacity buses.”
