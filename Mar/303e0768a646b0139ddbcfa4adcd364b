Parents of the still missing schoolgirls from Chibok town in Borno state are set to begin their journey tomorrow morning to Dapchi town to express amity with parents of the 110 schoolgirls abducted by insurgents last month. Our correspondent who was in Chibok at the weekend, gathered that the visit was essentially to sympathise with parents of the recently abducted schoolgirls from Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi. Mr. Yakubu Nkeki and Mrs. Yana Galang, Chairman and Woman Leader of the Abducted Chibok Girls Parents’ Movement for Rescue, would tomorrow lead 30 parents of mostly yet to be found Chibok girls to visit Dapchi where they would share experiences. “Our chairman has already communicated to the Chairman of the abducted Dapchi girls’ parents and chairman of the Bursari Local Government Council, notifying them of our sympathy visit to Dapchi town on 13th March,” Mrs. Galang said. She said they would go there, sit, listen and talk to one another about managing situations as traumatized parents whose daughters were still in Boko Haram’s hands. He said some parents of freed Chibok girls would be in the delegation to strengthen the faith and raise the hope of the Dapchi parents that their daughters would one day return home safely.
