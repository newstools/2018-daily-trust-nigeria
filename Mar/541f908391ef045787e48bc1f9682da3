A Federal High Court in Abuja has slated March 13, for hearing in a suit by a senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, challenging the election of Senate President, Bukola Saraki. The court, through its registrar, on March 5, served hearing notice to the respondents, including the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Abdulrazaq, who was the PDP candidate for Kwara Central, had asked the court to issue an order of mandamus compelling INEC to prosecute its officials and an agent of Saraki, of the APC. In an originating summons filed yesterday by his counsel, Sambo Muritala, Abdulrazaq accused INEC officials of manipulating INEC Forms EC 8D (1): Summary of Results from Electoral Divisional Areas, Collation at Senatorial District Level and INEC Form EC 8E (1): Declaration of Result of Election. The affected officers  are Mohammed Adenike (Returning Officer for Adigbongbo/Awe/Orimaro); Balogun Mutiat (Returning Officer for Afon); Ibrahim Tajudeen Olanrewaju (Returning Officer for Balogun Gambari); and Olowoleru Olodan (Returning Officer for Ogidi). Others are Abdulrahman Mohammed Rahim (Returning Officer for Warrah/Egbeejila/Oshin); Alhaji Ladi Hassan (Agent to Bukola Saraki); and Dr. Mulikah Ahmed, the Returning Officer for the entire Kwara Central Senatorial District. In an affidavit deposed to by his Personal Assistant, Adebayo Oloyin, Abdulrazaq alleged several irregularities in the election, including the reflection of March 29, 2015, as date for the final compilation of the results from the wards and local governments whereas the result was actually declared on March 28, 2015. He alleged that only Mulikah Ahmed and Saraki’s agent, Ladi Hassan, signed the result form on March 28, 2015.
