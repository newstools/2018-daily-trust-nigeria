Over 100,000 people in Adamawa State have dumped the PDP and APC for SDP. National Chairman of SDP, Chief Olu Falae, stated this yesterday during the official defection rally of Chief Emmanuel Bello to SDP at the Lamido Cinema in Yola. “I have come to receive Chief Emmanuel Bello and a 100,000 others who have dumped APC and PDP to join SDP. From today, they have become bona fide members of SDP,” he stated. He said SDP had been in existence for long, saying late MKO Abiola and Babagana Kingibe flew its ticket during the 1993 transition that was truncated. “Bello is a man who believes in changing the change,” Falae said. National Leader of the SDP, Professor Jerry Gana, said this was the first outing they made in 2018, adding that the SDP train was on the move to move Nigeria forward.
