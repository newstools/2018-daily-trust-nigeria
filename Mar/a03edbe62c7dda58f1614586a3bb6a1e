A former Minister of Education and one-time Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Prof. Tunde Adeniran, said yesterday that he and ex-Minister of Information, Prof. Jerry Gana, alongside their supporters dumped the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) “because Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State hijacked the party”. Adeniran, who contested the office of PDP national chairman at the December 9, 2017, national convention, lost to Prince Uche Secondus, who was alleged to have been anointed by Wike and other PDP governors. Adeniran, who is also one of the founding fathers of the PDP told Daily Trust on Sunday in a telephone interview that he left with Gana, another founding member of the PDP,“because the party had compromised on its vision and mission”. “Yes, we have left to be part of what is known as the Third Force. The PDP has lost its glory because Governor Wike is now running the party. “The Third Force is the integration of leaders of different political parties and their supporters. So we are now part of the emerging Third Force,” he said. Daily Trust on Sunday gathered that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed Friday, by National Leader of the SDP, Chief Olu Falae, on behalf of the SDP, while Gana signed on behalf of the aggrieved PDP leaders with the name Movement for a New Political Order. Findings revealed that aggrieved chieftains of more political parties were considering the third force as a good platform for the 2019 general elections. But it was not clear at the time of filing this report the number and names of aggrieved stalwarts of other parties joining the trail.
