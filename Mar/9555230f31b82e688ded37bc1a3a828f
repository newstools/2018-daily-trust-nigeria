The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, said community policing will boost security in the country and reduce crime in communities. The IGP who spoke  at the weekend  during the graduation ceremony of Advanced Detective Course, held at the Police Staff College in Jos, said ‎community policing would tackle crime, insurgency, hate speech and other societal ills. “The Police Force management has re-launched the Community Policing Scheme with massive campaign on robust engagement of critical stakeholders and other non-state actors, to engender public support aimed at achieving very low crime profile in our communities. These endeavors have also resulted in the establishment of Eminent Persons Forum, strengthening the Police Public Relation committees in all the commands and the regular convocation of security summits in various locations,” he said. In her remark, the Commandant of the Police Staff College, AIG Dorothy Gimba, said the college had equipped the graduating police officers with the contemporary knowledge to combat crimes especially the current farmers/herders conflicts and proliferation of small and light weapons.
