The National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion [NOTAP] has called on Nigerian innovators and inventors to protect their intellectual properties by applying for patents at the agency. NOTAP Director General Dr Dan Azumi Ibrahim made call at the NOTAP Day at the ongoing 2018 Technology and Innovation Expo in Abuja. He said apart from increasing their individuals’ intellectual wealth, protecting and promotion of IP would also spur economic development in the country. He said because of lack of patents for their inventions, many Nigerian researchers were being robbed of their inventions by some foreigners. According to him, 90 per cent of technologies being used in Nigeria are imported, depraving the country of foreign exchange. “Foreign technology owners are making urge profits at the expense of Nigerians,” Dr Ibrahim said.
