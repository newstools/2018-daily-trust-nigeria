The Sokoto Area command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has intercepted 465 packs of tramadol worth N5 million.  According to the Area Comptroller, Nasiru Ahmad, the drugs were smuggled into the country from the Neighbouring Niger Republic. Ahmed said that they were concealed in two sacks which were intercepted along Illela road last two weeks. "These are dangerous drugs which are used by our youths, leading to increased crimes in our region," he said Ahmed noted that the recent killings in part of the country, especially in Zamfara state were influenced by these kinds of drugs. "This is the biggest challenge in Nigeria. Our youths are in drugs which is everybody's concern because we owe them a duty to protect them against any harmful thing. "Therefore, we will continue tracking down drugs traffickers and other smugglers and bring them to book," he said. Ahmed explained that each of the pack contained 10 sachets and each sachet was N1000. The drugs were however, handed over to the NAFDAC for further action
