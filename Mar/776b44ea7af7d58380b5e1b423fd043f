The Northwest operational zone of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to instruct the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission to make public salaries and allowances of elective political office holders in the country. The zonal head of programmes, Nura Iro Ma’aji made the call yesterday in Kano at a press briefing during the one-day sensitization campaign against corruption organized by CISLAC in collaboration with Transparency International. The civil activist described the alleged self-allocation of jumbo allowances by the senate as disclosed by Senator Shehu Sani recently as a ‘direct circumvention of existing laws of the land’ and the highest level of corruption in governance. “We know that it is the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission that is saddle with the responsibility to determine salaries and allowances of public officials, but the recent revelation by Senator Shehu Sani alleging that the senators are allocating onto themselves jumbo allowances shows that the legislature are clearly bridging what the law says and that clearly on itself is corruption. “Not only the legislature, even the executives, that’s why we demand that the president must instruct the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission to come out and display to Nigerians the salaries and allowances of all elective political office holders in the country, if they are not going to do that it shows there are huge amount of shoddy deeds taking place in the circles of governance” he said. The activist further berated President Buhari’s administration on its zero tolerance against corruption, saying “unless the government wakes up and pursue zero tolerance against corruption most effectively the anti-graft war would always be a mere rhetoric.”
