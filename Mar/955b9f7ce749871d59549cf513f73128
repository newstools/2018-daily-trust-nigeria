The Nigeria Prisons Service (NPS) is working towards building future Nigerian leaders through its staff schools, according to the wife of the Controller-General of the Service, Hajiya Gwamma Ja'afaru.

She said this during the commissioning of the third phase of Prisons Staff School in Abuja on Monday which was built by the NPS in conjunction with the Prisons Officers Wives Association (PROWA).

Hajiya Ja'afaru, who is the National President of PROWA, said the rationale behind the project was laid to produce future leaders not only of great learning but sound character.

The National President of PROWA revealed that the building provided more classrooms to complement the existing ones, a mini conference room, a library and an administrative block for the schools.

"Our goal is to produce future leaders not only of great learning but sound character. This is the reason why we invest in expansion programmes and retaining of our teachers to adhere to best practices", she said.

She noted that the occasion was also used to empower 41 widows of officers who died in active service to the nation as a a result of the Boko Haram insurgency.

According to her, the empowerment exercise was to enable the beneficiaries start up small scale businesses in the various areas of skills to support their families.

The Controller General of Prisons, Ja'afaru Ahmed commended the project and called for more support and cooperation for PROWA to do more in the educational sector.

The CG who said education remained the bedrock for national development, disclosed that plans were underway to replicate same projects in various states' commands.
