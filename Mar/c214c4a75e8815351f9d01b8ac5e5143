Gunmen have attacked a patent medicine store and shot the vendor to death at close range in Abeokuta Street, Kaduna metropolis. A witness told Daily Trust yesterday that the gunmen came to the neigbourhood around 8.30pm on Saturday and took some drinks and snacks at a nearby shop while monitoring the movement of their target. The witness said while this was going on, the owner of the shop, Tajjudeen Adegbite, was preparing to close for the day. The witness said the gunmen moved into the shop and invited the late Tajjudeen Adegbite outside, where he was shot in his right foot and as he cried for help, they fired the second shot in his chest. “They jumped into their waiting Golf 3 car and sped off. Neighbours later called in the police who arrived at the scene and took Mr. Adegbite to a hospital where he was pronounced dead,” the witness said. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Kaduna State Command, ASP Aliyu Mukhtar, said the police received a distress call on the gun attack but that the team that was immediately dispatched arrived the location after the gunmen had fled.
