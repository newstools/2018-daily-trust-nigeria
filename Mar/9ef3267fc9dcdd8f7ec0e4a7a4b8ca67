The abducted Secretary of Kano State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Alhaji Uba Muhammad Shiye, has been freed after payment of N5 million. A reliable source at SUBEB confided in Daily Trust that Shiye was released by his abductors Monday evening after the N5 million ransom was paid. The kidnappers had earlier demanded N20 million from the family of the abducted secretary. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Magaji Musa Majia, confirmed the release of the secretary but said he was not sure whether a ransom was paid to the abductors. “Our operatives are still in the bush and they are the people who can confirm the issue of ransom to us. So, as soon as they return, I will get the details and communicate to the press,” he said.
