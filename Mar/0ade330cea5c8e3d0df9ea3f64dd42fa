A chieftain of the APC in Osun State, Chief Jackson Lekan Ojo, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to reshuffle his cabinet to gain the confidence of Nigerians. Ojo said President Buhari meant well for Nigeria but that the cabinet he had in place was sabotaging his effort. Ojo who made this known in a statement he issued to newsmen in Abuja, said the buck, however, stopped at the president’s table which was why he was facing the heat from Nigerians. “The president is the head of government of the federation. Decisions taken by the Federal Government; whether positive or negative, will be blamed on the president. “To be honest, President Buhari means well for Nigeria and Nigerians, but he can only do what a great man can do; but what are the contributions of his members of cabinet?” he asked.
