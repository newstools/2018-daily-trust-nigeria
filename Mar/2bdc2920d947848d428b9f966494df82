The Senate yesterday lifted ban on confirmation of President Muhammadu Buhari’s nominees for deputy governors of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and four members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The confirmation has been pending since last year over a remark by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr Ibrahim Magu. The Senate resolved to confirm the nominees following a motion by Senator Rafiu Ibrahim (APC, Kwara). Those to benefit from the resolution are, Aisha Ahmad (Deputy Governor), Edward Adamu (Deputy Governor) and four members of the MPC namely, Professor Adeola Festus Adenikinju; Dr Aliyu Rafindadi Sanusi; Dr Robert Chikwendu Asogwa and Dr Asheikh A. Maidugu. Aside these nominees, the confirmation of 40 others have been pending in the Senate. In moving the motion, Ibrahim told Senate that the ban on the confirmation has affected the operation of the CBN and urged his colleagues to lift it.  He said the MPC was made up of 12 members; seven from the private sector and five from the CBN. “As at today, only three of them are valid.  The tenure of all other members of the MPC has expired in December last year and culminated into the MPC meeting not being held in January (22ndand 23rd) and the next meeting is March 19 &20. In his remark, Senate President Bukola Saraki said “This has been a chamber that has always been for the issue of the economy. And for us to do all it takes to continue to ensure we see investments, ease of doing business and give confidence. Inasmuch as we continue to defend the institutions and the constitution, it is time we look at the priorities and understand what is important.”
