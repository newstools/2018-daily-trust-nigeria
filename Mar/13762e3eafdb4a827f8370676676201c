An FCT High Court in Jabi has today granted bail to Maryam Sanda, accused by the police of killing her husband. Justice Yusuf Halilu, granted the motion for bail this morning after rejecting same on three previous occasions. After the court struck out Maryam’s last bail application on February 6, the matter was adjourned to March 19 for definite hearing. However, Maryam’s counsel, Chief Joseph Daudu (SAN) approached the court with the fresh bail application and asked for an earlier date to move it. Counsel to the police, CSP James Idachaba, again opposed to the granting of the bail. However, Justice Halilu said the court was satisfied with the health reasons canvassed for Maryam, who is said to be over three months pregnant and also asthmatic. The judge held that the police were not able to counter the claims that the prisons’ health facilities could not take care of Maryam’s conditions. Justice Halilu ruled that Maryam should provide two sureties who must deposit their titles of ownership of landed properties in Abuja. He also ordered that Maryam’s father should enter into an undertaking to always provide her in court all through the trial.
