The National Patriots’ Forum has decried the alleged campaign of calumny targeted at the former acting Director General of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Ambassador Muhammed Dauda by some desperate elements. In a statement by the forum’s national president Comrade Isa Tijjani, and national publicity secretary Madu Musa Gwary, they said the campaign is aimed at rubbishing the 34 years “meritorious service of the ambassador” . The statement said the illicit campaign was recently carried out by a publisher of an Abuja-based news magazine in a report replete with half-truths, fictions, guesswork, and wild imaginations. The patriots said one of campaigns was the “the seeming moral puritanism by a so-called journalist and publisher of a third rated magazine, where he tried to paint and dramatize a scene of attempts to court his professional services in the debacle at the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), which amounts to living in a glass house and yet throwing stones.” They said, “much as it was not surprising it can be said to be bemusing, as the publisher we know lacks the professional and intellectual competence to offer any such services and could not have been sought after.” The civil society said  they have been “involved from the on start and we can see through the publisher’s lies and half-truths, wherein he tried to cast aspersions on the personalities of highly respected professionals and people of integrity while elevating himself onto professional and moral high grounds.” The statement said “for the same character who had tried to induce our national president, Comrade Isa Tijani, to back down on his fight for justice in governance, even with a promise to connect him to the incumbent Director-General of the NIA, only to turn around and accuse others portrays him as a man Friday, who is the least morally qualified to preach ethics in a profession which he gatecrashed.” The NGO said as the first group to bring to the fore the anomalies and the attendant intrigues in the appointment of the substantive director general of the NIA, 'it behooves on us to point out the seeming desperate antics being employed by the said publisher in his bid to satisfy his paymasters, even at the cost of sacrificing his professional ethics'.
