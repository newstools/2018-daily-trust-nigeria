Members of Soroptimist International, Asokoro, have donated instructional materials, food and other items to the FCT School for the Blind, Jabi. The President-elect of the club, Dr. Victoria Pillah, said the donation was part of the group’s aim to educate, enable and empower women and girls with a view to inspiring action and transforming lives. “We are elated to be here because we have found the need to support this special school with some of their most valuable items,” she said. She said the group visited the school having understood that government should not be left alone in providing for the needs of the pupils. “We brought their most valued items so that they can be used to train them, and by training them, we are affecting the society positively,” she said. Among items donated to the school were mobility canes (sticks), textbooks, braille papers and food items. The school’s Head Girl, Jacinta Odili, who spoke on behalf of the pupils, thanked the group for the items. “They have come to show us love and with their coming they have told us that we are not alone,” she said.
