The collaboration between the police and Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) has been instrumental in bursting crimes in Apo, Abuja. The chairman of PCRC, Apo Division, Princess Ngozi Nana, while acknowledging the gains of the collaboration, said the committee has had a cordial working relationship with various divisional police officers at the Apo division. Princess Nana spoke at theÂ  ground-breaking ceremony of an administrative block being constructed by the PCRC for the police division in Apo. The Federal Capital Territory Command Chairman of the PCRC, Professor Nick Ezeh, performed the ground-breaking ceremony. A resident of Apo, who is also a member of the Committee, Mr Shettima Gana Mohammed, said Apo had been a flashpoint for robbers and gangsters, a challenge that necessitated the formation of the Apo Division of the PCRC to help the police in curbing crimes. Mohammed told our reporter that community involvement in policing is potent in checking criminals as people in the community are usually the first to witness crimes before the police are called in. He said when the community was involved in policing, crimes could be stopped proactively even before the illegality was committed.
