A Federal High Court in Abuja has discharged a suspended judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Sylvester Ngwuta, on a 13 count charge of money laundering. Justice John Tsoho yesterday held that the federal government did not fulfill the condition precedent for filing criminal charges against judicial officers. Justice Ngwuta was arraigned on charges of money laundering, false age declaration and possession of multiple diplomatic passports. The defence counsel, Kanu Agabi (SAN), had in an application to discharge the judge argued that the court lacked the jurisdiction to continue with the trial in view of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Lagos which upheld the constitutional provisions on the powers of the National Judicial Council (NJC) over judicial officers.
