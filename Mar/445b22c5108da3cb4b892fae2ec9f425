The Minister of Transportation, Chief Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, has asked people of the South East to embrace the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to ensure that their interests are adequately protected. Amaechi, who said this while delivering the convocation lecture of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK), Awka, entitled, ‘The Igbo in The Politics of Nigeria’, added that it is only the APC that could guarantee the emergence of a president of Igbo extraction. The minister said sticking to the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), which he described as a regional party, would not guarantee their quest for the nation’s presidency. He said it would only further push them far away from governance. Amaechi said most of the projects abandoned by the 16 years of PDP rule had been revived by the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, including roads and railways. He added that the on-going projects across the South East were clear testimonies that Igbos were not marginalised by the present administration as erroneously believed, insisting that Buhari meant well for the Igbos.
