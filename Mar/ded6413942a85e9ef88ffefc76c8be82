The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has appointed 12 new special assistants. Candido, while inaugurating the new special assistants with three other appointees, urged them to make service their priority. Candido, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Dayo Lawal, said their appointments were meant to add value to governance and widen the revenue base of the council. “I just want to say that the appointment is not just for your own, it is a call to serve the people of Abuja Municipal Area Council, and you must put in your best to justify the confidence bestowed on you,” he said. While responding on behalf of appointees, Samuel Iloh, the Special Assistant to the Chairman on Private Public Partnership Projects, thanked him for the opportunity given to them to serve and promised to put in their best and not to disappoint the chairman in the discharge of their assignments.
