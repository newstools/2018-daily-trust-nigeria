The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has said it was wrong for the FCT Administration to demolish a market at Gosa, along Airport road. A statement by the party’s state publicity secretary, Joisie Itoyah-Splendor, said it was absolute madness that the APC-led government demolished such a prominent market of the natives and still went ahead to brutalize protesters. He said it was hard enough that the natives were barely pulling through the economic hardship introduced by the APC government and also went ahead to completely take away their last place of economic resort. “It is on this premise that the PDP in the FCT strongly condemns this act and calls for the FCT government to immediately take action in revisiting this unfortunate occurrence,” he said. The party, therefore, sympathised with the families of those that were “manhandled and humiliated, while praying for God to heal those that were injured.”
