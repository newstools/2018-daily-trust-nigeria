The Lagos Water Corporation has kicked off a ‘Free Water Test’ in the state as part of activities marking this year’s World Water Day, which started on Tuesday. The free test will cover eight operational regions, and the entire state will be divided to four areas for easy accessibility. The Corporation also unveiled the Lagos State members of the Children Parliament as water ambassadors, as part of the Water Day. The LWC Chief Operating Officer, Engineer Deji Johnson, in a chat with newsmen, condemned borehole water as contaminated water, while enjoining Lagosians to connect to the Corporation’s water, which he described as “the only safe and germ-free water with a credible source” that public conforms with the World Health Organization standard. On the unveiling of Children Parliament members as water ambassadors, he explained that globally, children were the most affected by water crises, saying the ambassadors would serve as the mouthpiece of the Corporation as its staff members cannot be on the streets all the time. The LWC chief stressed that the choice of the children as water ambassadors was also in line with the state government’s vision of developing the children, who are mostly secondary schools students, for future leadership positions. He said a road show would be held today to further sensitize residents of the state on the conservation of water and its judicious use, and on procedures to connect to LWC water.
