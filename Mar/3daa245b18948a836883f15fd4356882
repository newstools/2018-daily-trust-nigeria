The Edo State Director, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Mr. Omoragbon Wellington, has said that most farmers in the country are unable to access credit facilities due to their inability to write good business proposals. Wellington stated this in Benin on Friday, during the flag-off of the 2018 farming season and sixth anniversary of the Edo State Forum of Farmers’ in Benin. “Poor record keeping and financial management, inability to write good proposals and organise themselves in cooperatives have prevented farmers from getting access to credit facilities. There are so many facilities that farmers can access to improve their yields but it is difficult for them to get such facilities with faulty proposals”, he said. President of the Forum, Edo State chapter, Frederick Thomas, appealed to the government to build standard warehousing facilities in the three senatorial districts of the state to help farmers in the storage of farm produce.
