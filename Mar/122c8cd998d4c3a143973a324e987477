A High Court judge in Kenya has fined Interior Minister Fred Matiang’i and police chief Joseph Boinnet 200,000 Kenyan shillings ($2,000; £1,600) for contempt of court. A similar fine was imposed on the head of immigration. Judge George Odunga ordered the money be deducted from the salaries of the three. He had on Wednesday ruled that the senior government officials should appear in court for sentencing, but they did not do so. He had earlier found them in contempt for failing to obey a court order to release detained opposition politician Miguna Miguna.
