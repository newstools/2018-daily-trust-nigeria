The wife of the president, Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, has called on all stakeholders to double their efforts to end tuberculosis in Nigeria. Mrs Buhari said this on Friday on the occasion of the 2018  World TB Day. "Let us work together to end Tuberculosis in Nigeria," Mrs Buhari, a global TB champion and ambassador, said. She said tuberculosis continued to be a major global health challenge as women and children continued to die needless deaths from the preventable and curable disease. "TB is curable and treatable. TB Test and Treatment are Free in Nigeria. I therefore ask all Nigerians and everyone living in Nigeria to FIND TB AND TREAT TB. "Therefore, anyone who has been coughing persistently for more than 2 weeks should visit the nearest health center to get tested," she said.
