The Commissioner of Police in Benue State, Fatai Owoseni, has said the command would enforce the state’s anti-grazing law. Owoseni said this on Tuesday when he visited three of the Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs) in Guma and Makurdi areas of the state. “As I speak, more than 50 people have been arrested for violating the law; three of them have been sentenced to jail already,” he said at one of the camps. Owoseni further assured them that the command will provide security for the IDPs who are intending to go back to their homes. Earlier, the chairman in one of IDPs camp, Philip Usartse, alleged that the exercise Ayem Akpatuma recently launched by the military appeared to have provided a shield for more herders to come and take over their land as they had been seen grazing their animals openly. But the police commissioner dispelled the allegation.
