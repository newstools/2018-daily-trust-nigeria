The National Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, has urged Nigerians to use the occasion of Easter to reflect on the situation in the country and pray for the survival of the nation’s democracy. Secondus in a statement yesterday by his Special Adviser on Media, Ike Abonyi, said the nation’s democracy was under heavy stress and needed to be rescued. “Indicators are apparent that the country is under siege and Nigerians should use this solemn period of Easter to pray for God to intervene and raise good leaders for the country,” he said. Similarly, a former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar in a statement by his media office yesterday encouraged Nigerian leaders to use the opportunity of Easter to reflect on their stewardship to their people and to the nation. Also, the Director-General, National Orientation Agency (NOA) Dr Garba Abari in an Easter message issued by the agency’s head of media, Paul Odenyi, called on Nigerians to imbibe the virtues of selflessness and sacrifice towards a better nation.
