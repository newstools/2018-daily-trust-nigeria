The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called on the Nigerian government and other countries in the region to scale up domestic funding for tuberculosis control. In a statement to mark this year’s World Tuberculosis Day, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa urged them to take responsibility for essential medicines and laboratory supplies. She enjoined governments, parliamentarians and policy-makers to drive ambitious plans that would accelerate TB control at national level, adding that leaders have tremendous influence to build strong partnerships and commitment to end the TB epidemic at every level. She also called on health workers, nongovernmental organizations and technicians to maximize the use of proven methods to diagnose and successfully treat all types of TB. In addition she said researchers should do the scientific studies needed to inform policies to help improve and monitor TB services. “Since TB is found in communities where human rights and dignity are often overlooked, governments should lead actions beyond the health sector to address environmental, economic and other factors which increase the risk of TB,” she said.
