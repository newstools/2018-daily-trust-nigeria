Natives of Kpaduma in Asokoro Extension, Abuja, have urged developers to stay away from their communities pending the determination of the case between them and the FCT Administration which is already in court. The leaders of the communities in a resolution after an emergency meeting said they would resist any allocation within the centre of their ancestral homes and environs. They urged developers to request for an alternative allocation from the FCT minister. In the resolution signed by Bala Iyah, Maji Dadi of Kpaduma communities, Simon Baba, Secretary General of the communities and Dantani Bawa, Community youth leader, the natives stated that they have never been compensated by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), therefore, they would not tolerate any group of persons, organisation or individual that would want to intimidate them and forcefully takeover their land. “Kpaduma communities hereby inform all developers to stop parading, harassing and intimidating our people with armed security personnel, as we are not and will never be ready for settlement with any individual, organization or developers. We are Nigerians and we deserve to be treated equally as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution as amended. “We want to state clearly that even if the allocation papers given to any developer is revoked or not, we will not allow anybody to take possession of our community land without the settlement from the government. Enough is enough. “We also want to draw the attention of the security agencies that the issue between Kpaduma communities and land developers is not and can never be a security threat nor be treated as criminal issue. It is purely a civil matter that can be addressed and settled in the civil court of law,” the resolution read.
