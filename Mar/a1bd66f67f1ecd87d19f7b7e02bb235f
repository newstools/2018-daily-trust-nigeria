The Lagos State Police Command has arrested a 60-year-old resident of Adeniji Street, Iyana Ishashi area of the state, Stephen Uwa, for the death of his lover, 45-year-old Joy Vincent.

It was gathered that Vincent had visited the suspect in his house last Sunday.

He was alleged to have returned her dead to her house on Osha Arigba Street, Imude, and fled.

But Uwa, who was arrested the following day, claimed that she was unconscious when he took her home.

It was gathered that Uwa and three others had on Thursday brought the woman in a vehicle, but did not meet anybody at home.

A woman, who sold confectionery on the street, was said to have helped the suspect to call one of the deceased’s children, Ikechukwu, from school.

When Ikechukwu arrived, Uwa was said to have collected the keys to her apartment from him and asked him to go call his aunt, who lived some distance away.

The family was said to have met her dead body in the house.

However, Uwa told the police that Vincent arrived in his house on Sunday, adding that when they woke up together on Thursday, she complained of stomach pain and asked that she be taken to her house.

He added that as of the time he took her home, she was alive, but unconscious.

The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Chike Oti, who confirmed the incident, said the corpse had been deposited in the Badagry General Hospital mortuary for autopsy.

He said, “The woman had about four children. Her sister reported that Stephen (Uwa) dropped her on the bed covered with clothes and left without telling anybody anything. She said she discovered that her sister was dead.

“Investigation is ongoing. The suspect will be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba, for further investigation.”
