The International Media Centre has called for a legislation that will compel civil servants to set aside a day for use of mother tongue as official language across Nigeria. The centre said it was not against the use of English Language as Lingua-franca, but insisted that there must be a space for the promotion of mother tongue to save the country’s rich cultural heritage from extinction. Speaking with journalists on the side line of the 8th annual public lecture of the centre on mother tongue in Ilorin, the convener, Jolaolu Afolabi (aka Jabulani) praised Lagos State government for taking the lead in that direction. Afolabi, who is a radio broadcaster, said there was the need for other state of assemblies to follow suit by setting aside a day for the promotion of mother tongue. The convener said the essence of the annual lecture being organised by the centre was to raise the advocacy for speaking of mother tongue which was “fast eroding”. Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, represented at by the Magajin Nda of Ilorin, Alhaji Saliu Woru Mohammed, urged parents and guardians to raise their children and wards in a manner that they will grow to understand their indigenous culture and tradition.
