A housewife in Birnin Kebbi, the Kebbi State capital, has reportedly set her husband’s house on fire because he plans to marry a second wife. It was gathered that the woman, whose name was given as Zainab, in the early hours of yesterday, became angry over the arrangements her husband was making to take a second wife. It was further gathered that the husband whose name was given as Yunusa, had planned to marry a lady called Aisha at the weekend. Informed of the plan, Zainab allegedly decided to burn down their residential apartment located at Badariya area of Birnin Kebbi. A source close to the husband said nobody thought she could resort to burning down her husband’s house because he was to take a second wife because she was also involved in the wedding plan. He said, “We were shocked to see the house in flames and she was responsible for it because of the second wedding her husband was planning for the weekend.” When contacted, Kebbi State police spokesperson, DSP Mustapha Suleiman, said the matter was yet to be reported at any of the police stations in Kebbi.
