Saudi forces say they have shot down seven missiles launched into Saudi territory by Houthi rebels in Yemen. Three of the missiles were fired at the capital Riyadh on Sunday night, and an Egyptian man was killed when fragments landed in a suburb, officials say. Sunday was the third anniversary of the intervention by a Saudi-led coalition in the conflict in Yemen. The Houthis said they had been aiming at a number of locations, including Riyadh’s international airport. The coalition accuses Iran of supplying the rebels with the missiles - a claim denied by Tehran, which says the launches are “independent actions”.
