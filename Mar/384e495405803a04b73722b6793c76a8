German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to form her fourth government after the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) voted in favour of another grand coalition. The vote by 464,000 rank-and-file members ends five months of political deadlock since September’s election. The SPD had been split between the party’s leadership, which backed joining the coalition, and its radical youth wing, which did not. Mrs Merkel, who has been in power for 12 years, congratulated the SPD. On her party’s Twitter feed. she said she “looks forward to working together again for the benefit of our country”. SPD voters approved continuing the coalition with 66% in favour. The party leadership had been concerned younger voters might veto a deal. Vote counting went on through the night at the party headquarters in Berlin.
