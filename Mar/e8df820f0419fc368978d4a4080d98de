The Director General, Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Dr. Mansur Liman, said the Frequency Modulated Band (FM) station established in Potiskum town would counter terrorism in Yobe and other northeastern states. The DG who commissioned the FM station on Sunday, said the project was made possible by the intervention of the Northeast Regional Initiative (NERI). He said the initiative by NERI would be effectively utilized to counter Boko Haram insurgency and other forms of violence that adversely affected the northeast sub-region. The station, named Sunshine FM, started test running last month. The FRCN Zonal Director, Abdullahi Maikano, while thanking NERI for all the support given for the FM station to takeoff, appealed to the people of the state to patronize the station as a way of complimenting the efforts of the government. Daily Trust gathered that the station was supposed to commence transmission some years ago but could not do so due to paucity of fund and Boko Haram insurgency but NERI renovated the structure, supplied equipment and paid for the installation.
