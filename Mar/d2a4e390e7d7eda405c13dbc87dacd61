Many flights out of the Murtala Muhammed Airport Ikeja Lagos yesterday were delayed following the blockage of the road leading to the domestic terminal arising from the two - day official visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to Lagos. Daily Trust reports that one of the areas affected by traffic diversion is the Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way connecting the local airport from Maryland. It was therefore impossible for many passengers with flights to catch to get to the airports on time as vehicular movement was restricted. It was learnt that as early as 6:00 a.m, the diversion has been effected by armed security operatives and traffic officials. Passengers were seen trekking to the airport with luggage on their heads. This prompted airlines to adjust their flights as many passengers were trapped on roads where traffic was diverted to. However, the road was reopened around 11:30 a.m when the President concluded the commissioning of the Ikeja Bus Terminal constructed by the Lagos State Government. Air Peace spokesman, Chris Iwarah said, “Reports reaching us say most of our guests are trapped in the huge traffic jam caused by the multiple diversions in Lagos. Since Lagos is our base, we had no choice than to consider their challenge…The situation is, however, causing huge disruptions in our operations.” Also speaking Dana Air spokesman, Mr. Kingsley Ezenwa said despite the disruptions, the airline managed to accommodate all their passengers with their multiple flights out of Lagos. The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) had earlier informed passengers, airport users and the general public that commercial vehicles will only operate from 7am-7pm around the Murtala Muhammed Airport yesterday as a result of the visit. In other parts of Lagos especially the roads leading to Eko Hotel where Buhari attended the colloquium in honour of former Governor of the state, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, many Lagosians trekked to their destinations owing to the vehicular restriction.
