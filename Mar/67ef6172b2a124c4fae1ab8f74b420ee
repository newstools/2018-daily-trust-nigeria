The body of a yet to be identified man was found dangling on top of a hanging transformer in Barnawa area of Kaduna State, early yesterday. The man was said to have been electrocuted while attempting to vandalize the transformer supplying electricity to Barnawa High Cost area when his feet touched one of the cables in his attempt to gain balance to cut the line. Residents woke up to see the body dangling from the transformer and people gathered to catch a glimpse of the body as early as 6:30 am. Some residents said they heard a loud bang around early in the morning and the whole area went dark. Kaduna Electric confirmed the incident. “We continue to warn that tampering with electrical equipment is very dangerous and could lead to loss of life. It is also one of the reasons why steady power supply has been unattainable. Let us work together to curb the menace of vandalism,” said Abdulaziz Abdullahi, the head of corporate affairs division of the firm.
