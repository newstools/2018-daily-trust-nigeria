Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will speak at London’s Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House, on April 25. The keynote speech entitled “The Importance of Strengthening State Economic Management Systems” will unveil innovative and tangible solutions that if implemented will help Nigerian states come out of their current economic challenges. In a statement by Paul Ibe of the Atiku Media Organisation, during the trip, the former Vice President will give another speech at the Invest Africa and British Council for Africa “Annual Debate.” He will be speaking alongside Dr Liam Fox, International Trade Secretary, UK Government, on the subject of “Building new trade partnerships in Africa.” Atiku’s engagements are a follow-up to the meeting in June last year with Fox and Prime Minister Theresa May where they discussed the UK’s plan to increase trade with Nigeria post Brexit. During the trip, Atiku will be the guest of honour at an event on Nigerian inward investment hosted by former UK Minister for Africa, Lord Anthony St John and at a Round Table of key UK business leaders interested in investing in Nigeria at the Institute of Directors, Pall Mall.
