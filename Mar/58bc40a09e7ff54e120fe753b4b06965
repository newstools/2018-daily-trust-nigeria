The Governor of Ebonyi state, Engr. David Umahi proposed anti-open grazing law which forbids night grazing and illegal migration of herders to the state. The bill which is still in pipeline would also sentence parents of underage children to jail for failure to send their wards to school. He also noted that the law accepts grazing with stick but not with weapons such as machete or gun. Umahi made this known on Wednesday when he met the leadership of Miyetti Allah in Abakaliki. This came following reports that two herdsmen in the earlier hours of Monday killed three persons and wounded dozens in Igbagu, Izzi local government area of the state. It was also alleged that rapes cases, disruption of crops were orchestrated by herders in Onicha local government area of the state.
