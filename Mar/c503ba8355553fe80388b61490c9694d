A drama ensued at the Government House Lokoja yesterday following the announcement of cabinet dissolution by Governor Yahaya Bello and subsequent reversal of the same decision moments later. The governor had summoned a meeting of his appointees at the Government House where he directed 15 of his commissioners and 21 local government administrators to hand over keys of their official vehicles to the Secretary to the State Government and Directors of Local Government (DLGs) respectively. However, some minutes later,  the governor reversed his decision to sack members of his cabinet and the 21 local government administrators. Sources privy to the meeting informed that the governor rather charged the affected officials to sit up and be more productive in the discharge of their duties. It was not clear what would have necessitated the decision of the governor to suddenly reverse his earlier directive on the sack of the officials. The Director General on Media and Publicity to the governor, Mr. Kingsley Fanwo merely said, “The governor has reversed himself on the directive on dissolution” but did not give any reason for the development.
