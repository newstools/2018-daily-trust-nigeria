The Islamic Medical Association of Nigeria (IMAN), has offered free medical services to Kusaki Community in Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory. The medical outreach featured health talk, consultation, checkup, provision of drugs while they were treated for communicable diseases. IMAN Chairman, FCT Chapter, Dr Suleiman Ahmed, said reaching out to the less privileged in rural communities was part of the association’s way of giving back to the society.  He expressed concern that the community’s unhealthy practices, coupled with the absence of a health facility make them vulnerable to different kinds of diseases. He said the major health issues residents were diagnosed of diarrhea, malaria, typhoid, worm infestation, heartburn and skin diseases. Dr Ahmed said the distance to a health facility should not be more than five-minute drive and 30-minute trek. But the situation of the community calls for concern from all stakeholders, he added. A resident, Wakili Dikko Abubakar, commended the community members for the mass turnout and appreciated IMAN for sacrificing time and resources in the course of the community.
