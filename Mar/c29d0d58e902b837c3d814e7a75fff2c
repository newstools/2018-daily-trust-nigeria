The House of Representatives is investigating the loss of N2 billion and $3.8 million as a result of none-payment of interests by banks from proceeds of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) successor companies. The House, while adopting a motion by Deputy Minority Leader, Chukwuka Onyema, noted with concern that since the unbundling of PHCN in 2005, interests of payments made by the 18 successor companies through certain banks were not paid. Rather, the House said, the interests were alleged to have been diverted by the affected banks in collaboration with officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The House named the banks as, Standard Chartered, Fidelity Bank, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, FCMB, Skye Bank, Sterling Bank, Zenith Bank and Unity Bank. The lawmakers therefore mandated the committees on power, banking and currency as well as privatization and commercialization to investigate the matter and report back within six weeks for further legislative action.
