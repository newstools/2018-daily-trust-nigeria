Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Senator Abdullahi Adamu (APC, Nasarawa) yesterday said no amount of intimidation would stop him from supporting President Muhammadu Buhari. He said it was unfortunate that lawmakers of the All Progressives Congress were sabotaging the President. Adamu was on Thursday accused by Senator Obinna Ogba (PDP, Ebonyi) of plotting to destabilize the Senate and remove Senate President Bukola Saraki from office. Adamu in a statement he issued last night faulted Ogba’s claim. He said his crimes were the call against show of disrespect to the person and office of the President and his position on the change of election sequence. “I believe we need to retrace our steps and reconsider our stand as legislators on matters of public interest. “Our party, APC, has the majority in both chambers of the National Assembly, yet we hold the Executive prisoner of politics that are unhealthy for the polity. It is such a terrible irony that we sabotage our own government by refusing to do our part in support of the Executive. “Appointments requiring Senate approval are held up. The consequence is that the public has nicknamed the President and his administration go-slow. The people gave us the mandate as a party to deliver,” he said. “On the allegation that he was plotting Saraki’s removal, Adamu said, “ If I was interested in contesting the Senate presidency in 2015, nothing would have stopped me from doing so. I was qualified for the office. This is another naked lie to tarnish my name. Let me caution that this smear campaign against me is neither in the interest of the Senate nor of the senators.”
