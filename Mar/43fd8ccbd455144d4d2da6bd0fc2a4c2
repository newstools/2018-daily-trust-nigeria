Minister of Youth and Sports Barrister Solomon Dalung has said that Nigeria is going to the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia as serious contenders for the title, and not just mere participants. Dalung stated this in Abuja yesterday on the occasion of the arrival of the 4th edition of the FIFA World Cup Trophy tour to Abuja Nigeria. At an elaborate ceremony held inside an aircraft of the major sponsors of the FIFA World Cup, Coca-Cola, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Dalung thanked the World Cup team for their visit tipping the Super Eagles to do better than ever in Russia. “On behalf of the sports loving people of Nigeria, the government and the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, we are indeed highly elated about this tour to Nigeria. It is not coming to Nigeria by accident, but because we qualified to participate. We will go into the competition with determination, not just to make a statement but we will be going to Russia as serious contenders. “We are determined and we will do our best. We believe that those who win are humans so Nigerians will also win. We welcome you and wish you the best as you tour round the participating countries. “We also thank Coca-Cola for their partnership. We look forward to a more robust partnership that will trickle down to the grassroots because those who consume these products are ordinary Nigerians, so they need to feel the impact of this partnership,” he said.
