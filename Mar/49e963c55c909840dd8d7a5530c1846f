The curse placed on human traffickers, their collaborators, cultists and members of Community Development Associations by the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, appears to be yielding positive results. Oba Ewuare II had last week Friday assembled top sorcerers and magic-practicing priests of the kingdom at his palace grounds to place a curse on herbalists and native doctors who aid human traffickers by administering oaths of secrecy on their victims. The monarch extended the curse on cultists, kidnappers, and anyone involved in illegal trafficking of persons. Oba Ewuare II’s action followed reports by people and complaint by the Director-General of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Dame Julie Okah-Donli, that the agency found it difficult to prosecute traffickers  because the victims were not willing  to testify against their traffickers due to the oaths of secrecy administered on them. It was gathered that scores of cult members have been visiting the state High Court to depose to affidavit renouncing their membership of the various cult groups. A source at the court who pleaded anonymity said they had processed the affidavit of about 39 people renouncing their membership. It was also gathered that some traditional rulers who had secretly engaged in land racketeering after the pronouncement of ban on such activities by the Oba, are now returning lands they had forcefully occupied to their owners.
