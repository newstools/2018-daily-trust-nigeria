A former factional chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Ali Modu Sheriff, was a guest of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday, Daily Trust can report. Although details of his invitation were still sketchy, a source confided in Daily Trust that the former Borno State governor arrived at the headquarters of the EFCC around 10am and was questioned by a team of investigators for several hours before being allowed to leave. A source said Sheriff’s invitation may be in continuation of investigation over his alleged sharing of N40million during the 2015 elections. The anti-graft agency had in June last year grilled Mohammed Wallis, the 2015 PDP campaign coordinator for Borno State, who reportedly revealed how the sum of N450million was shared. Spokesman of the EFCC confirmed to Daily Trust that Sheriff was a guest at their headquarters but said he had no further details.
