Two Immigration officers suspected to be working for a human trafficking syndicate were on Thursday busted at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos. The two officers were arrested for allegedly facilitating six under-aged girls to Omar and Kuwait on Ethiopian airlines. It was gathered that the immigration officers were arrested by Aviation Security (AVSEC) personnel,   who were on surveillance at the departure hall of the international wing of Lagos airport. Sources at the airport confirmed that the immigration officers have been handed over to the National Agency for Prohibition of Traffic in persons (NAPTIP) for further investigation. The spokesman for the Nigeria Immigration Services, James Sunday said though there has not been any official communication on the incident, the Immigration Comptroller General, Muhammed Babandede had been briefed and had ordered thorough investigation against them. Sunday noted that if said  story is confirmed to be true, appropriate disciplinary action would be meted on the officers. He said, “Yes the Comptroller General has been briefed about the development but we have not received any official report to that effect. Until after a thorough investigation is done on it before the CGI would now direct on what would be done on it. He does not condone any act of indiscipline. If any officer is found to be involved in it definitely appropriate action would be meted on him there is no doubt about it”. Also spokesman of the Lagos Airport Police Command confirmed that NAPTIP is handling the issue. NAPTIP’s Head of Public Affairs, Mr. Josiah Emerole did not also respond to our correspondent’s enquiry as of the time of filing this report.
