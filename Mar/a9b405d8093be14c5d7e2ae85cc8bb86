Senate President Bukola Saraki yesterday condoled with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, over the death of his father in-law, Dr. Christopher Abebe. Abebe, who was the first indigenous Chairman and Managing Director of United Africa Company (UAC), was the father of Obasanjo’s late wife, Stella. Saraki, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, urged the ex-President, the Abebe family and the government and people of Edo State to take solace in the fact that Abebe lived a life worthy of emulation. He described the late elder statesman as a board room guru and quintessential public servant who carried out his private and public responsibilities diligently and with utmost integrity.
