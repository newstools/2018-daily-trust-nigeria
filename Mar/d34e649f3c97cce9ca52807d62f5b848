The Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Professor Is-haq Oloyede yesterday said 1,662,762 candidates will write the 2018 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) between March 9 and 19. He made the statement at a media conference in Bwari, Abuja. He said the Computer Based Test (CBT) would hold in 605 centres nationwide and candidates must adhere strictly to the date and time given to them “as any candidate who fails to turn up on schedule automatically misses the examination.” He said a total of 367 blind candidates would take the tests as against the 201 last year and that the board would provide necessary support to physically challenged candidates. He said 1,662,762 candidates registered for the test this year as against 1,718,425 last year which represented the decrease of 3.2 percent. “The drop in the number of candidates for this year’s UTME is largely due to the measures put in place to forestall multiple registration and other unwholesome registration practices by candidates,” he said. Professor Oloyede warned candidates and parents not to patronise any fraudulent individual or syndicate.
