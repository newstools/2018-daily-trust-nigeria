The Edo State Police Command yesterday killed a suspected kidnapper during a gun battle in Benin, the Edo State capital. Addressing journalists in Benin, the state Commissioner of Police, Babatunde Johnson Kokumo, said the suspect was killed by police operatives in the early hours of yesterday. Daily Trust gathered that previously, kidnappers numbering four seized one Odion while he was entering his compound on the Sapele road, Benin. “On getting the information (of Odion’s abduction) we trailed the suspects and when our men came in close contact with them this morning at Ugbo area of Benin, they engaged the police in a gun battle and one of them was gunned down while three others escaped,” he said. Speaking with journalists, the victim said the armed men accosted him with gun, axes and cutlasses and ordered him to give them money. He said, “When I told them that I didn’t have money, they ordered me out of the car and drove me away. They collected the little money on me and ATM card. They took me to an uncompleted building.”
