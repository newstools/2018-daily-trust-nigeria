The publisher, BusinessDay, Mr Frank Aigbogun said the future of good journalism was one that pays for itself. Aigbogun who was one of the panel of discussants at the Daily Trust 20th Anniversary celebration in Abuja yesterday stressed the need to redefine the mission of journalism in Nigeria today. “In my view, the future that I see is the future of journalism that pays for itself. I believe that journalists need to redefine their mission,” he said. Sharing his experience at BusinessDay, he said: “in January last year, we put a pay wall on our website and for a year and three months, we have seen digital subscriptions equate with our hard copy subscriptions and we are sure that by the end of this year, we will double our hard copy and digital subscriptions.” According to him, one of the greatest disservice to journalism was to suggest that journalism can be sustained by money that has been made or was been made elsewhere noting that “for me, that is the greatest disservice that we can do to journalism.” Aigbogun while citing successes of newspapers in South Africa and US said “if you go to Johannesburg, South Africa, the Sunday Times of Johannesburg still circulates 450,000 to 500,000 every Sunday, and South Africa is a smaller country than Nigeria.
