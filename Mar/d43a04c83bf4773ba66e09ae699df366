Presidential spokesman Mr Femi Adesina has said Buhari does not decide on where he visits, but the would-be hosts and his protocol staff do so. "It is a different setting. You do your own thing according to your own country. You do not have to be a copycat. When the President visits a place like that, the hosts along with the President’s protocol people draw up programmes and agree on the places where the President will go. So, it is not as if the President will just say 'this is where I will go.' It is a concerted thing.” "It simply tells you that the President is not omniscient. No human being is omniscient; it is only God, because he knows all things. The President said last week that he has his channels of getting information apart from security reports he receives as President, but it does not mean that he gets every information under the sun. Even in the best countries in the world, the super powers, there are still security breaches," Adesina said. On why killings continued after the president had visited some of the places, the presidential spokesman said security is a collective responsibility.  "It is not the responsibility of the President alone. What Nigerians expect is that everything should flow from the top which is not correct. It should rather flow from the bottom up. Security is the responsibility of people from the wards to the local government, traditional rulers, states governors and up to the Federal.”  "The Tor Tiv said it yesterday that he believed now that traditional rulers should be given constitutional roles so that they can be part of the security apparatus. He called for a reordering of the security architecture in the country and it makes a lot of sense. Whatever is going to be done to solve this security we now have in an enduring manner, the President will do."
