The Federal Government has said the menace of illegal mining across the country is an impediment to investment opportunities as well as a threat to government’s effort at diversifying the economy. The Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development said during the 2nd phase of a five-day capacity building workshop for ‘Special Mines Surveillance Task Force (SMSTF) on Illegal Mining in Nigeria’ that despite the establishment of the taskforce in 2012, it had been unable to deliver its mandate due to challenges of funds, which he said had led to an upsurge of illegal mining activities across states of the federation, particularly Ebonyi, Plateau, Oyo, Niger, Taraba and Zamfara states. The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dr. Abdulkadir Mu’azu who was represented by a director in the ministry, Eng. Karnap Wuyep, said with the need to resuscitate the taskforce in 2017, it had been charged with curbing illegal mining, reducing environmental degradation and blocking of revenue leakages. The capacity building workshop is taking place at the Nigeria Institute of Mining and Geosciences in Jos.
