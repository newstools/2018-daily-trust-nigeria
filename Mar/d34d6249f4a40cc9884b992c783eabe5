The National Centre for Energy and Environment (NCEE) has called on all tiers of government to adequately fund energy research, development, production and distribution in order to meet the nationâ€™s quest for sustainable energy. The director of the centre, Professor Sunday Ogbonmwan, made the call in Benin yesterday at sensitization programme on energy and environmental management organised by NCEE in collaboration with Aloton Global Integrated Resources. He said the call became necessary in order to achieve a breakthrough in the quest for renewable energy that is ecofriendly. The Vice Chancellor, University of Benin, Prof. Faraday Orunmwense, said the nation could no longer depend on one source if the energy demand of the country must be met.
