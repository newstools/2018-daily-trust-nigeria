Experts have called on lawmakers to increase efforts towards making healthcare services accessible to Nigerians. They gave the advice yesterday in Abuja during a capacity development workshop for legislators organized by the Legislative Network for Universal Health Coverage in Abuja. Chief of party, Health Finance and Governance Project, Gafar Alawode, said lawmakers were important in Universal Health Coverage because they play important role in terms of appropriation, accountability, oversight, and representation, which are their statutory functions. “All these are needed to get more money for health, get necessary legal frameworks, and efficiency in the utilization of resources .That is why we brought them together with other stakeholders on how to use their statutory role to achieve Universal Health Coverage,” he said. He said achieving universal health coverage requires all stakeholders in the health sector and outside the health sector. Alawode said since the launch of the legislative network in July last year, more lawmakers in the states have been working towards  increasing budgetary allocation to health, doing more oversight to ensure money released was used properly , among others , and that there was room for improvement. Representative of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Ajodi Nuhu said there was need for decentralisation of health insurance to the states, as well as legislative framework for health insurance implementation. He said health insurance should be made compulsory in order to ensure coverage for all categories of citizens. Earlier, Senator Dino Melaye called on the populace to ask questions and hold government accountable on quality healthcare delivery.
