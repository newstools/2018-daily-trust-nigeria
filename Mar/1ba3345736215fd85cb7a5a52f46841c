A 30-year-old woman, Blessing Okereke, is standing trial for threatening to kill a policeman at the port. Okereke, who was docked on Tuesday at the Apapa chief magistrate’s court, was accused of threatening the life of a police Inspector, Dauda Abiodun, at the Tin Can Island port, Lagos. The accused, a food vendor, is facing a count charge bordering on assault. The prosecutor, Alexander Esebamen, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on March 16, 2018 at about 8:30am. Esebamen said, “The defendant threatened the life of Inspector Dauda Abiodun, a member of the Nigeria Police Force attached to the Roro police station, while he was performing his lawful duty.” Okereke, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Magistrate O.S. Abioye granted him bail in the sum of N100,000 with “one responsible surety,” who he said must furnish the court with evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State government and his residential address verified. He adjourned the case till April 12, 2018 for mention.
