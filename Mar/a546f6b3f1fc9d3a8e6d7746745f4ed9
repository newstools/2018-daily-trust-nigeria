A staff of the office of the Accountant General of the Federation has been jailed for leaking sensitive government documents.  A Magistrate Court 18, sitting in Abuja, sentenced Aminu Maru, an accountant seconded to the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), to one year in prison for illegal disclosure of official documents.  Maru was however granted an option of paying a fine of N100,000 by the court.  The accountant was arraigned by the Department of State Security (DSS) for allegedly leaking official government documents to non-civil servants for money.  The conviction followed Maru’s guilty plea on Tuesday.  The secret service is investigating many federal civil servants over allegations of leaking sensitive government documents for financial gains.  One of the DSS official who spoke to this newspaper said in confidence that after “buying” the leaked documents, the mischief makers usually used them to blackmail top government functionaries.  The official said Maru was lucky because he “cooperated fully with investigators and promptly confessed to his crime.”  “He also pleaded guilty and that is why you can see that the judge was lenient in her ruling,” he said  He said the service “is bent in stopping that dangerous trend. Presently, we are investigating many people and more will be taken to court soon.  “We are taking this measure due to the high rise in leakage of sensitive official secrets that are capable of subverting national security,” the official said.
