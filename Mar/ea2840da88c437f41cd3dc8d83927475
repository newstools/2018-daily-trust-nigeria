The Senate will today debate allegation by a former defence minister, Lt. Gen. Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma (rtd) accusing the Nigerian Armed Forces of colluding with bandits to kill innocent citizens. The resolution followed a point of order by Senator Yusuf A. Yusuf (APC, Taraba) during plenary session yesterday. Danjuma, a former Chief of Army Staff had at the convocation ceremony of the Taraba State University on Saturday, made the allegation against the military and asked Nigerians to rise and protect themselves. Yusuf had while raising the point of order said the retired General had raised fundamental and sensitive issues that should be investigated. He sought for the approval of the Senate to sponsor a substantive motion today on the matter. When Senate President Bukola Saraki put the question on the issue, majority of senators rejected the request. Twice, Saraki repeated the question and the voice vote favoured those against, but he hit the gavel in favour of those in support of the motion.
