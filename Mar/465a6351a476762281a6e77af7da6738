As the induction of newly recruited teachers is on, the Kaduna state government has said it will go after the teachers to their various classrooms with a view to fishing out unqualified and incompetent ones who might have lobbied their way in during the recruitment exercise. The government said it will not rest on its oars until it rid the education system of unqualified and incompetent teachers. The chairman of the Kaduna State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Nasiru Umar, told Daily Trust that 15,000 applicants were given probational letters of appointment and that not all of them would be invited for the job. “The state government at the end of the examination and interview introduced another screening exercise aimed at fishing out unqualified candidates who might have lobbied their way through. During the final screening which held at all LGAs of the state, the candidates were offered their appointment letters and asked to write an acceptance letter in the presence of the panel. This was aimed at fishing out those who might have come in through the back door. “At the end, the three-man panel recommended candidates suitable and those unsuitable for the job. What we did was to delist those already found to be unsuitable. So, only the suitable candidates will be inducted. The letter offered to the candidates is probational and can be terminated at any time. The filtering process continues,” he said. It would be recalled that Governor Nasir El-rufai at a roundtable which held recently in Abuja said that some of the applicants could not write acceptance letter.
