The Controller General of Nigerian Prisons Service (NPS), Mr. Ja’afaru Ahmed, has raised the alarm over the increasing number of child offenders remanded in adult prisons across the country. He said it was disturbing that under-aged offenders, rather than being remanded in juvenile facilities, otherwise known as “borstal institutions,” were brought into prisons where, at times, they stay even much longer awaiting trial. Ahmed also said there is increasing number of lunatics and other vulnerable groups like street urchins, who were hulled into prisons without hope of adequate trials, thereby adding to prisons congestion. Ahmed made the disclosure on Wednesday through Deputy Controller of Prisons in charge of public affairs, Mr. Francis Enobore, who represented him at a joint press briefing of the Prisoners Rehabilitation and Welfare Action, PRAWA and NPS in Enugu. He, however, announced that the service is currently constructing a borstal institution (juvenile facility) at hilltop, Ngwo in Enugu North local government area of Enugu state, which has reached 75 percent completion for reformation of child offenders bellow the age of 18. In her speech, the Executive Director of PRAWA, Dr. Uju Agomuo said as at Monday this week, inmates population stands at 71,642 out of which 49,001 representing 68.4 percent are awaiting trial persons while 22, 641 representing 31.6 percent are convicted inmates and 2,322 inmates on death row.
