About 2000 residents of Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, at the weekend benefited from eye test and treatment done by the Mohammed Ajia Ibrahim (MAI) Foundation. The free eye treatment was of part of activities outlined in the medical outreach of the Foundation to help people battling with eye problems such as cataract, glaucoma and others reclaim their sights. The founder of the MAI Foundation, Alhaji Mohammed Ibrahim Ajia, who monitored the exercise, said his Foundation undertook the medical mission because most of the beneficiaries could not foot medical bill in the hospitals. Ajia stated that some of the people who turned up for the eye treatment were unaware that they were prone to eye problems, adding that his Foundation intervened and acted to prevent a worsening of their problems. He said the exercise was part of the humanitarian services of MAI Foundation to assist the masses and reduce rising cases of preventable sight problems. “In summary, those that have major issues like glaucoma, we will arrange special attention for them. Those that need surgery, we will sponsor the operation. And those that need advanced treatment, we will arrange for that too. This is the way we want to serve our people,” Ajia said. The MAI founder maintained there was no political string to what he had set out to do for the people.
