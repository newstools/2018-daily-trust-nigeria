The Nigerian Armed Forces ‎on Thursday reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the democracy of the country, stressing that it has no plans to take over governance as was being peddled in some quarters. The Defence Headquarters also added that the Armed Forces of Nigeria has been re-professionalised to be totally subordinate to political leadership and democracy in the Country. In a statement signed by the Acting Director ‎of Defence Information, Brigadier General John Agim, the Armed forces was responding to a statement attributed to Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu. Ekweremadu had on Wednesday 7 March 2018, made a statement about the military while contributing to a debate on a motion sponsored by Senator Ahmed Ogembe, representing Kogi Central. The Deputy President of the Senate was alleged to have said, “The Problem in Nigeria is that our democracy is receding. Who says army cannot take over, let us not joke with our democracy that is the issue”. The Defence Headquarters noted that ‎though the statement might appear sincere, " it is however derogatory to the Army used in the expression and by extension to the Armed Forces of Nigeria" . He added that the said statement had the capacity to denigrate the Nigerian Military in every ramification including its loyalty to the President Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and the confidence of the general public to defend Nigeria’s democracy. He stressed that the Nigerian Military has come of age and is in tune with best international military practices of complete and total subordination to democratic governance.
