A customary court sitting in Oja-Oba Mapo area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital has dissolved a two-year old marriage between Isiaka Lawal and Ganiyat Lawal over new religious belief. Ganiyat had approached the court seeking divorce from her husband for what she described as excessive “religious bigotry of her husband.” She said her husband ordered that all the table spoons in the house should be disposed because of his new faith. According to Ganiyat, her husband who was a practicing Muslim told her that his new faith (Jabata Abubeji) does not allow him to take part in any celebration and she should also avoid the use of table spoon to eat. Part of the belief according to her was for her never to respect anybody including her parents again. She noted that when it was difficult for her to cope with the new directives, her husband packed her belongings outside the house. Reacting to the allegations, Isiaka said he admitted the claims but however noted that he never ordered his wife to dispose table spoons in the house but it was true that he told her never to respect anybody as it was against the doctrine of his new faith. He pleaded to have custody of the only child in the marriage, saying his wife cannot take good care of the baby. The President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade held that since they have both confirmed to the court that there was no love between them again, the law must take its position. He ordered that Ganiya should have the custody of the child in the marriage, Awwal Lawal, adding that the defendant should pay the sum of 5,000 monthly for feeding of the child.
