The Presidency on Saturday described as both shocking and scary comments by a former Minister of Defence, Theophilus Danjuma, calling on Nigerians to defend themselves from attacks. It appealed to prominent Nigerians, who have national influence, to use their influence wisely and not continue to engage in public declarations that are likely to inflame emotional passions and threaten national security. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba, in a statement, said silence can be dignified, but sometimes it can be misinterpreted and exploited. Shehu, who though did not mention any name, stated: "It is both shocking and scary to hear the recent comments by a senior citizen calling for Nigerians to defend themselves." Shehu said the Presidency was very worried that criminal gangs would feel justified in defying legal governing and democratic institutions, and authority of legitimately elected democratic government if unrestrained pronouncements are made. He said the Presidency commended the military’s efforts to maintain peace and stability despite being pulled in various directions by elements determined to destabilize the country and government for their selfish reasons. "What country would survive if its citizens rise against the country’s organized, trained and equipped military?, the presidential spokesman quizzed. He said the Presidency advise d former leaders to take advantage of the various fora where people with a history of national security could offer advice to the government without resorting to the exploitation of emotional sentiments.  "The civil war motto: “TO KEEP NIGERIA ONE IS A TASK THAT MUST BE DONE” rings very timely at this time in our nation’s history.  "We must be careful to avoid the mess that destroyed other African countries like Somalia," Shehu cautioned
