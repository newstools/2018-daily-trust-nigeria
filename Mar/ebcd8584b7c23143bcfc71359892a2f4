A non-governmental organisation, Concerned Association for Transparency and National Advancement (CATNA) has commenced sensitisation of Nigerians on the fight against corruption. The group made this known through its Chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT), Tukur Idris Amiru, who is the House of Representatives vice chairman of the Committee on Anti-Corruption when the organisation held a two-day roundtable on its objectives in Abuja on Tuesday. Amiru said the modus operandi of the group was ‘One Unit, Five Hundred Advocates’ whereby a trained anti-corruption advocate from a polling unit is designated to bring together people in a small group for the purpose of sensitisation, re-orientation and education on the negative effects of corruption and the danger it posed to future generations.
