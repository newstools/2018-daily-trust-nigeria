The Director of Veterinary Services of the Agricultural Services and Rural Development Secretariat ofb the FCT Administration, Dr. Reginald A. Adunugba, has said a ministerial task force will soon go after unhygienic haulage of meat and chicken across the area councils. Adunugba stated this when she led some staff of the department on an advocacy visit to the Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Hajiya, in his office on Tuesday. She said the way and manner meat and chicken was transported was unhygienic, saying people who consumed such were prone to contacting typhoid fever. “When we came for a workshop here in this area council, we noticed that the way meat sellers transported meat was not hygienic. That why why we distributed handbills to them because hygiene is very important. “We don’t want a situation whereby a ministerial task force will soon commence work and when they (butchers) are arrested, they will say they are not aware of what is going on,” she added. The director told the council chairman that the department would be meeting with all the traditional rulers and community leaders to enlighten them on the programme. Responding, the chairman of the council thanked the department for setting up the task force to go round the six area councils to ensure there was hygienic transportation of not only meat, but to ensure all abattoirs were kept clean in the territory. He assured them of his administration’s support to ensure that the transportation of meat and chicken, as well as keeping the abattoir in the area clean, yielded  positive result for the good health of  residents.
