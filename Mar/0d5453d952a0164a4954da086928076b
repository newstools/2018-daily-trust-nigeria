The Church of God Mission International  is rehabilitating 100 of victims of human trafficking in Edo state through skill acquisition. The General Overseer of the church, Arch. Bishiop Magaret Idahosa,  disclosed this at the weekend in Benin during the 2nd edition of the Benson Idahosa five-kilometer legacy road race organized by the church to mark the 20th years anniversary of the death of Arch. Bishiop Idahosa. He said the rehabilitation project was part of efforts to address illegal migration. ‎”This year makes it 20 years since Arch Bioshop Benson Idahosa exited from this planet and we are remembering him today because of the legacies he left behind. Everything he left behind, the church, hospital, Bible school and university are still functioning well. So the exercise is to mark the 20 years of working legacies,” she said, adding, “We have a skill acquisition  centre where we train victims of human trafficking and Libya returnees on various skills such as plumbing computers,  block layer, hair dressing catering and  tailoring.” She called on the youths to always have faith in God as the only helper.
