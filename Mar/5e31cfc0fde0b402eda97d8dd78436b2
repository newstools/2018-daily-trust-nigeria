The President, Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Auditors in Nigeria (CIFIA), Dr Victoria Enape, has said the CIFIA Bill does not pose a threat to other professional bodies. Enape, who spoke in Abuja, said Nigeria has no other body in the field of forensic and investigative auditing. The public hearing on the bill was organised by the Senate Committee on Establishment and Public Service chaired by Sen. Emmanuel Paulker on March 15. The auditor had said the body would strengthen the anti-corruption fight by training relevant government agencies in the use of science and technology along with forensic and investigative skills for auditing of financial statements. “We have to be a forensic audit body that will be able to audit the financial statement with the use of science and technology. Fraudsters have gone digital and we have to tackle them digitally,” she noted.
