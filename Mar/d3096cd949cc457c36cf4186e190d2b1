A house wife is seeking the dissolution of her eight-year marriage at a Grade One Area Court, Gwagwa in the FCT. Sakina Saleh approached the court to seek divorce from her husband, Basiru Auwal, alleging that he absconded for the past one year and three months. She informed the court that her husband had not been in contact with her ever since he left their home at Unguwar Kiriya, Gwagwa, to travel to Yola, Adamawa State, and that all efforts to locate him through his phone were not successful. The woman also told the court that a family member had given her some money to start petty trading in order to take care of herself and their seven- year-old son, but that the money had finished and that she had since relocated to her family house where she was currently living with her parents. The judge, Adam H. Aliyu, ordered that somebody should be delegated to travel to the area with a mission to locate the husband, adding that the next sitting on the matter would continue after 40 days from the time when the search mission had started.
