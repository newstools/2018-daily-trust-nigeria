The mayor of Tripoli has disappeared, with city authorities saying he was kidnapped while other officials say he is in custody and being interrogated. The Libyan capital’s municipal authorities say armed gunmen took Abdelraouf Beitelmal from his home. However, public officials said he was being held and questioned for an unspecified crime. Government and militia forces have vied for power in Libya since the uprising in 2011. Sources close to Mr Beitelmal’s family said gunmen had stormed the family home after midnight. They claim the men fired at the house and beat Mr Beitelmal’s son with a Kalashnikov before taking the mayor away. In a statement, Tripoli’s municipal council blamed “a foolish party” for the abduction, and said it was suspending its work in protest.
