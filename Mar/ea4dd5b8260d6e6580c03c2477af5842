The Kaduna State chapter of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has expressed concern over  insecurity in the state and called on the state government to take urgent measures to check it. Speaking when a team from the Kaduna office of Media Trust Limited paid them a courtesy visit yesterday, the chairman, Haruna Usman Tugga, said serious intervention is needed in Southern Kaduna as the crisis in the area is becoming alarming. Tugga said over a hundred Fulani were buried during the last crisis in Kajuru. “The government must ensure that all citizens are given equal rights and opportunities so that justice is seen to be done in the interest of peace,” he said. He also commended the management of Media Trust Limited. The women leader of the association, Hadiza Bashir, frowned at how Fulani people are prevented from getting relief materials during  crisis. The Regional Manager, Kaduna office, Isa Danjuma, assured members of the association of the company’s continued support in all its activities.
