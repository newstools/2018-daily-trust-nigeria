 The Victim Support Fund (VSF) has commenced field assessment of the communities in Benue State affected by herders/farmers crisis. Executive Director of VSF, Prof. Sunday Ochoche, said on Thursday in Makurdi that the move was in response to a letter written to the organisation by Governor Samuel Ortom on the need for the Fund to intervene in the state, particularly in the area of schools and hospitals destroyed during invasions. "Our visit is in response to the letter you (Ortom) wrote to our chairman, General Theophilus Danjuma (rtd) for intervention on the destruction your state has suffered during herdsmen attacks. I'm therefore directed by the chairman to come to Benue State to carry out a rapid assessment of the devastation in affected areas of the state," he said. Ochoche also told the governor that the outcome of the exercise in the state which he would be carried out alongside his team for three days will be presented to VSF and advised on the way forward to provide support for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of facilities in the areas affected. The executive director however intimated that the move was the first time VSF would venture outside its primary responsibility to support Boko haram's victim in north eastern part of the country, having performed credibly over the years as he added that the current changing dynamics would probably require the review of the Fund's mandate. Responding, Ortom who commended the efforts of the VSF in the northeast appealed to the team to visit all devastated LGAs which includes; Agatu, Makurdi, Gwer West, Ukum, Guma, Logo, Kwande and Okpokwu amongst other affected locality. The governor also urged the team to visit at least one of the eight Internally Displaced Peoples' (IDPs) camp while combing the state to see things for themselves just as he solicited the organisation support for the over 160,000 IDPs in different camps across the state.
