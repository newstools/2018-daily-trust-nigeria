The United Progressives Party (UPP) has said President Muhammadu Buhari declined to assent to the electoral bill sent to him by the National Assembly because he is afraid of losing the 2019 presidential election. The party in a statement by its National Chairman, Chief Chekwas Okorie, yesterday, said if signed into law, the re-ordering of sequence of elections as contained in the electoral bill would ensure that candidates of various political parties won elections essentially on their personal merit and the popularity of their parties’ manifestos. “If the APC and President Buhari are confident that the record of their performances are impressive as they often claim, there should be no reason why this fear should be expressed in the manner of withholding assent to a bill that holds very strong promise to deepen and develop our democracy,” the UPP said.
