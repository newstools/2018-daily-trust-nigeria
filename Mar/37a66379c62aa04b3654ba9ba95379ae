Teaching financial literacy to children has been identified among factors necessary to prepare them for the future. The project director, yourfinances.biz <http://yourfinances.biz> and also an executive of Life Skills Experts, Omagbitse Barrow, who made this known while addressing journalists yesterday, said children need to be taught the importance of planning, budgeting, honesty and dignity of labour. “You teach children everything to prepare them for the future, so why not teach them about money. The scope of our curriculum is beyond making money and getting rich. What we teach is ethical management of financial resources,” he said. Barrow, who was speaking as part of activities to mark the Global Money Week themed, ‘Money matters even for children,’ said the group hopes to engage 180 children from 20 public and 40 private schools on financial literacy. “Financial literacy is broader than investing and making money. What we are doing is not just about their future, it is about what they are doing today and continuously doing it therefore building the right foundation and it will be part of them so by the time they become adults it will be well cemented,” he said.
