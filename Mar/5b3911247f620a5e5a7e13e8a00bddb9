 National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus has threatened legal action if information minister Lai Mohammed fails to retract a N200 million fraud allegation he made against him. On Friday, Mohammed listed Secondus among PDP chiefs he alleged looted public money during the PDP administration. Ike Abonyi, a spokesman for Secondus said the PDP boss’s lawyer Emeka Etiaba wrote the information minister accusing him of liber and defamation of character. The letter had reference number EESE&C/1/31/03/18 and argued that Mohammed’s statement was damaging, insisting SEcondus has been “humiliated, castigated and vilified by many as a result of the falsehood published by the minister." “If the minister fails to meet their demands after 48 hours, we shall within 72 hours from today, proceed to a court of competent jurisdiction to ventilate our client's right under the law and shall further seek the protection of the court against you,” the letter read.
