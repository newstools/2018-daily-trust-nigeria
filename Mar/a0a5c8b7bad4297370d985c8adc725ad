Africa’s only female head of state, Mauritian President Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, is refusing to quit over an expense scandal, just days after it was announced she would resign. Ms Gurib-Fakim denies any misconduct after allegations emerged she made tens of thousands worth of personal purchases on a charity bank card. Her office has said the purchases were accidental and have been paid back. The country’s prime minister had said she would stand down on Monday. But the president’s office has now contradicted this statement. “Her Excellency Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, having nothing to feel guilty about and able to provide corroborating evidence, rejects any idea of resigning,” the president’s office statement said.
