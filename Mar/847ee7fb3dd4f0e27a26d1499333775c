The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has announced that it is not participating in the forthcoming local government elections slated for tomorrow. A statement signed by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Chris Osa Nehikhare, said the PDP did not submit any candidate for any of the positions in any of the wards and local government areas. “We filed a case in court challenging Edo State Independent Electoral Commission (EDSIEC), Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA) and the state government to challenge their powers, among other breaches, to amend the rules for the conduct of the elections. The case has been adjourned to April 11, for hearing,” he said. He said the PDP had outlined grievances regarding the composition of EDSIEC, the alleged unconstitutional amendment to the number of days of notice required to be given to political parties before elections, among others. He said they also refused to participate in the elections “in order not to give credibility to a flawed and skewed process whereby winners have been predetermined, and elections results already written in government house and handed over to the EDSIEC for announcement.”
