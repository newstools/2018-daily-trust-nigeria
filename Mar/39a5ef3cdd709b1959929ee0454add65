A chieftain of the APC in Nasarawa State, Aliyu Bala Ahmed Tafida and about 20, 000 people have defected to the PDP in the state. Tafida announced his defection at the weekend in the presence of the Chairman, Board of Trustees (BOT) of the PDP, Senator Walid Jibrin; the  Zonal Chairman (North-Central) of PDP Hon. Dakas Shan; Senator Phillips Gyunka; and Hon. Frances Orogu among others. Tafida came second in the primaries that produced the late lawmaker representing Nasarawa/Toto Federal Constituency, Musa Baba Onwana. Welcoming the defectors, Senator Jibrin said Tafida’s entrance was a blessing to the party. “We in PDP believe power belongs to God and that He gives it to whoever He wants. He has given us before and He has taken it but we are working to position ourselves to enjoy His grave once more next year,” he said. Tafida said he was happy to be in PDP. “I am happy to be here. I am happy to be where I will be valued, appreciated and be given my due regard.”
