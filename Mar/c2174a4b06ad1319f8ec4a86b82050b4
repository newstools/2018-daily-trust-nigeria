Leaders from the Southern part of Nigeria, comprising of the South-South, South-West and the South-East as well as leaders of the Middle-belt region have called on the Federal Government to take the issue of restructuring seriously, saying it is the only way to tackle problems confronting the country. The President of Middle Belt Forum, Dr Bala Takaya, that of Afanifere, Chief Ayo Adebayo, the leader of Ohaneze Ndi-Igbo, Chief John Nwodo and the Chairman of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Chief Edwin Clark, announced their resolve to work together to ensure a successful restructuring of the country, during a press conference in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. It was part of activities of the South-South mega rally on restructuring held in Yenagoa yesterday. A communiqué read to journalists by the President of Middle-Belt Forum, Dr Bala Takaya, on behalf of other leaders, said that given the tempo and height of insecurity of lives and property in the country, the nation seems to have regressed from the original arrangement, hence the need for restructuring. He said: “We hereby invite fellow Nigerians, desirous of equity, fairness and justice in the affairs of our dear country to join us in the task of saving the sinking ship of state. Our desire and commitment is that our dear country may resume her delayed journey towards the fulfilment of its manifest destiny.” The leader of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Nnia Nwodo, said restructuring is a call for new Nigeria, which will enhance unity and justice. He pledged to support the objective of restructuring, adding that there is no going back in their struggle.
