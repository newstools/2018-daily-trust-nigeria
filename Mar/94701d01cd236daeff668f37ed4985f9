Shehu Sani, senator representing Kaduna central, says names of Nigerians owning properties abroad should be made public rather than being disclosed only to the federal government. The federal government and some foreign countries including the United Kingdom have also started the automatic exchange of tax information (AETI) on overseas assets owned by Nigerians. The government has also consistently talked about obtaining details of Nigerians with properties abroad for investigation purposes. Sani on Saturday via Twitter said in the spirit of transparency, the government should ask for an open publication of names of those stashing ill-gotten wealth abroad. “I don’t support the federal government asking the US, UK and Dubai authorities to give the federal government the list of Nigerian properties owners in those countries.  “I’m in support of the federal government asking those countries to openly publish their names.”
