The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has inaugurated a Health Financing Technical Working Group to ensure sustainable improvement in the health financing system. The group which was inaugurated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretariat, Amada Pam, yesterday will work to make the universal health coverage goals achievable. Pam said there was an urgent need to position the FCT to access the Basic Health Care Provision Fund and realign as well as expand its health service scheme. “The FCT Health Financing Technical Working Group (FCT TWG) is not intended to substitute or duplicate the functions of the health financing unit, rather it is established with the intention to play coordination, reporting and supportive roles in driving the development and implementation that will improve the funding of healthcare in the FCT,” she said. Pam who was represented by the secretariat’s director administration and finance, Surajo Ado Faskari, called on members to contribute effectively in making FCT TWG a success. The Country Director, Health Policy Plus, Nigeria, Onoriode Ezire, one of the groups driving the scheme said the TWG is a fall out from the 61st National Council for Health meeting in Abeokuta where it was approved that states should establish and strengthen  a vibrant health financing technical working group.
