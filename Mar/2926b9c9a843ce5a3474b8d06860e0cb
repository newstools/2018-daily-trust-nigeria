Hauwa Mohammed, a 25-year-old midwife sent out a WhatsApp voice message from Rann that Boko Haram had invaded their camp. The attack claimed the lives of at least 11 persons. Hauwa Mohammed in her WhatsApp voice message said: “Please go and tell my parents they don’t know the situation that their daughter is in now. For God sake, go and tell them. Call Fatima to go and meet my parents, but she shouldn’t tell them now. “We are now in the barracks and the gunmen have come back again. Oh inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajiun…” “There they are, Boko Haram have entered where I am now; please don’t tell anyone yet, I beg you in the name of God.” “Inna lillahi wa inna….”. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has confirmed that two of its midwives were missing, indicating they may have been abducted by the Boko Haram gunmen.
