 One of the Dapchi girls freed from Boko Haram captivity says five girls died “due to congestion”  in a vehicle after they were abducted. Fatsuma Abdullahi, a 15-year-old SS1 student, is number 73 on the list of abducted Dapchi girls published by the federal information ministry. In a phone conversation with a man named as Modu Geidam, for whom Fatsuma’s father does security work, she said the girls were kept in an “underground place where even aircraft” couldn’t spot them.  But she noted none of the girls were maltreated, other than the death of the five girls shortly after their abduction. She said they were well fed throughout their captivity and the girls even had to cook their own food given. On the phone, Fatsuma said they were being taken to hospital for treatment.
