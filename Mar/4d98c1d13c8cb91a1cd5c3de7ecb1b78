President Muhammadu Buhari is due in Maiduguri on Tuesday to unveil three rice pyramids cultivated by the Borno State Farmers Association in collaboration with Walwanne and Sons Limited under Dr. Abiso Kabir. A statement signed by the Senior Special Adviser on Media to the Buhari Campaign Organisation, Alhaji Garba Dangida, said the feat confirmed the commitment of the Buhari administration to his campaign promises to reduce poverty and boost agriculture. The feat, according to the release, testified to the efforts of the administration to stimulate increased earnings from agriculture and diversify the economy from sole reliance on oil accruals. Dangida added that rice production is an evidence that peace is gradually returning to the Northeast and economic and social activities are stepping up in the area.
