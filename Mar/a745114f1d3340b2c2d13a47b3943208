A Member of the House of Representatives from Osun State, Busayo Oluwole-Oke, has said reordering the sequence of elections as proposed by the National Assembly is not out of place. Oluwloe-Oke said this in a chat with Daily Trust on the sidelines of the state congress of the PDP in Oshogbo on Sunday where the new State Working Committee (SWC) of the party was elected after the successful conclusion of ward, local and state congresses. He maintained that the request for INEC to change the elections schedule was purely a legislative matter. He said, “We will do justice to this matter because constitutionally, both the National Assembly and INEC have their functions.” Speaking on the state congress, the legislator noted that the emergence of the Olasoji Adagunodo-led SWC in Osun PDP had brought the internal crisis in the party to an end.
