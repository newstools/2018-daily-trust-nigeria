The House of Representatives has urged the Executive Arm to make adequate budgetary provision to the National Agency for the Great Green Wall to enable it achieve its objectives. The House also urged the federal ministries of environment and water resources to fast track the implementation of policies, projects and programmes in line with the Great Green Wall initiative. Adopting a motion by Beni Lar (PDP, Plateau), the House mandated the Committee on Environment and Habitat to look into the non-implementation of the Great Green Wall initiative in Nigeria and report back within eight weeks.
