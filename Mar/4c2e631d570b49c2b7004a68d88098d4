The Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) yesterday threatened to embark on industrial action if the Federal Government fails to meet  the agreement reached with it at  the expiration of  a  30-day ultimatum. The National Vice Chairman of JOHESU, Dr Ogbonna Obinna Chimela, said: “If by April 17 our  requests are not met, top of which is adjusted CONHESS, we shall have no other recourse than to down tools.” He said they had entered into an agreement with  government  on 30th of September, 2017 that led to the suspension of the  previous strike action. He added that five months after, the government was yet to come up with the approval for CONHESS adjustment. “We don’t want the masses to suffer, that was why we gave government the 30-day ultimatum,” he stated.
