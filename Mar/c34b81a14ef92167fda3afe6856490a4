The natives of the FCT under the aegis of Abuja Indigenous Association (CAIA), have said they will not vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2019 polls if their stakeholders fail to channel their pressing problems to President Muhammadu Buhari. Addressing newsmen in Abuja on Friday, the spokesman of the group, Ahmadu Yunusa Yusuf, said the natives had already lost confidence in the APC-led administration for failure to address their challenges, especially failure to give them a ministerial slot. He said the natives had expected that by now the FCT party stakeholders would team up and make a protest visit to the president, seeking a ministerial slot for the people of the territory. He said the natives would soon embark on another protest against the APC government if the stakeholders fail to take action within the shortest period of time. The natives further expressed disappointment over what they described as lukewarm attitude of the area council chairmen towards their plight. “We can’t imagine that none of these council chairmen has ever gone to the media asking Mr. President to appoint an FCT indigene as minister. And we want to make it categorically clear that we will not vote APC come 2019 election,” he added.
