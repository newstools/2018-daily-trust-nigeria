The internal wrangling within the Kogi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has taken another dimension with the expulsion of the embattled state chairman, Alhaji Hadi Ametuo and other members of his executives. The acting state chairman of the party, Alhaji Ahovi Salam Ibrahim, who is leading a faction loyal to Governor Yahaya Bello, announced the expulsion of Ametuo and others during a news conference yesterday in Lokoja. The North-Central Zonal Executive of the party had earlier announced the sack of the Ametuo-led state executives over alleged anti-party activities, a decision which the national leadership of the party has since disowned. But Alhaji Ahovi maintained that the expulsion of Alhaji Hadi Ametuo-led excos by the North-Central Zonal executive committee of the party still stands. According to him, Hadi Ametuo had a 7-day grace period to appeal his expulsion by the zonal executive of the party as stipulated by the APC’s constitution and that his failure to go for an appeal was an indication that he agreed with the decision. He noted that the Hadi Ametuo-led executives were free to pitch their tents with other political parties “which they have been hobnobbing with”. Alhaji Ahovi maintained that he and his executives were behind President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Yahaya Bello, adding that they would work assiduously for their victory in 2019 and 2020. He said that the recent elongation of the tenure of national and state working committees of the party by the National Executive Committee only favours those committed to the good cause of the party “and not the likes of the Hadi Ametuo-led excos”.
