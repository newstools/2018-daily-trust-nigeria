The Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, has called on northern governors to consider use of local languages in schools, to facilitate breakthrough in science and technology. The emir said this while delivering a pre-convocation lecture at the Gombe State University. He said teaching in the local languages will improve the quality of education in the region. The emir added that ignorance and poverty in the northern region must be tackled headlong to make any headway. He challenged northerners, especially those from North-East and North-West to discard a system that keeps them permanently backward in all aspects of human endeavour. Emir Sanusi therefore challenged leaders, especially the governors to initiate and force changes that will better the lives of the common man. Speaking on the topic, “the social reform project in Kano and the imperative of change in Northern Nigeria,” Sanusi said for the north to develop, its people must change their perception and poor attitude towards education. He added that the region was backward with the highest figure in maternal, infant and mortality rate, under-five deaths, lack of access to modern education and employment among others. The emir lamented however that “it is the system that has kept the region from attaining its full potential despite having large land mass, highest population and abundant natural resources, especially in agriculture.” He said: “We cannot have economic growth until we move into the grassroots and deal with the issues. Take the Northern Nigeria, 70 per cent of Nigeria’s landmass, highest number of people, grossly endowed with abundant natural resources, most diverse in many aspects but the poorest part in the country.” He also spoke on the negative application of the Almajiri system where he stated that the child begging on the street was not to blame, but his parents and the system.
