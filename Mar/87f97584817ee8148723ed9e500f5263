A Kano State High court has ordered a former Commissioner of Land in the state, Alhaji Farouk Bibi Farouk and two others currently standing trial before it to enter defence on the 20th April, 2018.

The decision of the court followed the striking out of an application of no case submission filed before it by counsels to the three accused persons, Barrister Akerelu Kehinde for the 1st accused person and Barrister A. A. Mu’Allim for the 2nd and 3rd accused persons.

When the case came up today for ruling on the no case submission application, the presiding Judge, Justice Nasiru Saminu, stroke out the application on the ground that it lacks merit.

He averred that, “Although the written address submitted to this honourable court by the three accused persons was very rich, but there are certain areas, the trio need to shed more lights to clear their names.

“The decision of this court to compel the three accused persons to enter defence will serve as a golden opportunity to them to give detail explanations on certain issues related to the matter.

“Going by the testimonies of the six witnesses presented by the applicant and the exhibits tendered before this honourable court, there is need for the three accused persons to enter defence to
absolve themselves from the charges levelled against them.”

Justice Saminu therefore adjourned the case to April 20, 2018 for the three accused persons to enter defence.

The former commissioner Farouk Bibi Farouk, former permanent secretary of the ministry, Alhaji Mahmud Bello Bari and the former director, Alhaji Ahmad Ibrahim were arraigned before the court since last year.

The trio were accused of criminal conspiracy and breach of trust that led to illegal sale of plots and issuance of fake Certificates of Occupancy, the offences contrary to Sections 95 and 315 of the Penal
Code Law.
