A former Governor of Jigawa State and PDP presidential aspirant, Alhaji Sule Lamido, yesterday in Calabar, alleged that Nigeria has been hijacked and is being ruled by men who lack ideas. Lamido said the ruling APC was only implementing what the former ruling party, the PDP, drew. He stated this when he paid a consultative visit to Governor Ben Ayade on his presidential aspiration. Lamido alleged that whereas PDP was accused of spending about N6tn on some national projects in 16 years, the APC had wasted more than N20tn in three years and had nothing to show for it. He, therefore, wondered why only people in the opposition were being vilified and labelled as corrupt. On security, Lamido said killing and destruction were no longer strange, but that the question now was, “How many have been killed today?” Ayade on his part, described Lamido as “humane, people-friendly and man of depth and concern who turned Jigawa State into an Eldorado.”
