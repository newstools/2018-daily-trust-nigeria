President Muhammadu Buhari and principal officers of the National Assembly did not meet last night as scheduled. They had been earlier scheduled to meet at 8:00pm at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja. Sources at the Presidency said the meeting was expected to discuss the delay in the passage of the 2018 Appropriation Bill. Speaking to Daily Trust, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters, Senator Ita Enang, said the meeting was rescheduled. He added that the meeting could not hold because President Buhari travelled to Accra for the 61st independence anniversary of Ghana. Enang also stated that the President of the Senate, Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki, was also not around. He told our correspondent on telephone that Buhari and the leaders of the legislature agreed that the meeting be rescheduled for their “better convenience”. The presidential aide, however, did not specify when the meeting would hold.
