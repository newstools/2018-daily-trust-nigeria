The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria chapter has pulled out of the ongoing national strike of the union. The chairman of ABU-SSANU, Comrade Iliya Abdulrauf Bello, made this known during a congress meeting, saying that the strike has not made any significant impact in ABU. He added; “I am directing all our members to resume to work immediately. Despite the 3-month-old strike in the university, work has continued unhindered. This has ridiculed the strike in its totality.” However, a former chairman of ABU-SSANU, Malam Alfa Gimba, said Bello is no more a SSANU member, therefore does not have the powers to call-off the strike. Gimba said; “when he was suspended as the chairman of ABU-SSANU, he went to court and the court ruled against him. The national body therefore expelled him. How can that person make any pronouncement on behalf of the union? Our authentic chairman in ABU is Halilu Sha’aibu Ahmed.” Daily Trust reports that before yesterday’s development, students were having their routine lectures. The impact of the SSANU strike was mostly felt by students that need to conduct practical in science laboratories or engineering workshops, as the facilities were either locked or the instructors, being members of the union, were not there to attend to them. Again, water supply in the university was sometimes disrupted; where the water was available, it was often not clean. Students interviewed by our correspondent welcomed the suspension of the strike, saying that the development would make positive impact on their studies and welfare.
