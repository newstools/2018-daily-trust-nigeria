The Chairman of Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) Gwagwalada branch, Comrade Ismail Idris Kehinde, has given succour to almajiris in Zuba, Abuja. Kehinde, who distributed toiletries, biscuits and other consumables to over 300 almajiris, yesterday, said the gesture was simply to show compassion to a group of young boys whom society sometimes neglect. “I personally feel for almajiris in their lives of constant deprivation and perpetual need. I have been touched by the unconcerned attitude of the populace and especially, of the Muslim community towards them,” he said. He enjoined the Muslims to act compassionately towards the almajiris rather than just sympathise with their condition.
