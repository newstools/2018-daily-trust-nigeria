Leaders and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the three senatorial districts in Oyo State, at the weekend, threatened to leave for another party if impunity continued. They also vowed to resist any form of imposition and impunity from the national secretariat of the party. It would be recalled that a former Governor of the state, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, threatened to leave the party if the imposition and impunity from the national secretariat to tamper with the list of party executives in the state persisted. Crisis erupted in Oyo PDP after the harmonisation of the state executives through a proposed sharing formula of the 26 state positions in the party in ratio of 14 and 12 between the two groups loyal to Ladoja and the governorship hopeful, Engr. Seyi Makinde, despite the approval of the congress that ushered in the National Executive Committee (NEC) that validated the executives. Rising from their senatorial districts meeting held at various locations, members and leaders of the PDP in Oyo South, Oyo North and Oyo Central declared that any attempt by the national leadership of the party to tamper with the present structure of the party leadership in the state might leave them with no option than to quit the party en masse. This threat was contained in a statement made available to journalists by the partyâ€™s state Public Relations Officer, Engineer Akeem Olatunji. They also passed a vote of confidence on the leadership of the party executives from the wards to the state levels under the chairmanship of Alhaji Omokunmi Mustapha and affirmed Ladoja as the leader of the party in the state.
