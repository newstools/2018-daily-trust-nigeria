A former Chairman of the Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State, Godwin Akpama, has begun open campaign for the re-election of Governor Ben Ayade. Akpama, who once openly quarreled with the governor on some benefits, had exchanged bitter text messages which journalists had sighted. He said he had to sideline the APC and mobilise support for Ayade because his party which had since been embroiled in crisis that refused to go. Akpama said as it seemed, the APC leaders in the state were not serious to produce a governor in 2019. The one time governorship candidate of the Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA) said, “I have resolved to pitch my tent with Ayade despite the fact that Ayade is of the PDP. My decision to throw my weight behind Governor Ayade is because of the unseriousness, greed and self-aggrandisement exhibited by stakeholders of the APC in the state. “Why would normal party men choose to polarise the party instead of working in one accord, unity and oneness, when they know that unity itself is strength? This is absolute madness!” he said, and added that there was no democracy in the party. He said he decided to back Ayade because most APC stalwarts in the state hobnobbed with the governor and benefitted from juicy contracts.
