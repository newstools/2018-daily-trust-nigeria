An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti has sentenced a man, Lucky Ayosin, to life imprisonment for impregnating his daughter after serial rape.

Justice John Adeyeye also sentenced him to 10 yearsâ€™ imprisonment after finding him guilty of attempted murder of his son, Ilesanmi, who caught him having sex with the victim.

Adeyeye ordered that both sentences should run concurrently.

Ilesanmi was shot by the father with a single-barrelled gun in a bid to cover up the incest.

The boy escaped and reported the incident to their mother, Yemisi Bayode, who had divorced Lucky 14 years ago and left the two children in his custody.

While the case was going on, the victim, who was a Senior Secondary School 3 pupil at the time of the incident, gave birth to a baby girl from the resulting pregnancy.

The incident, according to the charge sheet, occurred on or around November 19, 2015, at Isaba-Ekiti, in the Ikole Local Government Area of the state.
