A 60-year-old cleric, Michael Adejuyigbe, has appealed to the Akure Customary Court to dissolve his 32-year-old marriage to his wife because he can no longer make love to her. Besides, Adejuyigbe alleged that the wife, Morenike, was adulterous and had abandoned their matrimonial home for eight years. He added that she once attempted to lure him into joining the cult where he said she was a member, but he refused. The marriage has produced five children, with the eldest 32 years old, the second, 30; the third, 28; the fourth, 25; and the youngest, 21 years old. Morenike denied the allegations, saying her husband wanted to divorce her mainly because he just married another wife from the same church they both worship. She dismissed the adultery allegation with an explanation that women in their family do not engage in such a vice “because there are always dire consequences for such acts.” She also told the court that her husband did not want to see her in church again, especially in the presence of his new wife there.  She begged the court to prevail on her husband to change his mind because she did not want her matrimony to crumble. Adejuyigbe said he married another wife when he realised his manhood couldn’t function with Morenike, and in the effort to try it out with another woman, the new woman became pregnant, so he decided to marryher. The president of the court, R.F. Olusanya, urged families of the couple to intervene and resolve the matter. He adjourned the case to March 29, 2018.
