Russia has expelled 60 US diplomats and closed the country’s St Petersburg consulate in a tit-for-tat response to US action over a spy poisoning case in the UK. The moves were announced by the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. It comes amid a row over the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in southern England. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury on 4 March. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys, in solidarity with the UK, which has blamed Moscow for the attack. Russia has vehemently denied any role. Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition. His daughter’s condition is said to be improving. Mr Lavrov said that the US ambassador had been informed of “retaliatory measures”. He said they included “the expulsion of the equivalent number of diplomats and our decision to withdraw permission for the functioning of the US consulate general in Saint Petersburg”.
