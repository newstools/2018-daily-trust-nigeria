Despite the belated grovelling apology, PDP will need to come clean, confess to their sins and fully atone for it, before restitution is considered, the National Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Malam Bolaji Abdullahi, has advised. Abdullahi gave the advice yesterday after the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, apologised on Monday for the party’s past mistakes at a public discourse in Abuja on contemporary politics and governance in Nigeria.
The APC spokesman, in a release signed and issued yesterday, said that Nigerians could still not forget the PDP sins in a hurry despite the apology. “The APC acknowledges the apologies by the PDP for the damage the party has brought on the country's democratic fabric during its sixteen year rule. “As they say, to err is human but forgiveness is divine. We join PDP in praying to God to forgive them, but Nigerians are human who are still suffering from the years of PDP's misrule. Therefore, even if Nigerians are gracious enough to forgive, they will not forget in a hurry,” the release added.
