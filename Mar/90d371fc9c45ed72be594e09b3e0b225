The National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has kicked against the planned conduct of local government elections in Imo State. The governor had scheduled June this year to conduct local government elections in the state. However, the union reminded Governor Rochas Okorocha that it still had a pending appeal at the Supreme Court over the 2011 dissolution of elected local government administrators in the state. NULGE made their position known in a statement signed by Chief Emmanuel Odor and Aguronye Bede for Owerri Zone, Messrs Ezekiel Basil and E. E Amaefule, Okigwe Zone and Ezekiel Chukwukere for Orlu Zone. The local government employees said despite the fact that their challenge of the dissolution of elected local government administrators in 2011 was affirmed by the appellate court, the governor was yet to obey the decision of the court. “Our attention has been drawn to another prank by Imo State’s worst problem today, Governor Okorocha, purporting to conduct local government elections in June, 2018, in clear breach of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which he swore to defend,” the statement read in part.
