Aminu Musa Abdusalam Foundation (AMA) has carried out free surgery for 65 patients in Mararaba Gurku medical centre of Nasarawa State as part of its eye care humanitarian service. Speaking to journalists after the surgeries, the medical director of the foundation, Aisha Yusuf Mamman, said eye care was part of the foundation’s focus as statistics had shown that 80 per cent of eye blindness was avoidable. “Blindness begins with cataract and what we do here is that we screen and operate cataract and also offer medicated glasses and medication to patients. “So far we have done 65 in Nasarawa and over 1,500 in the 15 states we have visited across all the geo-political zones.” The director added that most cases of eye problem arose from trauma and inadequate care for the eye, and urged Nigerians to go for routine checks especially if they noticed irregularities with their eyes. One of the beneficiaries, Sunday Chagga, a resident of Panda community in Nasarawa State said he had eye sight problem for over 20 years and couldn’t afford medical treatment until the foundation carried out surgery on him.
