Senate President Bukola Saraki said the Senate has rejected ‘only’ 13 out of 240 confirmation requests of President Muhammadu Buhari. Saraki spoke during plenary session yesterday, when the appointment of Ibrahim Rufai Imam was confirmed as the Grand Khadi, Sharia Court of Appeal, Abuja. He said since the 8th Senate was inaugurated in June 2015 to date, the President has made 240 confirmation requests. “Let me on behalf of the entire Senate congratulate the new Grand Khadi, Sharia Court of Appeal, Ibrahim Rufai Imam and wish him a successful tenure. I hope that he continues to play his role in the judiciary. “So far, we have treated about 240 confirmations here in the Senate, of which 227 have been affirmative and only 13 have been negative. “Sometimes, we get the impression that this Senate tends to say more ‘No’ than ‘Yes.’ But these numbers today show the level of cooperation that we will continue to give the executive,” he said. The confirmation of Imam followed the consideration and adoption of the report of the Senate Committee on Judiciary.
