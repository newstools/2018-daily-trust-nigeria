A housewife seeking to end her 19-year-old marriage has told an Upper Area Court that she was no longer in love with her husband. Mrs Juliana Ezekiel, who resides at Auta Bailefi in Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, said she was not at peace with her husband allegedly due to frequent beating she suffers from him despite having four children for him. “He would accuse me of having extra marital affairs, calling me a prostitute and cultist. He beats me at any slightest provocation,” she told the court. She also affirmed that the respondent did not discuss matters with her as husband and wife would and that it was in 2016 that she got to know that her husband had lost his job without him telling her. “After losing his job, my husband now gets involved in criminal acts. On several occasions, policemen would come to search our house and have him arrested,” she said. She said the intervention of her parents did not help in instilling peace in their home. “There was this occasion when I bought a television set, he attacked and beat me, saying that it was my boyfriend that bought it for me. All effort to prove to him that it was from an auction fell on deaf ears,” she said. Her husband, Mr Ezekiel Doyari, a former clerk of the Federal Service Commission, told the court that he still loved his wife very much. The judge, Yakubu Ishaku, urged the couple to maintain peace and adjourned the case to April, 3, 2018.
