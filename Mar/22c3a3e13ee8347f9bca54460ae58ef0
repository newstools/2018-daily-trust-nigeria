A Kenyan High Court judge has convicted three state officials of contempt of court for refusing to obey court orders in relation to the detention of opposition politician Miguna Miguna. Judge Odunga had ordered the interior minister, the head of police and a top official at the immigration department to appear in court for their failure to release Mr Miguna. “There is no immunity to impunity. No man is above the law and no man is below it,” Citizen TV reports Mr Odunga as having said.
