   Facebook has been given two weeks by the European Union to respond to the allegations of large-scale data mining according to a letter obtained by AFP on Tuesday. Cambridge Analytica revealed to an undercover reporter that information from about 50 million Facebook users was taken without their consent and used for U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign. The EU’s justice commissioner Vera Jourova wrote on Facebook,  “have any data of EU citizens been affected by the recent scandal, I would appreciate a reply in the next two weeks.” Details soon.
