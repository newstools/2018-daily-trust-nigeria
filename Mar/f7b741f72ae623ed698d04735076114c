A Russian transport plane crashed in Syria killing all 39 people on board with the defence ministry saying the aircraft reportedly wasn’t shot down. The Antonov-26 aircraft crashed at Russia’s Khmeimim airbase in Latakia province on Tuesday, Russian media quoted the ministry as saying. Initial information suggested the crash may have been caused by a technical fault. The aircraft hit the ground about 500 metres short of the runway, the ministry said. Thirty-three passengers and six crew members were on the aircraft when it went down at about 3pm Moscow time (12:00GMT). All of the people aboard were Russian military personnel.
