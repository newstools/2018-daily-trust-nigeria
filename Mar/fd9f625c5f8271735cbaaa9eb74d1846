As Christians across the globe celebrate Easter, the Kaduna state command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has deployed over 3,000 personnel to different parts of the state while it advised parents and guardians to encourage their children and wards to shun crime and eschew violence.  The State Commandant of the Corps, Alhaji Modu Bunu in his Easter message, urged members of the public to be vigilant; saying arrangements have been concluded to provide optimum security across the state before, during and after the festive period.  He appealed to members of the public to collaborate with security agencies by reporting persons and acts that would disrupt the relative peace and co-existence enjoyed in the state. “Security agencies are determined towards discharging their statutory duties, but the public must complement them by reporting acts and people with tendencies to mar their work.”  “On our part, we are collaborating to block the loopholes for any act of insecurity to thrive. We are ready to provide tight security before, during and after the celebrations, and will continue to pave the way for development,” he stressed.  While felicitating with the Christian community in the state, the NSCDC state helmsman urged Christians to emulate Christ in they do.
