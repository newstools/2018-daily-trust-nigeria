A staff of the office of the Accountant General of the Federation has been jailed for leaking government documents. A Magistrate Court 18, sitting in Abuja, sentenced Aminu Maru, an accountant seconded to the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), to one year in prison for illegal disclosure of official documents. Maru was however granted an option of paying a fine of N100,000 by the court. The accountant was arraigned by the Department of State Security (DSS) for leaking official government documents to non-civil servants for money. The conviction followed Maruâ€™s guilty plea on Tuesday.
