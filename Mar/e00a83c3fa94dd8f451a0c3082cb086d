The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has blamed environmental factors for the incessant clashes between farmers and herders. The Minister stated this at a town hall meeting organized for staff of the Nigerian Embassy in Berlin, Germany, and a cross-section of Nigerians residing in the European country over the weekend. Alhaji Mohammed while noting that the narrative being pushed in certain quarters gave ethnic and religious coloration to the clashes, but stressed that the clashes were caused by environmental factors. He assured the gathering of the Federal Government’s commitment to finding a lasting solution to the clashes. The minister said Nigeria’s population in 1963 was about 48 million, it is now about 180 million, with the country’s land mass remaining the same, meaning there are more people per square kilometre and raising the chances of clashes over dwindling resources. He also said the Lake Chad that used to provide water and other resources to more than 30 million people in four countries, including Nigeria, in the early 1960s has shrunk by about 90%, from 25,000 square kilometres to 2,500 square kilometres, thus forcing those affected to move southwards in search of resources. “Other reasons, like desertification, have altered the resource landscape, heightened competition for dwindling resources and raised the possibility of clashes between farmers and herders,” he said adding that the establishment of ranches was one sure way of reducing such clashes. The minister said in resolving the crisis, both farmers and herders must be willing to shift slightly from their positions, which are grounded in their ways of life over centuries.
