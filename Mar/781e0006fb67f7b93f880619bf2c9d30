The leadership of Arewa Youth Assembly (AYA) has accused Senator Dino Melaye (APC, Kogi West) of impersonating the group and using it for illegal activities. The group said it had summoned an emergency meeting of its executive members to consider legal action against the senator. Leaders of the group said their attention was drawn to a photo banner posted on the Facebook wall of Senator Dino Melaye against constituted authority in Kogi State using the name of AYA. A statement signed by Speaker of AYA, Muhammed Salihu, said, “The photo banner which read ‘Malami Shame on You’ and ‘GYB Big Shame on You’ was allegedly sponsored by the Arewa Youth Assembly, which has been debunked by the assembly. “Sen. Dino Melaye has continued to make mockery of our highly respected upper chamber of the National Assembly,” the group said.
