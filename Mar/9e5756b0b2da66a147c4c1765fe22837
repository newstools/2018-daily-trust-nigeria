The chairman of Abaji Area Council,  Alhaji Abdulrahman  Ajiya,  has urged youth corps members in the area to be innovative  and creative so as not wait for hard to get white collar jobs at the end of their  service. Ajiya, represented by the secretary of the council, Alhaji Kamal Adamu Shuaibu, during the corps members-employers parley in the area last Thursday, stressed the need for them to learn skills that will help them become self-reliant. He said the rate of unemployment in the country was alarming hence the need for them to be creative and find ways to be self-employed. He said the council under his administration had given  priority  to the welfare  of corps members  since it assumed office through  payment of their  monthly allowance. Also speaking, the Abaji zonal inspector of NYSC, Prince Joseph  Andy, commended the council chairman for the prompt payment  of corps members’  monthly allowance. “We can also recall how the present administration intensified effort to provide female corps members’ lodge which has enhanced conducive accommodation  for  our corps members,” he added. The zonal inspector charged other  area councils  to emulate the chairman of Abaji, by  giving priority to corps members’ welfare.
