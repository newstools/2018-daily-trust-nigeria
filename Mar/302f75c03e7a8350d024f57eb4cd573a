The Federation of International Basketball Association (FIBA) has ordered for a new election to the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) board.

In a letter signed by FIBA Secretary General, Patrick Baumann, FIBA expressed dissatisfaction that neither of the elections held in the name of the Nigeria Basketball Federation were carried out in accordance with the FIBA general statutes. 

FIBA insisted that the NBBF election must be held in accordance with a procedure established in the NBBF statutes. 

The World Basketball governing body promised to work with relevant stakeholders to amend and develop the NBBF statutes. 

FIBA will decide when the elections are held and had resolved to continue communication with the Kids Musa led board until the elections are held. 

Three man FIBA executive committee members were in Abuja late January to interface with both Tijani Umar and Musa Kida, the two individuals battling to control the affairs of basketball in Nigeria.
