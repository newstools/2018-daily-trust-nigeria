The PDP has said its apology to Nigerians is a pathway to national healing, renewal of hope and re-mobilisation of the citizenry for the task of rescuing the nation from its current challenges. The party, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan, said it was deeply saddened that Nigerians were suffering, adding that the apology was to give the masses hope ahead of the 2019 general elections. “It is imperative to further state that our apology has to do more with the fact that we made certain mistakes that allowed an anti-people movement to take over governance in our country. “Our situation under the APC has become so pathetic that the world is now contemplating on how to help us. Under the APC misrule, the average life span of Nigerians has become abysmally low, purchasing power is eroded, the middle class has been wiped off, security is almost non-existent, all the economic gains of the PDP years have been destroyed, and our nation is now placed on auto-pilot. ‎”Therefore, our apology is to ask Nigerians, once again, to put their trust in the re-branded PDP, particularly, as our party is the only platform that is committed to the national agenda of peace, unity, justice and prosperous nation,” the PDP said.
