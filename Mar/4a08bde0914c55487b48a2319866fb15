The Governing Board of the Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority (OGFZA) has said one of its priority projects for 2018 is to accelerate the take-off of the Brass Oil and Gas City. The Chairman of the OGFZA board, Chief Timipre Sylva, said this during the inaugural meeting of the board of the agency at the Oil and Gas Free Zone, Onne, Rivers State. Brass Oil and Gas City, located in Brass Island; Brass, in Bayelsa State, was designed to evolve into one of the largest petrochemical, fertilizer, refinery and hydrocarbon processing hubs in the world. Present at the inaugural board meeting were Mr. Umana Okon Umana, OGFZA Managing Director, and members, Engr. Kuyebi Temitope and Mr. Frank Owhor. Others were Mrs. Ngozi Jipreze, Murtala Adhama, Dr. Emi Membere-Otaji, Mrs. Ifuoma Isaac and Barr. Abdulwasiu Sule, who is secretary of the board. Chief Sylva said the BOG City “was approved and licensed as a free zone a long time ago” adding that “We have to make sure that the Brass Oil and Gas City becomes operational as soon as possible.” He said another target the board would like to achieve before the end of the year was the building of a turbine for the free zone as the management had already engaged a group of investors for it. The OGFZA chairman said efforts to improve the revenue position of the agency through effective IGR strategy would receive equal priority attention. He added that his board would also do all that was necessary to resolve issues of conflict between the Nigeria Export Processing Authority (NEPZA) and OGFZA.
