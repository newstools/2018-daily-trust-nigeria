President Muhammadu Buhari has extends heartfelt condolences to the Abebe family as well as the government and people of Edo State on the death of Dr Christopher Abebe, aged 99. The late Abebe was the father of former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s late wife, Stella. Buhari, in a statement Friday by his spokesman Mr Femi Adesina, also commiserated with the in-laws, friends, the organised private sector and the Iruekpen community in Edo State over the passage of the astute and dedicated community leader and business mogul. He expressed belief that as the Odionwere (community leader) of Iruekpen, the first indigenous chairman and managing director of United Africa Company, pro-chancellor and chairman of councils of three Universities (Benin, Nsukka and Calabar), Abebe was a shining light and worthy example of hardwork, positive influence and patriotism to his local community, the private sector and the nation.  He urged family members, business associates and the Catholic Church in Nigeria where the deceased served committedly as Papal Knight of St Gregory and Supreme Knight of St. Mulumba to honour his memory by upholding his lifelong dedication and passion to human development. The president prayed that Almighty God grant the soul of the departed eternal rest and comfort all who mourn him.
