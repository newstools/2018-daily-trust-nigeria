The UK and EU have agreed on a “large part” of the agreement that will lead to the “orderly withdrawal” of the UK. Brexit negotiators Michel Barnier and David Davis said the deal on what the UK calls the implementation period was a “decisive step”. But issues still to be resolved include the Northern Ireland border. The transitional period is set to last from 29 March, 2019 to December 2020, and is intended to smooth the path to a future permanent relationship. Mr Barnier said there was also an agreement on the rights of 4.5m EU citizens in the UK and the 1.2m UK citizens in the EU after Brexit, including giving EU citizens arriving in the UK during the transition the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit.
