Obasanjo has said his parents early death and inability to witness the turnaround in his life was "sad and regrettable" despite sacrifices made by them to ensure his success. "One thing I always miss and remember is that my parents left this world too early. The sacrifice they made, they do not wait to see the results. How I wish they have waited to see and eat fruits of their labour," Obasanjo lamented. The former President, however, remarked that his consolation was in the popular Yoruba believe that, "the dead always look behind" and that the parents would be happy for the success story so far for him. "But going by what Yoruba believe and says that, the dead always watch over their beloved ones and see happenings around them, I am convinced that, my parents are happy in their graves, as they watch over me," he emphasised. On his birthday, Obasanjo pointed out that he would continue to appreciate, praise adore and worship God, just as he commended all those who worked and still working with him, describing them as loyal aides. Obasanjo also called on the need by all to serve humanity, noting, " it is when humanity is serve that, one can serve God. I did not believe that God has created bad situation for Nigeria, or any particularly country in Africa. "We must be able to serve humanity, if we can’t serve humanity, we can’t serve God. I do not believe God had created bad situation for Nigeria, or any particular country in Africa."
