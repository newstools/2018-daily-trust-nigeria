The FCT chapter of the Medical Women Association of Nigeria (MWAN) in collaboration with the Bwari general hospital on Tuesday embarked on free eye screening for residents in the area. President of MWAN, Dr. Eno Ekop, said the association was embarking on the free eye screening for people having glaucoma and other eye sight problems in the area. She said there were some people who had been suffering from cataract and glaucoma. Ekpo, who is also a pediatric consultant, said glaucoma affects people between the ages of 40 years and above, even as she said a newly born child sometimes gets glaucoma through infections. A 13 year- old girl, Rahila Yunana John, who spoke with our reporter after she carried out eye test, said she had been suffering from eye sight problem for over a year ago. She said she could hardly see an object from afar but expressed delight that she got help. The chief medical director of the hospital, Dr. Osagie Osayande, commended MWAN for carrying out the free eye screening at the hospital, while calling on other NGOs to emulate the association in offering assistance to patients suffering from various kinds of ailments.
