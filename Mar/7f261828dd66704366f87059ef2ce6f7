The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the Peace Corps of Nigeria (PCN) bill into law. President Buhari had recently refused to sign the bill that would have legitimized the operations of the PCN, citing duplication of functions between it and existing agencies and lack of fund for its take-off. However, NYCN in collaboration with Coalition of Non-Governmental Organisations, Civil Society Organisations and various Youth groups appealed to the president to find a way round the constraints, as rejecting the bill had dashed the hopes of millions of youths who had enrolled in the corps. Speaking to journalists on the development in Minna on behalf of the groups, the state Chairman of NYCN, Comrade Jibrin Abdullahi Muregi said the youths were anxiously waiting for the opportunity to contribute to national building through the provision of peace related services, and urged Buhari to assent to the PCN bill. Similarly, a former president of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Comrade Jude Imagwe, in a statement made available to newsmen, described the Peace Corps as a pro-youth outfit capable of curbing crime in the country and employing thousands of unemployed youths. Imagwe, who was also a former Special Adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan on Youth and Students Affair, said part of the All Progressive Congress (APC) campaign prior to the 2015 elections was to create jobs but the presidentâ€™s rejection of the Peace Corps bill was a negation of that promise
