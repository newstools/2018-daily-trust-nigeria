The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has described the former governor of the state and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as the founder of modern Lagos, which he said has made the state a role model for others to emulate. Obasa disclosed this yesterday in a message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak, in his goodwill message to Tinubu to mark his 66th birthday in Lagos. According to the Speaker, without Asiwaju’s pioneering efforts at raising the standard of governance for the state, Lagos would not have risen to its present lofty height. “Asiwaju combines his vision, ideas and leadership qualities to lay a solid foundation for subsequent administrations after him to build on, and the result is what we have today - a modern Lagos that is moving rapidly from a mega city to a smart city; the fourth biggest economy in Africa moving towards being the third biggest economy on the continent. “His vision gave us Babatunde Raji Fashola, who performed well as governor of Lagos State, and has now given us the indefatigable Akinwunmi Ambode, whose performance as governor of Lagos State for just a little over three years has made him the number one state governor in Nigeria,” Obasa said. He added that it was Asiwaju’s leadership quality and ingenuity that raised the bar for those who came after him to build solid structures. “Today, Asiwaju has written his name in gold and there is no doubt about the fact that Lagos history cannot be complete without him as the architect and founder of modern Lagos,” he said.
