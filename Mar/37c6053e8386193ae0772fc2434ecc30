He made the disclosure yesterday while inspecting the project was awarded eight years ago at the cost of N7.5 billion. He said the work suffered series of delay due to poor funding but added that it would soon be completed following the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari on completion of all on-going projects. Engineer Busari noted that the first phase of the rehabilitation work from Hadejia to Kirikasamma had since been completed and that only two kilometres remained out of the second phase of 34 kilometre covering Kirikasamma to Nguru in Yobe. “Hitherto the rehabilitation work, the road was highly dilapidated as motorists spend between two and three hours from Nguru to Hadejia which is only a distance of 70 kilometres.”
