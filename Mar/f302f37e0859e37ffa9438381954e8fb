Iberedem told the court that the accused, who lives next house to the  woman, who is two months pregnant, had been going to her house to pray  since there is a mosque in the compound. “He had earlier made sexual advances to the woman, touched her  buttock in the kitchen sometime ago which she shared with other  neighbours. “On the day the accused committed the assault, he noticed the woman’s  husband was not at home and entered her apartment, grabbed her, covered  her mouth with cloth and raped her. “It was her noise that attracted one of the neighbours and  the accused was immediately arrested and handed over to the police. “The woman lost her two months old pregnancy due to the rape,” he said. The offence contravened Section 260 of the Lagos State Criminal Code Laws, 2015. Rape attracts life imprisonment in Lagos State. The case was adjourned until April 5. (NAN)
