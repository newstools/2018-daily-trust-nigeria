The federal government and entrepreneurs in the country have been enjoined to improve economic activities between Nigeria and Japan. President of JICA Alumni Association of Nigeria (JAAN) Ahmed Agberankhe made the call at a business dinner organized by the association in Abuja on Friday. JAAN is an alumni of Nigerians who have been trained by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). He said there were enormous economic opportunities in the two countries that were not being harnessed. “Nigeria is the biggest market in Africa and Japan is among the seven most developed countries in the world. Japan has technology that we can leverage on. We can process our mineral resources, go into oil and gas, refine and add value to our agricultural products among others and Nigeria will go places,” he said. Agberankhe said that the business meeting was organized to identify the bottlenecks that were hampering the presence of Japanese companies in the country, chart a way forward as well as develop a road map on economic activities between the two countries. Chief Representative of JICA, Nigeria Office, Katsutoshi Komori said that about 1,800 Nigerians have been to Japan and participated in training programmes on various subjects.  He said that Nigeria was the largest exporter of sesame to Japan, adding that he hoped potential trade between Nigeria would grow.
