Following cases of alleged human rights violations in Turkey, 38 Nobel laureates across the world including Nigeria’s Professor Wole Soyinka, have written an open letter to President Erdogan, demanding for a quick return to the rule of law. The Nobel laureates, in the letter, are also asking for the abrogation of the state of emergency and full freedom of speech and expression in Turkey. The letter reads in part, “We wish to draw your attention to the damage being done to the Republic of Turkey, to its reputation and the dignity and wellbeing of its citizens, through what leading authorities on freedom of expression deem to be the unlawful detention and wrongful conviction of writers and thinkers.” They said the abrogation of the state of emergency and a quick return to the rule of law would result in the speedy acquittal on appeal of Ms Ilıcak and the Altan brothers, and the immediate release of others wrongfully detained.
