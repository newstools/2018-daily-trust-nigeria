A civil society organization, Media Initiative against Injustice, Violence and Corruption -MIIVOC has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to avert Nigeria’s imminent expulsion from the Egmont group of Financial Intelligence Units. MIIVOC’s Executive Director, Dr. Walter Duru, who made the call Wednesday, in Abuja expressed concerns over the development, arguing that it portends grave danger for the nation, if allowed to happen. He said “when expelled, Nigeria will no longer benefit from financial intelligence shared by the other one hundred and fifty-six member-countries, including the United States of America and the United Kingdom, while the country’s ability to recover stolen funds abroad will be hampered.” He therefore called on the National Assembly leadership and President Buhari to act in the interest of the nation.
