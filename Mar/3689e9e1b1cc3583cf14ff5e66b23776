Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, has announced a resolution by traditional rulers to adopt children whose parents were killed by Boko Haram insurgents in the northeast. He announced this at the launching of a book titled “Fath Rabbil Bariyya,” a commentary of the book on the Islamic jurisprudence popularly known as Izziya by Dr Mansur Ibrahim Sokoto yesterday. He said there were over 50,000 orphans at the camps of internally displaced persons across the northeast, who should be catered for by well-meaning Nigerians. “We deliberated on this during our meeting and resolved that each emirate should adopt at least five orphans and train them in order to be useful to themselves, their societies and the country,” he said. The monarch, who described the situation of the orphans as pathetic, urged wealthy individuals to emulate Sokoto-based business tycoon, Alhaji Umarun Kwabo, who adopted and is currently training about 200 of the orphans. Sultan Abubakar commended the author of the book, saying it would go a long way in widening the knowledge of Muslims on Islamic jurisprudence. He enjoined scholars to imbibe the habit of publishing books on the true teachings of Islam in order to save Muslims from being misguided by fake scholars. The book reviewer, Sheikh Aminu Daurawa said the publisher urged scholars to make the book part of the curriculum in their schools because of its enormous importance. Over N40 million was realised during the seminar with the highest share of N12 million coming from the Sokoto State government. Highlight of the seminar was the presentation of awards to the winners of the just concluded quiz competition on Sokoto Caliphate literatures organized by the Sultanate Council in collaboration with Centre for Intellectual Services on Sokoto Caliphate.
