The General Manager of the Federal Capital Territory Water Board, Engr. Aliyu Ahmad Nahuche, has said the board will plant more than 3,000 trees to enhance quality of water distributed to  residents. The Engr. Nahuche said the trees which would be planted upstream around the Mpape catchment would serve as natural purification, while also checking intrusion of unwanted materials into the body of water channelled into the dam. Nahuche who spoke at an event to mark World Water Day yesterday at the Usuma Dam, said despite the challenges of indiscriminate dumping of unwanted items into the dam, the board had put in place measures to ensure residents drank good quality water. “We have a highly technically skilled staff working to ensure that the standard is sustained using the best equipment in the country. Our water is open to everybody to check, I assure all residents that it is safe,” he said. Also, the board’s head of Quality Control, Mrs. Ololade Okobi, urged residents to desist from dumping waste in the dam because wastes like battery was hazardous to health. “Residents should not dump wastes that are hazardous in the water because if they dump them, the rate at which the water comes for treatment may not be able to be eliminated,” said. World Water Day is observed globally and presents an opportunity to learn more about water-related issues to educate the public and to take actions that make a difference in global management of water.
