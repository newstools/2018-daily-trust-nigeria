An Abuja Chief Magistrate Court has acquitted a herbalist of a three-count charge including theft. Monday Sylvanus, 24, a traditional doctor, who is also a bouncer was arraigned on February 6, 2018, before the court for allegedly stealing and committing other offences. The complainant, Miss Owewole Wuruola, had alleged that on February 3, 2018 at Ademola Adetokunbo Crescent by Underground, Wuse 2, Abuja, some unknown hoodlums attacked her and her friends inside her vehicle and made away with her money and other valuables. Wuruola listed the Items stolen as one Samsung Galaxy note valued at N200,000; $100;  40 Euros, two gold necklaces value unknown and one Zenith bank ATM card. “Your worship, during police investigation, the sum of N9,000 was recovered from the accused,” she said. However, the defendant in his defense, told the court that apart from being a traditional doctor, he is a bouncer in one of the clubs in that area. He said he was going home when he saw people gathered at a spot. “I saw people collecting money, I joined them to collect. So, I was surprised when the police stormed my house and arrested me,” he said. After listening to both parties, the Magistrate, Ubani Tony Chukwuemeka  acquitted the accused, saying the evidence provided against him was insufficient to decide otherwise.
