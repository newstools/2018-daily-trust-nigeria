The Chief Medical Director of Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki, Dr. Emeka Ogah, yesterday said the hospital is still attending to fresh cases of Lassa fever since it broke out in the state. He however said the establishment of the virology centre built by the state government and recently handed over to federal government had assisted in arresting the spread. Dr. Ogah disclosed this yesterday in his office while interacting with journalists. “We are still having cases of Lassa fever here but at present victims prefer to be treated here rather than taking them to Irua in Benin. “And we thank the state governor, Engr. David Umahi for providing a virology centre in the state,” he said. Ogah further explained that those under surveillance, suspected cases and patients have be discharged and reunited with their families.
