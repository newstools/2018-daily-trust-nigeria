South Africa’s former president Jacob Zuma was due to appear in court on April 6 to face charges of corruption in a years-old $2.5 billion arms deal, although he will legally challenge the decision to prosecute him, his lawyer said on Monday. The National Prosecuting Authority earlier this month said it would seek to prosecute Zuma on 16 charges, including fraud, racketeering, corruption and money laundering. The case is a dramatic development on a continent where leaders rarely face their accusers in court. “It was served at my Durban offices. The court date is April 6,” Michael Hulley told Reuters by telephone, referring to the summons. He declined to comment on how his client would respond. Zuma is mounting a legal challenge against the NPA’s decision to prosecute him, Hulley said.
