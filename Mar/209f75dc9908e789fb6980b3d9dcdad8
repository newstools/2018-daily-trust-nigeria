The Borno State Government has directed the immediate closure of public boarding secondary schools as part of measures to enhance security. Dr Muhammad Bulama, the Commissioner for Home Affairs, Information and Culture, said this in a statement yesterday in Maiduguri. Bulama said the measure was adopted at the end of an expanded Security Council meeting of security agencies, government and traditional leaders held on March 15. “All boarding secondary schools in the state with the exception of those in Maiduguri and Biu will be closed with immediate effect. Sequel to the unfortunate recent attack on Rann town in Kala-Balge Local Government by Boko Haram, urgent and immediate measures will be taken jointly by the Borno Government, the Nigerian Armed Forces and other security agencies to forestall future occurrences there and in other vulnerable communities,” he said.
