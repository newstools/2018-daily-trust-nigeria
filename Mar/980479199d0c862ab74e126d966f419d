The Practice Manager Africa region of the World Bank, Iffath Sharif, has commended the FCT Community And Social Development Project (CSDP) for utilising its funds on viable projects that have impact on the lives of rural people. Sharif stated this when she inspected CDSP projects at Agyana and Gbogbodo community of Abaji area council on Wednesday. “We are also discussing on strategies not only for communities in FCT, but other communities across other states to see how we can partner with government of Nigeria about ways to provide leverage for people in rural areas,” she said. Also speaking, the task team leader of CSDP in the World Bank office, Mr. Folunsho Ogunmadewa, said the World Bank was quite aware of some communities in the FCT that were demanding for similar projects, assuring that there would be enough resources to reach some communities within the next two years. She said the World Bank was also looking at how government resources itself could be leveraged to a mechanism that seemed to be working and changing peoples lives. “So the issue for is us not actually the monetary terms, what we are bringing in is very small but what the communities are contributing on a longer perspective is  much more than what we are bringing in, “ she said. On his part, the general manager of the FCT CSDP, Dr Adamu Shuaibu, said the office supports such projects with 90 percent while the community brings 10 percent, saying the office only supports such communities to allow them decide their priority project. He said the major challenge for the FCT SCDP was that communities unable to meet their 10 percent obligations in sometimes.
