Liverpool’s strong team spirit is a key factor in the Premier League club’s brilliant run of recent form on the domestic front and in Europe, Senegalese forward Sadio Mane has said. Liverpool have lost just once in the league since October to climb up to third, two points behind second-placed Manchester United, and they are on the verge of sealing a Champions League quarterfinal berth after a big first leg win in Portugal. The Meryseyside club recorded their third victory in four league games on Saturday with a 4-1 thrashing of West Ham United and Mane credits the team’s formidable form to unity.
