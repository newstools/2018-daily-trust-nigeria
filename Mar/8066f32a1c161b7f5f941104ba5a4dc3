A former governor of Kaduna State, Senator Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi, has urged Nigerians to use the Easter period for sober reflection on the life and times of Jesus Christ and his sacrifices. The former governor said this  should be done with a view to imbibing the legacies of humility, forgiveness, tolerance, good neighbourliness, respect and empathy for other people’s feelings. Makarfi conveyed this in an Easter message signed by his media adviser, Mukhtar Zubairu Sirajo, saying it was his firm belief that the application of the virtues taught and lived by Jesus Christ was direly needed now more than any time in the history of the country in the face of poverty, divisiveness and mutual distrust. Senator Makarfi appealed to all Nigerians to, in the spirit of the season, eschew bitterness and recommit to the noble ideal of unity in diversity.
