The Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) has expressed concern over the abduction of the Dapchi schoolgirls saying the continuous abduction of schoolgirls is a potent attempt to frustrate girl child education in Northern Nigeria. The Muslim umbrella body said this in a statement issued yesterday in Kaduna and signed by its Secretary General, Dr Khalid Abubakar Aliyu. The statement said, “JNI under the leadership of its President-General, His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto received with absolute shock and amazement the most unfortunate story of the abduction of school girls at the Government Girls’ Science Technical Secondary School, Dapchi, some kilometres away from Damaturu, Yobe State. “There must be blame for this, and no one found culpable in this gross negligence should be spared. In fact, a serious government would have by now put in jail and suspended all negligent security and political chiefs who could and should have protected these innocent children, rather than the rigmarole setting up of an investigative panel. Which most often than not, such panels/committees’ report end up on shelves, covered in dust.” He added, “Again, why did the Dapchi girls’ abduction happen months before the 2019 general election, just like the Chibok girls’ abduction of 2014? Are there orchestrated plans somewhere to make a case for more security votes? “All of us as parents are still in shock. We must ask: how did the perpetrators gain access to the school? How come they were not prevented or intercepted? Does it mean that when they were coming no security or informants provided any hint?” JNI called on government at all levels to do everything possible and as a matter of urgency to return “our Dapchi and Chibok daughters.”
