The National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has vowed to work against the re-election bid of legislators opposed to local government autonomy bill. The union vowed that it will mobilize its members to vote against states and lawmakers opposed to the local government autonomy bill. Speaking in Umuahia after a meeting with the Abia State House of Assembly Committee on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, the leader of the delegation and National Trustee of NULGE, Comrade Fatai Ibrahim, said the autonomy bill held the key to the development of the grassroots, including ensuring stability in payment of salaries and remunerations of  workers. Ibrahim said a situation in which the third tier of government received its allocation through a third party was not acceptable. He said that was basically responsible for the problem of salary arrears in the local government system and lack of infrastructure in the rural areas. The national trustee who represented the National President of NULGE, Comrade Ibrahim  Khaleel, also said nine out of 12 states assembly had voted in favour of the autonomy and appealed to Abia State House of Assembly to expedite the process of passing the bill.
