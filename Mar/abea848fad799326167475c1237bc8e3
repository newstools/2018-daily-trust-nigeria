The witness who preferred anonymity said: “It is a tradition here that whenever a friend is getting married, his friends will help him excavate soil, mould blocks and build a house for him. That was what took them there and while they were excavating the soil the place collapsed on them. But we later recovered their bodies and gave them a befitting burial”. He prayed Allah to grant their families the fortitude to bear the loss.
