In a statement signed by the Assistant Director in the State Ministry of Justice, Kayode Oyekanmi, the 70 suspected cultists, with ages ranging between 19 and 40 years, were arraigned on a three-count charge by the Directorate of Public Prosecution in the State Ministry of Justice. They were earlier arrested by officers of the State Police command who acted promptly on a tip-off given by members of the public on 23rd February, 2018 at about 2am, where the suspected cultists at Elemoro area of Ajah were caught holding a meeting of the unlawful society of AIYE confraternity.

CH.17 Vol.3, Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Also, in count three, they were said to have attended the meeting of the said unlawful group, contrary to the laws of the State. After the charges were read to them, the 70 defendants pleaded not guilty, while their lawyer urged the court to grant his clients bail on the ground that the offence for which they were charged are bailable. In response, the prosecution team led by Mr. Yakub Oshoala, a Director from the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP), Lagos State Ministry of Justice, did not oppose the bail application, but urged the court to remand the defendants in prison custody pending the satisfaction of their bail conditions.
