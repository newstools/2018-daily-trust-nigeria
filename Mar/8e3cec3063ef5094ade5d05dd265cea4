The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Niger State said it has uncovered a fake registration centre in Zungeru, Wushishi Local Government Area of the state. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Professor Sam Egwu, told Daily Trust on yesterday in Minna that the police, through a tip-off, invaded the centre and arrested the alleged culprit with many temporary voters’ cards. Prof. Egwu said most of the fraudster’s clients were workers of a construction company who requested for voters’ cards or any document to ensure that they were duly registered to vote in the forthcoming elections. “The suspect normally worked on the temporary voters’ card he obtained to produce new ones for unsuspecting clients,” the REC stated. He said the fraudster usually charged certain amount of money before issuing the fake cards. He advised eligible voters to always visit designated INEC registration centres for registration, adding that the commission did not charge money for the exercise. He said the suspect was undergoing interrogation by security agents. The REC further disclosed that 10 new registration centres had been added to the state as a way of encouraging more eligible voters to register. He said a total of 144, 406 eligible voters had so far registered in the ongoing continuous voters’ registration across the state.
