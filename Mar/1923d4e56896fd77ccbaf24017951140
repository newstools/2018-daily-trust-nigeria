The Akwa Ibom Governor’s wife, Mrs Martha Emmanuel, has appealed to women in the country to bear children they could cater for to avoid harsh economic consequences.

Emmanuel said this after her investiture as NANTAP Cultural Ambassador for 2018 at the award night for National Association of Nigerian Theatre Arts Practitioners (NANTAP) tagged, “Uyo 2018” on Saturday night.

She said that the theme of the convention, “Reproductive Health, Family Planning and National Development: The Nigerian Artistes in Promoting a Worthy Cause” was apt as it would sensitise the women on the need to embrace family planning.

She urged the artistes and entertainers to use their profession to conscientise the Nigerian populace on the need to inculcate moral values and build a better society.

“As theatre practitioners, who exhibit various creative skills and talents in drama, singing, dance and creative designs.

“I am very confident that the convergence of instructive messages and advocacies will put health in the building of strong values and ultimately a better society can be achieved using your skills as theatre arts practitioners,” she said.

According to her, If women could take their reproductive healthcare and family planning seriously, it would give them opportunity to engage in meaningful economic and political endeavours.

The governor’s wife noted that the absence of family planning had led to population explosion in the country.

She attributed the menace of bad values such as militancy, armed robbery and terrorism in the country to population explosion without corresponding increase in economic development.
