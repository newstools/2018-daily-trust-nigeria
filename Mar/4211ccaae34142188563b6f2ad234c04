The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed dates for the continuation of the recall process of  Senator Dino Melaye (APC, Kogi West).

INEC's Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kogi State, Prof. James Apam said at a stakeholders' meeting in Lokoja on Wednesday that the move followed the ruling of an Appeal Court in Abuja, which gave the electoral umpire the leave to go on with the recall process. 

Consequently, he said the Commission has fixed Saturday, April 28 as the date for verification of constituents' signatures while Saturday May 5, would be for the conduct of referendum in accordance with provisions of the Electoral Act. 

Prof Apam explained that if the signatures' verification is successfully done, the Commission would then proceed to the next stage where a referendum of all registered voters would be conducted to decide either yes or no. 

According to him, if the "yes" responses meet the constitutional requirements of 51 percent, the process would move to the next stage but if it fails, the process would stop.


Daily Trust reports that the Appeal Court had last week thrown out Senator Dino Melaye's suit challenging the move to recall him.
