Former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senator Ahmadu Ali has urged youths not to be used negatively by politicians. He said this yesterday at the public presentation of his book titled, ‘The Many Colours of a Rainbow: A Biography of Senator Ahmadu Ali’. The book launch, which took place at the Shehu Musa Yar’adua Centre, was chaired by former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, with former head of state, retired General Yakubu Gowon, as Father of the Day. The event also served as a celebration of Senator Ali’s 82nd birthday. Gowon said he was satisfied with the policies the celebrant introduced in that sector. He also described the retired army colonel as “A true Nigerian patriot who served the nation diligently in various capacities without blemish.” Reviewer of the book, Daily Trust’s Deputy Editor-in-Chief, Mahmud Jega, said about the work: “Any Nigerian, especially of my generation, who reads it, will change some misconceptions he held about Senator Ahmadu Ali, especially from the ‘Ali Must Go’ that we were brought up to know, to a new conception of ‘Ali Must Stay for many more years’.” Dignitaries in attendance included; Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa State, a former minister of state for Science and Technology, Pauline Tallen, Professor Jibril Aminu, a former presidential aspirant, Sarah Jibril, amongst others.
