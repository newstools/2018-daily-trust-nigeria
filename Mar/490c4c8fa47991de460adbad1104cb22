The Kogi State Police Commissioner, Ali Janga has given graphic details of how the two suspects who indicted Senator Dino Melaye escaped from custody on Wednesday morning.

The two principal suspects who indicted Senator Melaye in arms dealing but now on the run are Kabiru Seidu, aka Osama and Nuhu Salisu, aka Small. 

Janga alleged "serious connivance" on the part of the 12 of his men who were on guard duty at the time of the incident.

According to him, 12 of his men who were on duty when the incident occurred have been "defaulted" and detained for interrogation. 

He said those found culpable at the end of the investigation would be charged to court. 

"The attention of the commissioner of police was drawn by the DPO 'A' Division that the SARS Cell at the 'A' Division was broken by suspects and 6 suspects escaped. 

"We had about 12 policemen on guard duty; five SARS operatives and seven of our conventional policemen have been rounded up and will be investigated. 

"I was there myself; the padlock to one of the exhibit room through which the suspects escaped was opened. And they used hammers, nail cutters and shovel to hit the iron bar of the window and bent it and removed one of the blocks. 

"And we have two of our SARS policemen behind the cell. Three of them were in the front of the cell apart from our conventional policemen that were doing their duties in the charge room.

"I seriously believe there is a serious connivance and that is why all of them were rounded up. And in the cause of our investigations, if we found anyone of them culpable, no matter how highly placed, they must be brought to book," he said.

He said that the Inspector General of police has sent a special response team from Abuja led by Abba Kyari and assured that the fleeing suspects would be rearrested.
