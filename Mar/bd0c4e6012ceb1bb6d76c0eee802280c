Pakistan’s foreign office has accused India of harassing and intimidating its diplomats and their families posted in New Delhi, in the latest escalation of tensions between the South Asian neighbours. In a statement, the foreign office said Pakistani officials and their families were facing “intense harassment, intimidation and outright violence from the Indian state agencies”. India said it would investigate the allegations. Indian diplomats posted in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, alleged that they had been facing similar harassment for months. Pakistan said at least three of its diplomats, and several of their children, had been harassed in recent days. “This deliberate bullying is not confined to a single isolated event, but continues unabated in a series of incidents, especially targeting the children of our officers and staff,” said the Pakistani statement, listing a series of alleged incidents.
