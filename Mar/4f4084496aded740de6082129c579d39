A Danish man, who was found with women’s genitals in his freezer, has been given two life sentences by a South African court for the rape of a minor and the murder of his wife. Peter Frederiksen was convicted of 36 offences last year, including the production of child pornography. Judge Johann Daffue called Frederiksen manipulative and lacking in remorse for his crimes. Frederiksen apologised to his late wife’s family and to South Africans after the sentencing at Bloemfontein High Court, AFP news agency reports. In 2015, a domestic dispute led to the police finding around 21 pieces of frozen female genitalia in his home, which were neatly labelled in plastic bags with a date, the name of a woman and where she was from.
