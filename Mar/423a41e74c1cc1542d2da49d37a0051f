The Ona of Abaji, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has urged officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in the area to arrest and prosecute anybody caught violating traffic rules and regulations. The Ona, who spoke at a town hall meeting organised by the FRSC Unit 13 Special Marshal held at his palace on Saturday, said even if his son was the offender, he should not be spared. The meeting had representatives of various security agents, motorcycle unions and commercial drivers’ union in attendance. “Anybody who violates traffic rules and regulations and confronts your men that this place is our land, I am giving you directive to arrest and prosecute such a person even if he is my son, “ he said. He said nobody was above the law and since the constitution of the country was one, every individual, no matter how highly placed must respect the law and constituted authorities. Also speaking, the FCT Sector Commander, Ayuba Gora Wobiri, represented by the Yangoji unit commander, Joseph Samgbaza, said  overloading of vehicles and driving against the traffic, were the most prevalent offences committed on the route. He said the corps would not rest on its oars in ensuring that such motorists who float traffic rules were prosecuted. “We have constituted something we call emotional psychological test for drivers who overload and drive against the traffic. If you are arrested, you will be given a form to fill and we will take you to National Hospital where you will be tested whether you are a psychiatric patient, “ he said.
