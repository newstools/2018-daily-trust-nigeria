The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman has compared the leader of Iran to Adolf Hitler.  He said Saudi Arabia would acquire a nuclear bomb “as soon as possible” if Iran developed nuclear weapons. This comment is following the increasingly volatile rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has fueled sectarianism and war across the Middle East. The volatile rivalry result from Sunni monarchy blaming Iran for funding militias to undermine Arab states, while Shiite Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of backing Sunni extremist groups. This rivalry and struggle for regional dominance have killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. His statements were in an excerpt, released on Thursday, of a prerecorded interview with “60 Minutes,” the CBS News program. In the interview, Prince Mohammed, 32, played down Iran’s power, saying its army was not well ranked in the Muslim world and that Saudi Arabia had a larger economy. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program was peaceful and intended to produce only energy and research, not weapons. Saudi Arabia has not been known to seek nuclear weapons, but its cabinet this week approved a policy for a new atomic energy program.
