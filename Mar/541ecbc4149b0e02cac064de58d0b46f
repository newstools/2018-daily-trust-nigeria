The Plateau State Commissioner of Police, Jeremiah Undie, has called on film makers in the country to produce films on farmers-herdsmen clashes in the country, saying such can go a long way towards halting the crises or reducing them to the barest minimum. Speaking at the closing ceremony of the special film training workshop for youths organized by the National Film Institute, Jos, the police commissioner said Nigerians take seriously film messages and that if films can be produced on the need to enhance understanding among the different segments of the population, the peace and unity of the nation would be enhanced. Represented by the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Reuben D. Abibo, Undie said that the problem with film making is that it sometimes dwell on insignificant things rather than meaningful stories that would enhance the society in all ramifications. He urged the film institute to produce quality students that would positively impact on the film industry and bring their professionalism to bear.
