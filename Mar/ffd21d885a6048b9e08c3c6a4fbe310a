The Lagos police command has arraigned in court a middle-aged man it alleged has been posing as a university lecturer. The police said the suspect, who claimed to be Dr Olalekan Kalejaye, had been parading himself as a lecturer with the Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo, to defraud unsuspecting admission seekers. Kalejaye was alleged to have duped the admission seekers of large sums of money on the false pretence he would secure admission for them to study various courses in the school. Police prosecutor, Superintendent Kenneth Asibor, said that the accused had swindled an unstated number of persons millions of naira on the excuse of helping them to secure university admission. Asibor said that luck ran against Kalejaye when a victim, Olabanjo Lola, sighted him within the LASU premises, raised an alarm and the suspect was arrested and handed over to the police at the Ojo division for further investigation. The prosecutor said, “The accused addresses himself as Dr Kalejaye and that he holds a Ph.D degree. During interrogation the accused admitted not being a staff of the university and that he worked through various agents contacted by admission seekers.” He was subsequently charged on Wednesday before the Ejigbo magistrate’s court with fraud. He pleaded not guilty. The presiding magistrate, Mr T.O. Shomade, granted him bail in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum and adjourned case till April 16, 2018. He was remanded in prison custody pending when he will perfect his bail conditions.
