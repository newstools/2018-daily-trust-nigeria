The National Commandant of Peace Corps of Nigeria, Dickson Akoh has described as “unfortunate” the refusal of President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the National Peace Corp Bill, tailored to create employment for Nigeria youths. Akoh stated this yesterday at press a briefing in Abuja. He explained that the functions of the Nigerian Peace Corps as captured in the Bill do not in any way conflict with that of any existing security agencies, against the reason cited by president Buhari on its duplication of roles of existing security agencies. He said, “While we cannot question the wisdom of Mr President, who possesses the prerogative power to assent, we find it quite unfortunate that it came at a time Nigeria urgently needed a huge dose of peace and security. The function of peace corps is absolutely civil, which is set to serve as an arbiter of peace, youth volunteerism, maintaining  and sustaining a level of proactiveness, and couriers of information of impending nefarious activities and plots that can lead to the breakdown of peace and order anywhere in Nigeria.” He further said that the corps functions included genuine youth empowerment and redirecting their creative potentials to the socio-economic and political advancement of the nation. Akoh said that the issue of paucity of fund to run the corps should not be a major factor as there are some international donor agencies ready to provide financial support to run the corps. He said that despite the non assent of the corps, it will continue to exist as an organization and continue to pursue its mission as well as renew its drive to get presidential assent one day.
