The chairman of Gwagwalada area council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, said his administration is focused on completing ongoing capital projects in the area before the end of his tenure. Adamu stated this while inspecting the construction of the road project which is  being  executed by the Satellite Town Development Agency (STDA), of the FCT Administration. He said since his assumption of office he had given priority to projects that have direct bearing on the lives of residents of the area, which he said, included roads, electricity, boreholes and health centres. He noted that such projects have direct impact on the lives of citizens. He said despite the challenge of funds, the council had carried out such projects in various places across the council. “Access roads have been one of the major challenges we have been facing as virtually most of the roads within Gwagwalada metropolis are at dilapidated stage. And that is why on my assumption of office, I decided to give priority to some roads by rehabilitating them,” he said. The chairman commended the FCT administration under the leadership of Muhammad Musa Bello, for his intervention through the STDA in construction of roads in the council. The chairman also inspected the newly completed electrification project at Ibwa II, ongoing Sharia court road project, among other ongoing projects in the area.
