Suspected armed bandits on Tuesday stormed Bawar Daji village in Anka local government area of Zamfara state and killed at least 12 people, Daily Trust gathered. In a chat with Daily Trust  the residents said the horrific assaults on the communities of Duhuwa, Dawan jiya, Gobirawa  and Tungar Daji communities were being masterminded by the man called Gajere.  "Gajere is of Hausa extraction but he later grew up in herders' villages. He has  imbibed the culture of impunity and crime when he joined the gang of cattle rustlers and armed bandits attacking our communities. He was born at Wuya  district of the local government," A resident Ali Mustapha said.  "Gajere took to kidnapping and is the most dangerous kidnapper here. Most of the kidnappings that are taking place in the communities I mentioned are being master minded by him. He collected millions of Naira in ransom and he is still being paid the ransom when ever his gang abducts any resident," he added.  The residents said Gajere is  moving  freely wielding rifles and no one dares to confront him. He is visiting most their communities on motorbike to buy what ever he wants and a resident's  earlier acquaintance with him won't stop him from abducting him/ her  for ransom.
