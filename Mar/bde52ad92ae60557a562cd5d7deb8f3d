One year after a round of violence in Ile-Ife, another clash between the Hausa community and the Yoruba people may have been averted in the town. Daily Trust gathered that some northerners came to Ile-Ife enmasse to do menial jobs and when the Ife indigenes sighted them, there was apprehension. It was learnt that the matter got the attention of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi and he sent some top chiefs to handle the matter but those that he delegated could not manage the situation. The chiefs, according to reliable sources, invited the Sarkin of Arewa community of Sabo Ile-Ife, Alhaji Mahmoud Madagali and mandated him to sign some documents before the northerners could be allowed to stay in Ife but the Sarki declined on the basis that as Nigerians, the northerners should be allowed to stay in Ife. This led to serious altercation. Sources said that the Ile-Ife chiefs were infuriated. Governor, Mr Rauf Aregbesola heard about the matter and set up a committee led by his aide on Ethnic Matters, Bashir Husain, to douse the tension.
