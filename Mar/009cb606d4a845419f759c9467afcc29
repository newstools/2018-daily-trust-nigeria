The United Nations  Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, has condemned the  killing of three aid workers in Rann town in Borno State, north-east  Nigeria last night following an attack by a Non-State Armed Group on the  military facilities next to the town. 

Three aid workers were also injured in the attack and a female nurse is missing.

“Aid  workers put their lives on the line every single day to provide  emergency assistance to vulnerable women, children and men,” said Mr  Kallon. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and  our brave colleagues and we call on authorities to ensure the  perpetrators are brought to justice and account.”

Two  deceased aid workers were contractors with the International  Organization for Migration, working as coordinators in the camp for  55,000 internally displaced persons who have fled their homes as a  result of the ongoing conflict. 

The other deceased aid worker was a medical doctor employed as a third party consultant with UNICEF. 

The United Nations also expressed concerns about other civilians who may have been injured or killed in the attack.

The  humanitarian crisis in Nigeria’s north-east, that has spilled over into  the Lake Chad region, is one of the most severe in the world today,  with 7.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 in  the worst-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, and 6.1 million  targeted for humanitarian assistance. 

Now  in its ninth year, the crisis shows no sign of abating. Close to 80,000  people, including 55,000 internally displaced persons, currently reside  in Rann and are supported with humanitarian assistance.
