President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday told the Federal Executive Council why he cancelled his trip to Kigali, Rwanda, for the signing of the agreement framework for the African Union Continental Free Trade Area. Buhari said the AfCTA agreement has the capacity to hinder local entrepreneurship and encourage the dumping of finished goods in Nigeria. The president also stated that Nigeria was yet to fully understand the economic and security implications of the agreement. He, therefore, constituted a committee comprising the Ministers of Finance, Budget, Labour, Foreign Affairs, Science and Technology as well as the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Nigerian Customs Service and the Nigerian Immigration Service to review the content of the AfCFTA proposals and look at its security implications. Addressing State House reporters after the council meeting, presidential spokesman Mr Femi Adesina said: “The committee which has two weeks to submit its report will be expected to look at the security implications of the agreement.” Last week, the FEC had last at a meeting chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had resolved that Buhari should sign the AfCFTA agreement framework. The president, however, cancelled his scheduled trip on Sunday after some of his advance team members had arrived Kigali.
