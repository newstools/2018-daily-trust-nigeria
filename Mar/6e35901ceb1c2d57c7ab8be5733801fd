Chairman of the Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi-led faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna State, Alhaji Danladi Wada has not been seen since he left home around 5:30 am on Saturday. Wada is the chairman of the faction that opened a parallel secretariat of the party at No.11 Sambo Road, Kaduna and signed the statement declaring the address as the new secretariat of the party in the state. The secretariat was later demolished by an agency of the state government on grounds that the owner of the property defaulted in the payment of ground rent. A family member who made this known to our correspondent said it was unusual as the man usually returns home after saying his prayers at the mosque. “But the case is different today because he did not come home more than 12 hours after he left home,” he said Wada was said to have left his Ungwan Rimi GRA residence in Kaduna on Saturday at about 5:30am for prayers in a nearby mosque. One of his sons, Abdulmumuni Wada confirmed the incident on telephone noting that the family suspects that his father may have been abducted as all efforts to trace his whereabouts have not been unsuccessful. He said his father went to the mosque without his phones and that makes it very difficult to locate him. The Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), Mukhtar Hussain Aliyu, when contacted said a person can only be declared missing if he has not been seen for 24 hours but promised to check with the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the area. Senators Hunkuyi through his media aide also confirmed that Wada has not been seen since he left home yesterday morning.
