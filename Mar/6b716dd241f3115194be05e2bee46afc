President Muhammadu Buhari says he is as committed to the freedom of the only Dapchi schoolgirl still in captivity as he was to the girls' freedom when all 110 were in the captivity of Boko Haram terrorists. Buhari, in a statement on Thursday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity Malam Garba Shehu, said his administration would not relent in efforts to bring Leah Sharibu safely back home to her parents as it has done for the other girls after she was held back by the terrorists over her decision, as reported, not to convert from Christianity to Islam. Buhari said he was fully conscious of his duty under the constitution to protect all Nigerians, irrespective of faith, ethnic background or geopolitical location and would not shirk in this responsibility. He said he was equally mindful of the fact that true followers of Islam all over the world respect the injunction that there is no compulsion in religion. "To this effect, no one or group can impose its religion on another," the president said, emphasising that "the lone Dapchi girl, Leah, will not be abandoned." He said his heart went out to the isolated parents who must watch others rejoice while their own daughter was still away. HeÂ assured the Sharibu family that he would continue to do all he could to ensure that they also had cause to rejoice with their daughter soon.
