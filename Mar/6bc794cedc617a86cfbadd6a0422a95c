The PDP, yesterday, said President Muhammadu Buhari’s statement that he was not aware the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, did not fully relocate to Benue as he directed shows incompetence. The party in a statement yesterday through its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said ýýthe statement by Buhari was also an admission that the president had “handed over power to a cabal.” The party argued that, “Stating that he was unaware that the IGP only spent 24 hours in Benue State, Mr. President has confirmed that he has not been effectively monitoring the handling of the security situation of our nation. “The APC and supporters of the president should take their minds off the Aso Villa ahead of 2019 now that their leader and sole candidate has practically admitted his incompetence to run an effective government as desired by Nigerians.”
