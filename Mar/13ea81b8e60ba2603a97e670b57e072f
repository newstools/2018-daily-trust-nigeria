Lagos State Governor Akinwumi Ambode has said unless he takes over the National Theater in Iganmu and the National Stadium in Surulere, his goal for Surulere cannot be achieved. Ambode said this at the commissioning of Modele road in Surulere, rehabilitated by the House of Representatives leader, Femi Gbajabiamila. He said: “I want to bring back nightlife 100 percent to Surulere because the real entertainment started here. “Our vision is to have Surulere compete with Victoria Island and Ikoyi.” The road commissioning coincided with the 88birthday anniversary of the Mother of Hon. Gbajabiamila. The house leader said he was motivated to undertake the project as a token of support to the state government, noting that the road was last tarred in 1981.
