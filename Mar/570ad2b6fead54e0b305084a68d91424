The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has disclosed that vigilantes and hunters will be accommodated in the security architecture of the state to assist in maintaining order. Obaseki disclosed this at the security town hall meeting with security chiefs, elders and members of various communities at Ugboha, Esan South East Local Government Area Secretariat, Ubiaja, after the killing of three people in the area by bandits. He said the new security measure was intended to forestall breakdown of law and order, adding that the new initiative would be supported with 36 operational vehicles to be supplied by the 18 local government councils of the state. “We are incorporating vigilante groups in the new security arrangement. We are going to have a police force that is highly mobile and integrated with the community arrangements, whether they are vigilantes or hunters. This is to ensure that if there are suspicious movements, the information will be sent across promptly,” he said.
