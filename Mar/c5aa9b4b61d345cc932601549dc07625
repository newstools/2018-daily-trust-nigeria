Egypt’s National Election Authority has warned that eligible voters who do not vote in the on-going presidential election will be fined 500 Egyptian pounds ($28; £20), the state-run Channel One TV reports. More than 59 million Egyptians are eligible to vote in the three-day presidential election that began on 26 March. The country’s incumbent president, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, is widely expected to win a second term in the controversial polls. Meanwhile, Egyptian government has dismissed reports that former Prime Minister Lieutenant General Ahmed Shafik was imprisoned or forced out of presidential race. The 76-year-old ex-air force commander was, on Tuesday, seen casting his ballot in the presidential election. In January, he announced his decision to withdraw from the presidential race, citing his long absence from the country.
