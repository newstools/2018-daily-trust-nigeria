A celebration of the Lunar New Year is becoming increasingly popular among Nigerians, especially those in Abuja, thanks largely to the efforts of the Korean Cultural Centre in Nigeria. The centre, established in 2010 has since marked the beginning of every lunar year with festivities and games, drawing a mix audience of Nigerians and Koreans resident in Nigeria. The day, called Seollal in Korean, coincides with the beginning of the lunar new year, which is the popular calendar in the east from Arabia to the Orient. It comes much latear than the Gregorian New Year. This year, the day was celebrated February 18, and the KCCN did not miss the opportunity to host Nigerians and Koreans to its line up events. As has become customary, the celebrations feature a short course on the rituals and practices of the Seollal day celebrations as practiced in Korea, including the traditional Korean greeting, the ‘sebae’ reciprocated with cash gifts. Thereafter, guests at the event were treated to board games that Korean families enjoy on such days. Many Nigerians tried their hands at games like yutnori, jegichagi and tuho. The games excited participants such as Faith Dada. “It is a great experience, full of activities especially the games,” she said. She also praised the Koreans for trying to carry everyone along in their celebrations, saying, “Everyone is involved in one game or the other. I really feel that in Nigeria we should try to carry everybody along. I will say a very big thank you because this is a very big lovely experience.” For Seyi Adekoya, it was a fun and learning experience. “I have been involved in Korean programmes and you get to learn a lot of things about their culture and it is really interesting coming here to learn about their culture,” she said.
