The Presidency yesterday urged the Senate to lift ban on confirmation of nominees of President Muhammadu Buhari pending before it. Presidential Adviser on National Assembly (Senate), Senator Ita Enang made the call during the screening of two nominees for deputy governors of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and four members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The Senate had last year placed an embargo on confirmation of nominees of the President not captured in the Constitution. The embargo followed a remark by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on confirmation of the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu. Until last week when the Senate lifted ban on the confirmation of the CBN nominees, over 40 appointees of the President were awaiting Senate confirmation. Enang told members of the Senate committee on Banking, Insurance and other financial institutions chaired by Senator Rafiu Ibrahim (APC, Kwara) to prevail on their colleagues to extend similar gesture to other nominees of the president. “Thank you for lifting what appeared to be an injunction. I know that with the magnanimity of the Senate, you will extend that gesture to other nominees, particularly the CBN board members,” he said. Those who were screened are Aisha Ahmad (Deputy Governor), Edward Adamu (Deputy Governor) and four members of the MPC namely Professor Adeola Festus Adenikinju; Dr Aliyu Rafindadi Sanusi; Dr Robert Chikwendu Asogwa and Dr Asheikh A. Maidugu.
