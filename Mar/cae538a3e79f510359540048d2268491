The Defence Headquarters has debunked the claim by the Deputy Senate President Senator Ike Ekweremadu that the Army could take over power, saying the "Military has no political ambition."

The Miliatry's response was contained in a statement signed by the Acting Director of Defence Information, Brigadier General J.A Agim and distributed by PRNigeria- a Press Releases distribution platform- on Thrsday night.

"The Defence Headquarters wish to state clearly that, the Nigerian Military has come of age and is in tune with best international military practices of complete and total subordination to democratic governance," he said.

Senator Ekweremadu on Wednesday 7 March 2018, while contributing to a debate on a motion sponsored by Senator Ahmed Ogembe, representing Kogi Central, had stated: “The Problem in Nigeria is that our democracy is receding. Who says army cannot take over, let us not joke with our democracy that is the issue”.

But the Military said while the comment may appear cautionary and sincere in the atmosphere of discourse, it was however derogatory to the Army used in the expression and by extension to the Armed Forces of Nigeria. 

"The statement in the true sense has the capacity to denigrate the Nigerian Military in every ramification including its loyalty to the President Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and the confidence of the general public to defend Nigeria’s democracy."

It assured the public that the Military will continue to support Nigeria's democracy.
