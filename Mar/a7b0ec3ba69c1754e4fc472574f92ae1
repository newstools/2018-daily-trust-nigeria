Paulo Dybala will sign a new five-year contract worth £120,000-a-week with Juventus, putting an end to reports suggesting his future lies elsewhere.

Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid are among the game's heavyweight clubs interested in his signature.

But it appears they will have to look for other options as his new deal until 2023 will not have a release clause.

Dybala, 24, started the season in sensational fashion with 13 goals in his first eight matches — including two hat-tricks.

However, his form soon dipped and he even found himself on the bench.

Furthermore, Barcelona look to be on the verge of signing Antoine Griezmann in the summer, so that door is shut.

The new deal will give him parity with Juventus' top earner in Gonzalo Higuain, as the club demonstrate just how much they value him.

Dybala made his first start in nearly two months against Lazio at the weekend and showed his class, with the winning goal in the final seconds of the match.

He joined Juventus from Palermo for £28.5million in 2015.
