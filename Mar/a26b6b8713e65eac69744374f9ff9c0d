Rivers State Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike yesterday swore in 15 Local Government Caretaker Committee Chairmen who were screened and confirmed by the state House of Assembly. Speaking after the swearing-in ceremony at the Government House Port Harcourt, Governor Wike charged the chairmen to pay the salaries of December 2017, January 2018 and February 2018. He said the funds were not released to the immediate past council administrators because their tenures had expired. He said: â€œThe payment of salaries of workers must be given priority attention. As you take over the councils, pay the outstanding three months salaries. Governor Wike charged the urban local government areas to focus on sanitation of different suburbs, and engage the youths to promote environmental sanitation. He said any chairman involved in using council funds to service his political godfather will be sanctioned.
