The Democratic Republic of Congo has discovered that more than 200 magistrates have been working under false qualifications. A commission of inquiry that was established last October investigated more than 3,000 magistrates and found that more than 200 should not be working. Speaking to reporters, the Justice Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba said that some of the magistrates had been arrested while others had disappeared. Human rights groups have frequently criticised the country’s justice system as corrupt while Mr Mwamba said last year that it was “infected by several ills”.
