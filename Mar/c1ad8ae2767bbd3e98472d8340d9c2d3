The African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) and the Nigeria Natural Resource Charter (NNRC) have urged the National Assembly to legislate on the enabling laws for the Excess Crude Account (ECA) as it was done for the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA). The Programme Coordinator of the NNRC Ms. Tengi George-Ikoli made the plea yesterday in Abuja at the official launch of the 56-page “Research Review of Crude Oil Sales and Reserve Management in Nigeria vis-a vis the Social and Economic Benefits for its People”. According to her the ECA though believed to be mismanaged should rather be harnessed for its benefit as was done to the NSIA which she said has been beneficial despite initial challenges. “Such legislation would remove the loopholes and strengthen the operations of the ECA in such a way that it would not be prone to abuse or corruption,” she said/ On the research project, George-Ikoli said that 60 years after crude oil was discovered in Nigeria, oil activities continue to dominate the economy and revenues. She however laments that very little is known about how much oil is produced as it was shrouded in secrecy in the leading to continuous rise in corruption especially in the offshore operation of the oil and gas sector.
