A House of Representatives panel yesterday queried the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) over N7.6 billion the apex bank took from the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and refunded to some agencies of government without approval. The panel headed by Abubakar Nuhu Danburam (APC, Kano) said the CBN unilaterally refunded the amount to the agencies through another platform known as T24, instead of using the Remita platform, even when the money was still a subject of an investigation. At a meeting with the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, officials of the CBN as well as other stakeholders, the panel asked if the accountant general was aware of the transaction. But Idris, who also represented Adeosun, said he was not aware. He however called on the director of TSA in his office, Sylva Okolebo to explain what transpired. Okolebo said the amount was taken from SystemSpecs, the firm that provided the Remita platform, based on a directive by a probe panel which said the firm must refund all it got as fees from charges made on TSA. Thus, the panel demanded the CBN to provide the list of all MDAs that got the refund, the amount they got and how the apex bank arrived at the decision within 48 hours.
