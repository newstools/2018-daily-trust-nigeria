An indigene of Imo State, Uju Pious Ejikeonye, said to be a student of the City University in Malaysia, died after jumping from the 13th floor of an apartment at Desa Aman Puri, Gombak, Kuala Lumpur. A story circulating among the Nigerian community in the area said he jumped in a bid to escape arrest while another said he was running away from immigration officers who were conducting raids in his area on Sunday. Malaysian police however said Uju was indeed trying to evade arrest as he was being investigated over alleged involvement in a crime. According to police chief, ACP Ali Ahmad at Gombak District police headquarters, Uju was fingered as one of the suspects who allegedly defrauded a 58-year-old woman of RM13, 200 through a parcel scam. He said two suspects had already been arrested in one of the raids in connection with the crime and information gathered led the police to Uju’s apartment. “The police arrested a Nigerian man and a Filipino woman earlier, but another Nigerian evaded arrest and was believed to have jumped  off the 13th floor of the condominium,” the police chief said. He said the police were only investigating the suspects’ alleged involvement in the case and Uju’s action was highly surprising and uncalled for. He revealed that three suspects in the case were in Malaysia on student visa while one was on social visa.
