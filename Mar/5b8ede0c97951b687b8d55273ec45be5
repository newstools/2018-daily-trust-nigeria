The son of Angola’s ex-President José Eduardo dos Santos has been formally accused of fraud over the alleged illegal transfer of $500m (£350m) from the central bank to the UK. José Filomeno dos Santos is also barred from leaving the country, deputy Attorney General Luis Benza Zanga said. Mr Dos Santos is the highest profile person targeted in new President João Lourenço’s anti-corruption drive. He had led oil-rich Angola’s sovereign wealth fund during his father’s rule. However, he was removed from this role in January, months after a BBC investigation into Angola’s $5bn fund and following an internal governance review.
