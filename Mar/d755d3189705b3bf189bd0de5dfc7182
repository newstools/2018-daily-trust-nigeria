  The United Nations has condemned the killing of three aid workers in Rann, Borno state last Thursday. The workers, two camp coordinators working with the International Organisation for Migration and a doctor contracted to UNICEF, were killed when insurgents attacked military facilities next to the twon. Three others were also injured in the attack. And a female nurse is missing. It is feared she was abducted, the UN said in a statement. “Aid workers put their lives on the line every single day to provide emergency assistance to vulnerable women, children and men,” said the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and our brave colleagues and we call on authorities to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice and account.” The medical charity Doctors Without Borders suspended work in the town a day after the attack and evacuated 22 national and international staff. Photos have emerged of wounded workers and the bodies of the dead being evacuated by helicopter from Rann. Around 3,000 aid workers work in the northeast, many of them Nigerians. The UN also raised concern about other civilians who may have been injured or killed in the attack. In January last year, at least 52 aid workers and civilians were killed in Rann when an airforce jet accidentally bombed a camp for displaced people while attempting to fire at Boko Haram terrorists. Around 80,000 people, 55,000 of them internally displaced, live in Rann and are supported with humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian crisis in the north east has spilled over into the Lake Chad region, becoming one of the most severe in the world, with 7.7 million people in need of assistance this year alone in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. But only 6.1 million may be reached, according to targets for humanitarian assistance.
