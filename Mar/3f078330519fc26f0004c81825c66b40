A top member of the APC, Chief Anike Nwoga, has filed a suit at the Federal High Court in Enugu challenging the bill passed by the National Assembly which changed the sequence of the 2019 elections. Nwoga, who is the Zonal Vice Chairman of APC in Enugu East Senatorial District, filed the suit on Friday, March 2, 2018, through his lawyer, Godwin Onwusi Esq. In his motion on notice supported by a 25-paragraph affidavit, Nwoga prayed the court for an interlocutory injunction restraining the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria from assenting to the bill passed by the National Assembly changing the sequence of the 2019 elections when it is presented to him for assent pending the determination of the substantive suit. The motion on notice was brought pursuant to Orders 26 and 28 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2009; and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. Besides the National Assembly which was listed as the first defendant/respondent, others listed as second and to fourth defendants/respondents were INEC, the President of Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation (AGF). Aside the prayer for interlocutory injunction restraining the president from assenting to the bill, Nwoga also prayed for an order of interlocutory injunction restraining the National Assembly from overriding the presidentâ€™s veto should he decide to veto the bill. A date was yet to be fixed for the hearing of the suit.
