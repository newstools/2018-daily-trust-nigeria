The Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo, has commended the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, for setting up a committee to tour the area councils and address the issue of farmers-herders clashes in the territory. Shaban made the commendation during a sensitization visit of the ministerial committee on herders and farmers clashes at his palace on Thursday, led by the secretary, FCTA Social Development Secretariat, Alhaji Oladimeji Ali Hassan.

Earlier, the secretary, Social Development Secretariat who is the chairman of the ministerial committee, told the traditional ruler that efforts are on to ensure that issues involving herders and farmers are amicably addressed by the committee. He also commended the traditional ruler for efforts towards enhancing peaceful coexistence among his subjects, especially herdsmen and farmers in his chiefdom, disclosing that the committee had been mandated to have an interface with both farmers and herdsmen at the grassroots.
