Chairman, National Hajj Commission (NAHCON), Barrister Abdullahi Mukhtar Saturday disclosed that all intending pilgrims who have performed the hajj exercise in the last two years will  pay a levy  of  2000 Saudi Riyals, equivalent of over N163,000, exclusive  of  the substantive hajj  fare. He also revealed that following the introduction of biometric data capturing by the Saudi Arabian authorities, three data capturing centres had been opened in Kano, Lagos and Abuja. According to him, efforts were on by the commission to ensure more centres were opened in Nigeria. Speaking  in Sokoto at a sensitization campaign organized by the Commission for prospective pilgrims and officials of the Pilgrims Welfare Agencies from Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara States on 2018 Hajj, he said the levy was not part of  the substantive hajj  fare   which is yet to be announced by the federal government. The chairman who was represented by the National Commissioner in Charge of Operations, Alhaji Abdullahi Modibbo Sale, also disclosed that the Saudi Arabian authorities had introduced a five per cent Value Added Tax on all services, excluding food items and medical drugs. He said the campaign was to inform prospective pilgrims on the need to ensure the completion of their hajj fares on or before the end of March, 2018. Mukhtar explained that early completion of the payment of the hajj fares by the prospective pilgrims would enable the commission and the various pilgrims’ welfare agencies, to make early and efficient arrangements.
