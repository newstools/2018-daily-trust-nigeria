Ethiopia’s ruling coalition has elected Abiy Ahmed as its new chairman, according to state media. The announcement on Tuesday by state broadcaster FANA means that Ahmed, who hails from the Oromo ethnic group, is now expected to succeed Hailemariam Desalegn as Ethiopia’s prime minister. The chairman of the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition has historically also taken on prime minister duties. The EPRDF and its allies control all 547 seats in Ethiopia’s parliament, which must confirm the new prime minister. In a surprise move on February 15, Hailemariam announced that he was stepping down as both prime minister and chairman of the EPRDF.
