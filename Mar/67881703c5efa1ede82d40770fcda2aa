The Nigerian Optometric Association (NOA) has concluded plans  to offer free quality eye treatment to 40,000 children nationwide as part of activities marking the 50th anniversary of the association. National president of the association, Dr. Damian Echendu, said the initiative was part of its corporate social responsibility aimed at improving  eyesight and reducing avoidable blindness among children. In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja after the launch of the initiative ‘My Sight, My Right’ in Owerri, Imo State at the weekend, the president said the target was to increase access to free and comprehensive eye examination. Echendu explained that the scheme would provide  40,000 children between the ages of 5 to 14 with quality and easy access to free eye care. He said since the establishment of the association in 1968, it had made inroads and entrenched itself in the healthcare sector both in the private and public healthcare systems. He stated that ‘My Sight, My Right’ is a fully self-sponsored CSR project pioneered by the Nigerian Optometric Association, the umbrella body of all optometrists practising in Nigeria.
