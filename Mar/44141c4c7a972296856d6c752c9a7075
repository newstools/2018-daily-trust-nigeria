The Nigerian Army University, when established, will admit 75 percent civilians and only 25 percent military and paramilitary officers, an official has said. Chairman of the school’s implementation committee, Major-General Mathias Efeovbokhan (rtd) who led a delegation on a visit to the Minister of Interior Abdulrahman Dambazau yesterday, disclosed that the university had mandates different from those of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). “This university will become solution centre. It will groom graduates with distinctive expertise,” he said. While noting that the higher institution would be research intensive, Efeovbokhan also said it will be the first green university in Africa. He said the university which is to be situated in Biu, Borno State would have the best brains as students, adding that “we will not have students unionism and ASUU.” He assured that there will be adequate security for students and all members of the university community in spite the Boko Haram attacks in the state. Dambazau assured that the ministry will fully support the approval of the university.
