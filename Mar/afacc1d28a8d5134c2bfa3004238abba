The House of Representatives has commenced the process of amending the Nigerian Extradition Act 2004. The move is to align with new developments in international law and global best practices, Chairman House Committee on Justice, Razaq Atunwa (Kwara) said. He made the disclosure yesterday during a one-day public hearing on “A bill to amend the Extradition Act CAP E25, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.” He said the amendment was necessary to ensure that justice is done to all Nigerian citizens irrespective of their places of residence. “This amendment is to ensure that justice is done to Nigerians not only in Nigeria but wherever they may be,” Atunwa stated. Black’s Dictionary of Law defines Extradition as “A formal legal process by which a criminal suspect held by one government is handed over to another government for trial or, if the suspect has already been tried and found guilty, to serve his or her sentence.” Declaring the hearing open, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, represented by the Deputy Minority Leader, Chukwuka Onyem said the amendment is in line with Section 36 (9) of the Constitution of Nigeria as amended.
