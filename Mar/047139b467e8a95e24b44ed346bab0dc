A police patrol team from Zone 3 Division of the FCT command has arrested two members of a syndicate which specializes in vandalizing bridge protectors and stealing manholes’ covers along high ways in Abuja. City News gathered that the suspects were arrested on Monday around Ahmadu Bello way near ECWA Church Wuse 2,  Abuja. A scavenger, Ibrahim Isa and his accomplice, Ahmed Abdullahi, were nabbed in the process of removing a manhole. A source at the division said four of the items already removed were recovered from the suspects’ cart. The police source said the incident was coming two days after another syndicate of vandals were nabbed around the Wuse Market area, while in the process of removing a bridge’s protector. “Items comprising aluminum railings that use to protect the pedestrians from falling off the bridge, were recovered along with some solar power panels, while the vandals took to their heels, running under the bridge on sighting a police patrol team,” he said. When contacted, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of Wuse Zone 3, CSP Joseph Mamman, who confirmed the incidents, said the police were making efforts to locate those who buy the items. He said one of the two suspects had been handed over to the FCT police command’s CID for further investigation.
