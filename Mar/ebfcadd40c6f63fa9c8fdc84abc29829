An agreement to boost the economic growth and development of the southeast was reached yesterday as five governors of the zone agreed to undertake the construction of ring road covering about 430 kilometers that would connect all the states of the zone. This was made known by South East Governors’ Forum chairman and Ebonyi state governor, David Umahi who addressed newsmen shortly after their meeting at Government House, Enugu. He said that the ring road would also ease transportation system in the region, especially for goods and services. Daily Trust reports that the idea of constructing the ring road is being nurtured as a result of the apparent failure of the rail transportation in the zone, and also considering the huge agricultural activities by the people of the area  and high volume of traffic in the zone. Governor Umahi, who noted that the governors were thinking on boosting the power sector in the zone through gas pipelines, said that already a presentation had been taken from Consultants on the project. According to him,  the meeting resolved to follow up on details of implementation especially as it relates to right of way for the gas pipeline project, a development that would provoke industrial revolution in the various states of the southeast.
