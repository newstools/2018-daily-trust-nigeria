The coach of Mighty Jets of Jos, Bernard Ogbe has disclosed that the National League side will conclude preparations for the new season with a friendly match against Gombe United tomorrow. One of the oldest clubs in Nigerian football, Mighty Jets are in Group A2 of the 2018 NNL season along with ABS, Aklosendi, Kaduna United, Kogi United, NAF Rockets and Taraba FC. According to the NNL, two clubs from the group will qualify for the Super 8 from where four clubs would be promoted to the Nigeria Professional Football League. In a chat with Daily Trust on Saturday, the experienced gaffer said so far Mighty Jets have played 17 pre-season matches with encouraging results. He said going by their preparations, he is hopeful that his team will do well in the league which is billed to kick-off next weekend. “So far so good, we are about to round up our preparations. We have lined up our final pre-season match against Gombe United on Sunday. “We just returned from Katsina State where we played two friendly matches to test the players we have assembled for the new season. “I have scouted for very young players who are eager to make a name for themselves and the club so I believe we shall do well,” he said. Ogbe also acknowledged the threat posed by other experienced campaigners like ABS, Kaduna United, Taraba FC and Kogi United but said Mighty Jets are not perturbed.
