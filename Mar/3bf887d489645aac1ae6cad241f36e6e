The governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has hit at Senator Dino Melaye for mocking him in a recent video, describing the lawmaker as a noisemaker. He said this in an interview with State House correspondents on Thursday. He said: "Kogi state is a very complex state and I took it over when things were really bad and I'm doing my best to ensure that we give quality service to the good people of Kogi state. So, any noisemaker out there is just disturbing himself. So, I just focused on the job as the executive governor of Kogi state, and I'm doing my best and the people of Kogi state really appreciate my services to them.” He described the recent killings in his state as very pathetic situation "where about 12 people were killed and I visited that place. It is a place that was neglected by their own people and it was unfortunate that that incident happened and we have constituted Judicial Panel of Inquiry to look into the immediate and remote cause of that attack because this is not the first time that an attack is happening in that particular area. “In 2014 it happened where lives and property were destroyed but thank God with the support of the military, police and other security agencies were able to quickly move into action and then that particular incident had been stopped.
