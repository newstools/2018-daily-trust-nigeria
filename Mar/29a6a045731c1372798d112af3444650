President Muhammadu Buhari will not attend the extraordinary meeting of African Union Heads of State and Government billed to hold in Kigali, Rwanda, Wednesday. 

Reliable sources at the Presidency disclosed Saturday that Buhari’s trip had been canceled. 

The president, it was learnt,  had been scheduled to depart Nigeria for Kigali on Monday for the signing of the framework agreement for establishing the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA). 

The reason for the cancelation of the President Buhari's trip is not yet known. 

The first set of his advance team is already in Kigali; while the second one, comprising protocol staff, security officers and journalists were today asked to return from Murtala International Airport, Lagos, where they were to take off. 

When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu directed our correspondent to the Presidential spokesman,  Mr Femi Adesina, for enquiry. 

Mr Adesina's phone was switched off as of the time of filing this report. 

The Federal Executive Council had Wednesday approved that Nigeria sign the framework agreement for the AfCFTA. 

The council had also approved that Nigeria express her interest in hosting the secretariat of the AfCFTA. 

The decision to establish the AfCFTA was taken in 2012 by all Heads of State and Government of the African Union at their 18th Ordinary Session. 

AfCFTA is the first step in the implementation of AU Agenda 2063: the “Vision” for an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa.
