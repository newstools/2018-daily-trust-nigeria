Irrigation farmers in Yobe State say the state can provide at least 40 per cent of Nigeria’s food needs, if the partnership between the Yobe government and MardiCorp, a Malaysian firm, is properly executed.

They also indicated their interest to partner the state government in the project, especially in its special irrigation scheme.

The farmers’ spokesman, Alhaji Modu Gashua told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gashua on Friday that the partnership would significantly boost food production and economic growth.

AbduKareem Usman, another irrigation farmer, said that Yobe had the capacity to make a 40-percent contribution to the nation’s food stock.

“This partnership will provide more opportunities to improve food production; there is no doubt that this state can contribute 40 per cent of Nigeria’s food requirements.

“This initiative is a welcome development, as it will boost the country’s agricultural growth and development,” Usman said.

In a statement, Abdullahi Bego, the Director-General (Media and Publicity) to Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam, said that partnership with the Malaysian company would also focus on the Special Irrigation Scheme at Nguru Lake, Boloram, Mugura and Garin Gada.

He said that Gaidam was in Malaysia to explore the partnership and engage the services of MardiCorp in training of extension workers and irrigation farmers.(NAN)
