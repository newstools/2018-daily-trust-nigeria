The Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) says it is putting measures in place to check the increasing theft of metal covers of manholes in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). AEPB Head of Information and Outreach, Mr. Muktar Ibrahim, said this on Thursday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Ibrahim called on security agencies to apprehend those who engaged in the theft of the covers, which were purportedly sold to blacksmiths who redesigned them into other products. He said the board had made available mobile courts for the immediate trial of culprits who were apprehended for removing the covers. He further said as part of measures to stem the rising wave of theft of the covers, AEPB had instructed its engineers to fabricate less attractive covers that would discourage thieves. “Manhole cover is a removable plate that is made to prevent people or waste from falling into the manhole. Open manholes allow some environmental unfriendly persons to dump garbage inside the holes,’’ he said.
