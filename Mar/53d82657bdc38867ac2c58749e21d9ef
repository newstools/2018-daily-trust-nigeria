The intervention include relief materials, food aid, health services, supporting education and providing means of decent living for displaced persons in the Northeast. The delegates from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were specifically from the Saudi Fund for Development and the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre. The delegation was led by Mr Nasir Bin Mutlak, the assistant director, Emergency Aid Department of Saudi Arabia, Mr Khalid Bin Abdulraham Al Mani and Mr Muhammed Bin Addidah Al Namla. Mr Mutlak said the assistance was to compliment the Federal Government efforts in the Northeast.
