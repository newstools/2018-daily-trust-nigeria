A 25-year-old fashion designer, Habibu Muhammed and one John James Adamu, 32, have been arraigned before an Abuja chief magistrate’s court sitting in Wuse zone 6 for allegedly stealing iphone 6. The accused, who both reside at Area One by Dunamis Church, Abuja, were arraigned on a two-count charge bothering on joint act, theft and receiving stolen property before Magistrate Ubani Chukwuemeka. The police prosecutor, G. J Ayenna, earlier told the court that on March 10,  2018, Mr Chidi Innoncent Elekwe, the complainant of Computer Village Zone 1, Abuja, put a distress call to Shaibu Yunusa, an ASP at Wuse Zone 3, that the accused stole the iPhone 6 valued at N90,000. Ayenna said Muhammed took the handset to computer village and sold it for N70,000 without receipt. Ayenna added that during police investigation, the accused could not give satisfactory account of the phone. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The first defendant, Habibu Muhammed, a fashion designer, told the court that  a customer used the phone as a collateral and that since the said customer did not show up, he decided to sell the phone. The magistrate granted the defendants bail with one surety who must be a civil servant and who must not be less than grade level 6 in any federal establishment residing within the court. The case was adjourned till April 19, 2018.
