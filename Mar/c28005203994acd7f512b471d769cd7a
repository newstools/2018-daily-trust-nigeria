The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has denied being part of the Northern Groups Summit (NGS) that was reported to have passed a vote of no confidence on northern leaders. In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Muhammad Ibrahim Biu, ACF said it was neither involved in the preparation nor participated in the said summit and did not mandate any of its members to represent the forum. “ACF acknowledges the rights of individuals or groups to freedom of association as enshrined in our constitution. Any member who claimed to have represented ACF or signed on behalf of the forum did so on his own,” the ACF stated. The forum said the views expressed in the said communiqué were those of the conveners and not ACF, which described itself as “an umbrella body for all northerners irrespective of political, ethnic and religious persuasions.” “The ACF will address the North and the nation on this and similar issues as it always does at the appropriate time,” the statement stated. Some leaders under the auspices of Northern Groups Summit (NGS) had on Saturday in Kaduna passed a vote of no confidence on politicians of northern extraction, saying most of them had failed. “Most political office holders from the North are hereby served a notice that they have failed the test to lead the region towards economic recovery and growth,” NGS said. Some of the signatories to the communiqué included Professor Ango Abdullahi (Chairman, ACF Political Committee/Convener, Northern Elders Forum); Ambassador Ibrahim Mai Sule (ACF); Bello Suleiman (CODE Group); Mataimaki Maiyashi, (Arewa Research Development Project); Zannah Boguma (Borno Elders Forum); Nafiu Baba-Ahmed (Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria), and Dr. Ibrahim Yakubu Lame (Northern Union).
