To deal with acid reflux, avoid trigger foods like soda, high-fat beef and anything fried. But keep the apples. They contain pectin, fibres that help absorb stomach acid, according to Dr Wayne Andersen, medical director of Take Shape for Life. Apples also contain malic and tartaric acids, two acids that work to beat back any juices that flow up from your stomach. “Sweet apples are considered alkaline foods that work at a cellular level to restore pH balance and prevent” acid reflux, says Andersen.
