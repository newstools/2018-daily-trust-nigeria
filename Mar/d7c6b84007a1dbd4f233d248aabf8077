Another president, another supermodel booboo. When Naomi Campbell excitedly tweeted the result of a photo op with President Muhammadu Buhari during his Lagos visit, it sparked a Twitter row that's yet to taper off. There have been two conflicting version to explain her presence at Eko Atlantic, a land reclamation facility the president toured. Here is the photo that launched a million tweets.  Between the presidency and Lagos government, it is still not clear whether he was on section or to launch it. The same murkiness trailed how Campbell got there for a handshake and photo op. Twitter exploded in a blitz of name calling, referencing Campbell to former Liberian leader Charless Taylor and the infamous ‘blood diamond” gifts to the supermodel. But it is the presidency’s social media communications guru Tolu Ogunlesi who’s been taking some roasting in the past 24 hours after he referenced Campbell’s one-time visit to late South African leader Nelson Mandela and condemned “misogyny” in the anti-Campbell tweets.  All was fine but twitterati flocked around the words “animals” and “raving mad”. They reminded him how he’d previously taken anti-Goodluck Jonathan stance.  Even Senator Ben Murray Bruce got in on the action.  And it didn’t stop there. More tweeters rode in, keypads blazing.   Ogunlesi responded to the roasting with a scorcher or his.  Which didn’t douse the heat.   Ogunlesi has since apologised and offered explanation for “clearer wording”. Thousands of comments and retweets and deletes, Buhari-Campbell link is yet to fade into the sunset.
