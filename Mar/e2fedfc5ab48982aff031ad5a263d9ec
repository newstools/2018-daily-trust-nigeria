Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State has charged security operatives to instantly kill any kidnapper they nab, those found harbouring them, and anyone caught with rifles in the state. He gave the order yesterday at the palace of the Emir of Anka, Alhaji Attahiru Ahmad, during a condolence visit to the emirate over Wednesday’s killings in Bawar Daji village. “Security operatives should not waste time bringing these criminals to judges. Anyone caught with rifles or harbouring them should be executed. If we have to take guns, we will do  that. We have different roles to play in issues that have to do with security,” he said. According to him nobody is allowed to bear arms, and anyone caught doing so should be killed. He said security operatives should not waste their time taking them to courts, adding that it was a marching order from the president, and himself. He said any traditional ruler caught harbouring criminals or involving himself in negotiations for ransom with kidnappers should be treated as a bandit or kidnapper. Governor Yari hinted on a possible relocation of communities sharing boundaries with forests where criminals are hiding.
