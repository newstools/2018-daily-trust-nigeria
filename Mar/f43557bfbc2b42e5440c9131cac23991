The traditional ruler of Rubochi community in Kuje Area Council, Alhaji Ibrahim Mohammed Pada, has said the peaceful coexistence between farmers and herdmens in his chiefdom is because of the monthly security meeting in his palace. Pada stated this on Tuesday during the second phase of security meeting summoned by the Chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, which had traditional, community leaders and representatives of various security agencies in attendance. He said whenever there was misunderstanding between farmers and herders, he would summon members of his traditional council and Fulani chiefs to resolve the issue amicably. He said the leaders of Fulani in his chiefdom always paid him homage during festivals and that he used such occasions to give them useful advice on the need to continue to tolerate each other. Also speaking, the Chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, said he decided to hold the second phase of the security meeting so that the message would be properly passed across all the nooks and crannies of Rubochi community. Galadima said Kuje Area Council  had the highest number of communities among the six area councils in the FCT, hence it had become necessary to reach out to the farmers and herders and interact with them and address  challenges both of them might be facing.
