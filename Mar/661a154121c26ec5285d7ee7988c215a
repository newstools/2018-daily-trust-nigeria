Up to 2 million people across Plateau and Nasarawa will no longer take ivermectin for river blindness this year after transmission of the disease was declared interrupted. The decision to stop mass drug administration of ivermectin came after over 6,000 people and 18,000 black flies—which transmit river blindness—were tested and found free of the infection. The testing confirmed treatment could be stopped, announced the Atlanta-based Carter Centre, which has been supporting treatment for river blindness for the past 25 years. “River blindness has burdened Nigerians since the days of our ancestors,” said health minister Isaac Adewole. “With the support of The Carter Center and other important partners, we are lifting this burden. What we need to do is complement this good work with careful surveillance to be sure the infection does not reoccur.  In that way we can put river blindness into the dustbin of history.” At least four in 10 cases of river blindness anywhere in the world is in Nigeria. Stopping the mass drug administration programme is a “major achievement”, said Frank Richards, director of Carter Centre’s River Blindness Elimination Programme. “But we must be careful to monitor closely over the next few years to be assured that it does not come back.  This will require continued effort and perseverance,” he warned.
