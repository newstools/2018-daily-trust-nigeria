Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has said the FCT Administration will rehabilitate and upgrade the Ushafa Pottery Centre to a skills acquisition and empowerment centre for women to gift them with entrepreneurship development skills. Bello also said the FCT Administration is committing a total of N96.7 Million to a UNESCO YouthMobile ICT and Mobile Application training project that is designed to inculcate in women and youths employable skills that will make them competitive in the contemporary job market. He said over 1,000 participants drawn from women and youths in the six Area Councils of the FCT will benefit from the training programme. He paid glowing tributes to women for their role towards the realization of the Nigeria’s dream for a new capital. The minister made this declaration while delivering his goodwill message to women of the FCT on the occasion of the International Women’s Day celebration. Bello while acknowledging the pivotal role that women have played in the realisation of the Abuja project, noted that Abuja could not have been what it is today without the contributions of women, which he noted span all aspects including engineering, law, administration, social services. He said, “Indeed, long before the idea of a Federal Capital Territory was conceived, it was a woman named Dr. Ladi Kwali that took Abuja to global reckoning. The hard work, industry and skill of the Abuja woman in pottery, mat-making, agriculture and indeed, the family, are all too well known. “When the clarion call for change in this country was sounded, you were not found wanting. For this reason, the President Buhari’s administration is working assiduously towards giving women a pride of place in all fields of human endeavour and national development.”
