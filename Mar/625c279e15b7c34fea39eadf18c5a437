The Projects Development Institute [PRODA] has said its agro machineries produced at the institute aren’t in the market yet because it has yet to get investors to commercialise them. The PRODA Director General Dr Charles Agulanna disclosed this in an interview after the PRODA Day at the 2018 Technology and Innovation Expo in Abuja. According to Dr Agulanna, there is a still wide gap in Nigeria between the researchers and investing public. “We need to cover that gap. You see in more advanced climes you find out that as soon as you get a patent [for your invention], the investing public will pour monies into it to produce it in commercial quantities,” he said. He said the institute was hoping to get investors who can now produce the products in millions ‘’so that the economy of scale can start to bear on cost.’’ Some of the machines produced by the institute include machine that could be used in cereal, palm oil and fish processing adding that many investment potentials abound in the institution.
