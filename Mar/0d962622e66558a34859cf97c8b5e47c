The Coordinator of the Satellite Town Development Department (STDD), an agency of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Tanko Yamau, has said farmers affected by the relocation of the Gosa Market will be compensated. Yamau said all the economic trees on the lands and owned by farmers were assessed before the land was cleared to make way for traders. He said the farmers could not be compensated before the trees were cleared because the FCTA did not want to deny residents the opportunity to trade in the market on the day of the demolition. “The farmers will count all the trees in their lands as economic trees and will be paid. The payment will come after the clearing, but the record will be there. We don’t want people to be denied the opportunity to trade in the market; that is why we are clearing without paying compensation and by the grace of God compensation will be paid after the clearing,” he said. He said all markets along the roads would be moved to a more befitting place, but added that prior notification would be given to the traders while another place would be earmarked for them. “We have set up a committee to arrange how to move other markets on the roadside. It is not going to be immediate, but a gradual process. We must locate a new site and clear it before moving other markets,” he said.
