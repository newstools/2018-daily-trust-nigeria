In the wake of the release of about 101 abducted school girls in Dapchi, Yobe state, Amnesty International (AI) has insisted the Nigeria authorities investigate the security lapses that caused their abduction.

A statement yesterday by the spokesman of AI in Nigeria, Isa Sanusi quoting the country director Osai Ojigho  also said  the Nigeria authorities must ensure Dapchi schoolgirls’ welfare‎.

Sanusi further qouted Ojigho as saying, “For the abducted girls who have been returned, and their families, this is a day of huge relief.'

“But despite this positive development, four girls from Dapchi are still being held by Boko Haram.

He added that, "Boko Haram must immediately release these girls and all other abductees – including some of the Chibok girls - and end the spate of abductions of civilians which amount to war crimes."

He noted that, “Moreover, the 101 released girls are currently being held in the government’s custody, further prolonging their ordeal.

“The authorities must immediately release them, and ensure that they are able to return to their families or be provided with an alternative safe option if they so-choose.

"The authorities must also ensure the girls have access to comprehensive support, including confidential counselling and medical care.

“Furthermore, it remains absolutely vital that the Nigerian government investigates the security failures that lead to the abduction .

He said this is a fact highlighted by the tragic news that five of the schoolgirls died in captivity. 

He noted that, “The Dapchi abduction must be the catalyst for the government to ensure adequate protection of all schools in northeast Nigeria so that this can never happen again.

“As a first step towards meeting its responsibility of protecting civilians from Boko Haram attacks, the results of the two investigations into the Chibok girls’ abduction in 2014 must be made public," the Amnesty statement said.
