The Director, Legal Aid Council in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Oseni Agbogbaiyemeh, has said the council will commence free legal services to commercial tricycle operators. The director made this known when some tricycle operators under the aegis of Abuja Tricycle Riders Association (ATRA) paid him a courtesy visit on Wednesday. Agbogbaiyemeh said the doors of his office were always open to the members of the association. “We are here to help you ensure that you get justice when the need arises. We are here to assist you,” he said. He however urged them to shun trouble, violence and other forms of illegalities and also desist from giving bribes to any security agencies. “Tell your members to obey traffic rules and observe the traffic signs, this is what normally brings conflict between tricycle operators and security agents. Make sure you have the particulars of your tricycle intact. You don’t have to give bribes to anybody,” he said. He urged them to also address their passengers politely. The chairman of the association, Hassan Haske, who led other executives on the visit, commended the director for his benevolence. He said his members were law abiding, adding that they were looking forward to a partnership with the council whereby members of the association could be enlightened on their rights.
