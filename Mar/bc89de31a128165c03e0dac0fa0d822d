The Joint Health Workers Union (JOHESU) of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) yesterday staged a peaceful protest against certain conditions in the institution. They accused the outgoing Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the hospital, Prof Abdulwaheed Olatinwo of insensitivity to workers’ plight, and announced a plan to commence seven days of warning strike as from tomorrow. Addressing reporters in Ilorin, the University of Ilorin UITH chairman of JOHESU, Comrade Olatunde Oluwawumi, narrated the workers’ ordeal, vowing to shut down the hospital as soon as the union received directive from the parent body. “There is no water in the hospital, no electricity supply. The hospital has obsolete equipment. Instead of purchasing drugs and equipment, the CMD prefers to be building unwanted houses. The CMD is bringing Minister of Health to this hospital on Saturday this week for the commissioning of the irrelevant structures,”  Oluwawumi said. In its reaction, the management said the issues raised would be addressed. The Director of Administration at the hospital, D. S Odaibo, said the management would address the issues when revenue improved.
