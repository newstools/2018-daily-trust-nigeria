The European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES), yesterday, decried low participation of women in electoral process. To this end, the centre commenced a one -week training of desk officers of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on gender mainstreaming with the theme, ‘BRIDGE Training on Gender and Election in Nigeria.’ “BRIDGE” is an acronym for Building Resources in Democracy, Governance and Elections. ECES Project Director, M. David Le Notre, who spoke at the training in Lagos, said there was need for more space for women. “Records show that women demography makes up the largest chunk of voters’ population, but the women in Nigeria constitute only 5.8 per cent of the political space. “In 2015, only six women were appointed into the cabinet while there were seven female senators and six female deputy governors. “Also in 2015, only one female contested for the presidency while four contested for vice presidency, one for governorship and five for deputy governorship. “These are indicative of low participation of women in electoral processes and government,” he said. According to him, the workshop would avail participants the requisite knowledge for effective gender mainstreaming in the Nigerian political space.
