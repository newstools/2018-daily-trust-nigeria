A group, Concerned Nigerian Youths (CNY), at the weekend, endorsed Senator Yusuf Datti Baba Ahmed as a “credible presidential candidate come 2019.” The group, after their meeting in Abuja, said Senator Baba Ahmed stood tall in terms of credibility, unblemished political record and acceptability among the array of people parading themselves for the presidency. National Coordinator of CNY, Sani Danbarno, said they tagged their Abuja meeting: “Save Nigeria”, adding that they resolved to push Senator Baba Ahmed to unveil his agenda for Nigeria. “We are actually calling on him to aspire; what we are saying is that the leadership is in him and based on his antecedents, he has all the credentials to lead Nigeria out of its troubles; he should simply declare that this is his time and we would do the rest of the job, Nigerians are yearning for him,” Danborno said. “After we analysed all presidential aspirants in various political parties, we have come to the conclusion that Senator Datti is the only capable aspirant for the seat; Nigeria needs to be salvaged and he has the knowledge, experience and youthful energy to succeed. “He sponsored many bills while in the senate and empowered his constituents. Above all, the senator has changed the lives of many youths through his endowment in education,” he said.
