A yet-to-be identified disease has killed eight students at Government Science Secondary School, Kurfi, Katsina State. Our reporter gathered that authorities of the boarding school have since weekend closed it down and sent students back home. The closure however did not go down well with the state House of Assembly which said sending the students home could aggravate the situation. The Assembly directed its Committee on Education and Health to thoroughly investigate the matter. The lawmaker representing Kurfi constituency, Kabir Lawal, prompted the Assemblyâ€™s reaction when he drew attention to the outbreak and the deaths. Two other members, Garba Hussaini and Bishir Mamman from Kafur and Dutsin-ma respectively, said similar issues were recorded at their constituencies, which needed to be addressed also.
