The Senate on Tuesday started a fresh move toward reordering the  sequence of elections by reintroducing the Bill to amend the Electoral  Act 2010. The bill, which was presented by Sen. Suleiman Nazif, passed first reading at plenary. Following the resolve of the leadership of Senate and House of  Representatives to harmonise position on the contentious amendment bill,  the House of Representatives re-introduced its version last week. President Muhammadu Buhari withheld assent to the first version of  the bill, which originated from the House of Representatives and was  later passed by both chambers of the National Assembly.
In declining assent to the bill, Buhari said the proposed law would  usurp the constitutional powers of Independent National Electoral  Commission (INEC) to decide on election matters, including fixing dates  and the order they would go. In addition, the President explained that he was complying with  Section 58 of the 1999 Constitution, particularly sub-section 4, by  refusing to sign the bill. Earlier, introduction of the bill had generated controversy, with  some lawmakers alleging that it was targeted at Buhari in the 2019  elections. The matter also went to the Federal High Court, Abuja, which on March  14, asked the National Assembly not to take any further action on the  amendment bill. Justice Ahmed Mohammed made the order while delivering ruling in an  application filed by the Accord Party seeking a preservative order on  the matter. The judge said “all parties in the suit are directed to maintain  status quo pending the determination of the substantive suit between now  and the next adjourned date.” (NAN)
