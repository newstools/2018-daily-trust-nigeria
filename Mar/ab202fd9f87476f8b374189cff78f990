A staff of Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) has been docked by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) for allegedly forging a National Certificate of Education (NCE). The civil servant, Blessing Njoku was charged before an FCT High Court in Maitama, on two-count charge bordering on deceit and forgery in that she sometime in 2015 in Abuja allegedly deceived the Executive Secretary of PTAD that she was a holder of a NCE. Prosecution counsel, Suleiman Abdulkareem told the court that the defendant claimed to have been a student of Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri, between 2006 and 2009, where she claimed to have graduated with a credit grade in Business Education, adding that she forged the schoolâ€™s statement of result to support her claim. The offences were said to be contrary to Sections 25 (1)(a) of the Corrupt Practice and Other Related Offences Act, 2000 and 363 of the Penal Code, to which she pleaded not guilty. Upon an oral application for bail by her counsel, which was not opposed by the prosecution counsel, the trial judge, Justice Sunday Aladetoyinbo admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N500, 000 and one surety in like sum, who must be a senior civil servant residing in the Federal Capital Territory.
