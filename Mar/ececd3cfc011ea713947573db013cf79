North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has hosted a dinner for senior South Korean delegates - the first time officials from Seoul have met the young leader since he took office in 2011. The South Korean president’s office confirmed the meeting shortly after the delegates’ arrival on Monday. The 10-member team is in Pyongyang for talks partly aimed at restarting dialogue between the North and the US. Relations between the Koreas have warmed following last month’s Olympics. In an unprecedented move, the South Korean delegation includes two ministerial-level envoys - intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security adviser Chung Eui-yong. North Korean state radio earlier said the delegation was met at the airport by Ri Son-gwon, North Korea’s reunification chief, who led talks in the weeks before the Winter Olympics.
