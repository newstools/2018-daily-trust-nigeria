The Just Foundation, an NGO of Al-Habibiyyah Islamic Society, on Sunday in Abuja urged adherents of Islam to lead the fight against corruption in the country through advocacy and sensitisation. The foundation’s Executive Director, Imam Fuad Adeyemi, made the call at the inaugural advocacy meeting of the newly launched project of the foundation, “Encouraging Accountability and Transparency Through Faith-Based Intervention” (EAT-FIn). Adeyemi said that the anti-corruption project of the foundation was inaugurated to fashion out holistic and practical ways of tackling corruption in the country. He said that the foundation would be taking its advocacy and sensitisation beyond Abuja to Kaduna, Osun, Kogi, Lagos in its first phase. The Imam decried the high rate of corruption in the country, maintaining that it was the bane of Nigeria’s progress and development. “We as Muslims need to lead the change in the anti-corruption campaign, corruption has been responsible for the poor state of education, healthcare and general infrastructure decay in the country “So, all hands must be on deck to change this narrative,” he said. He said that the foundation would be collaborating with stakeholders such as EFCC, ICPC, schools and religious organisations to stem the tide of corruption and monitor proposed government projects at all levels.
