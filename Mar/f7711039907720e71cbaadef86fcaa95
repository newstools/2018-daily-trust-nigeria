President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday mourned a former president of the Nigerian Bar Association, Chief Idowu Sofola. Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman Femi Adesina, commiserated with the government and people of Ogun State, the Yoruba elders council, family and friends "of the legal luminary whose successful career over the years chronicles the history and shaping of Nigeria’s legal framework. "As the first African to be elected Secretary General of the International Bar Association, the President believes the elder statesman’s lifelong commitment to learning, and yearning for a better life for the weak and vulnerable, distinguished him early as a leader and role model among his peers. "President Buhari commends Chief Sofola’s contribution to national development, especially in community and human services that have seen many get right judgements , while others got inspirations to rise in the legal profession, reaching the peak of their careers as Senior Advocates of Nigeria." The president prayed that God comfort the family of the deceased and grant his soul eternal rest.
