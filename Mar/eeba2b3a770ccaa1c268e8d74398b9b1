The Director General and Chief Executive Officer, Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Mr Anthony Osita Abuloma  has enjoined all manufacturers in Nigeria, particularly those  operating in the southeast zone to quickly embrace the mobile calibration services which enhance the international standards of locally made products. Abuloma said calibration is a process in which SON compares readings of measuring instruments of industrialists against a reference standard, noting that one of the advantages of calibration was to ensure accuracy level of a measuring instrument. “The importance of calibration is very necessary. It is for the benefit of the factories. It will help manufactures to build confidence in their products,” he said. The Director General spoke yesterday at a forum tagged “General Sensitization on: Mobile Calibration Equipment,” organized by SON in collaboration with the Turaki Heritage Limited for manufacturers/industrialists and other stakeholders within the southeast zone in Enugu. The DG was represented by the Director, National Metrology Institute of SON, Engr Obiora E. Manafa.
