The women chapter of the Islamic Development Foundation Abuja (IDFA) is to establish a hospital in Gwagwalada, Abuja. A member of the Board of Trustees (BOT) of the foundation, Malama Halima Sa’eed, told our reporter in Gwagwalada, yesterday, that the construction of the hospital was to help the less privileged and vulnerable ones  to have easy access to medical treatment. She said the hospital would go a long way in promoting, propagating and spreading the values and ideals of Islam towards ensuring peace and harmony in Nigeria and throughout the world. According to her, the formal fund raising/ground breaking ceremony for the establishment of the hospital would come up on Saturday, adding that the donation would first commence with Muslim women across the country. “And the impression I will want to correct is that the hospital will serve both Muslims and Christians and will especially focus on the less privileged and the downtrodden in the society, “ he said.
