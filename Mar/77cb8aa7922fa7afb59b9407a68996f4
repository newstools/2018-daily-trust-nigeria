A first class Yoruba traditional ruler in Osun State, the Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi, has adopted full regalia of an emir and jettisoned his regular Yoruba dress. The monarch also banished some idols and relocated the popular one that has been in the palace since time immemorial to another shrine in the town. In a chat with Daily Trust, the traditional ruler said Iwo was the home of Islamic scholars and that he could be regarded as an emir. The monarch said his decision to adopt the regalia of an emir was to show the whole world that Iwo was an Islamic ancient town and that the turban was part of his paraphernalia of office. “When I was made the Oluwo of Iwo, I was turbaned. It is because Iwo is an Islamic ancient town. Iwo was known as ‘Geri Malami, meaning, the home of scholars. So, this regalia is appropriate for me as the Oluwo. On the reason he banished the idols and relocated the palace idol, Oluwo said the palace was meant for the monarch alone. “As the monarch, I’m superior to the idol and it cannot be competing with me in the palace... There is a mosque in the palace and we can worship the God Almighty in the mosque.”
