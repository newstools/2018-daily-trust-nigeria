The Television cable entertainment service provider, the MultiChoice Africa and ROK, will be launching on April 5, two new channels: ROK 2 and ROK 3 on DStv and GOtv. In a statement made available to journalists in Lagos, the two channels are expected to join ROK (DStv channel 168), which was launched in November 2016, by the Lagos-based film studio renowned for its original TV series and Nollywood movies. The statement noted that ROK 2 and ROK 3 is expected to result in the growth of the studio’s linear TV programming, as it continues to build a pan-African TV audience on one of the continent’s most widely consumed entertainment platforms. “The new TV channels will see a spike in content production, as the company continues to invest in scriptwriting, production and new talent.” The Chief Executive Officer of ROK, Mary Njoku, was also quoted as saying: “Great storytelling is at the core of everything ROK does. We are really delighted to be launching two new TV channels on DStv and GOtv. “What we achieved with ROK has resonated with audiences around the continent, which has allowed us to build on our success and bring even more brilliant Nollywood and Ghanaian stories, direct to our loyal fans on DStv,” she said. General Manager, Sales and Marketing for MultiChoice Nigeria, Martin Mabutho said, “It is such a great pleasure to be launching these two new ROK channels on both our platforms. We have realized that our customers love homegrown stories and watching local talent and adding these two channels speaks to just that.”
