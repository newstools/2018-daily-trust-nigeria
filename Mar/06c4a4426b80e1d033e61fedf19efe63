A plastic production company at Ajao Estate in Isolo, Lagos went up in flames in the early hours of yesterday. The fire incident, it was learnt, started at around 2:00 a.m, in the middle of production by workers of the company. Fire fighters and other emergency officials battled hard to put out the fire which raged for several hours. The fire spread to three warehouses where bundles of finished products and raw materials were stocked. “The fire was huge and being a plastic company, the plastic materials seriously aggravated the situation”, said an emergency responder who spoke with our correspondent. The state Director of Fire Service, Razaq Fadipe, coordinated the fire fighting operation with the support of other emergency response agencies, especially the state Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), the Federal Fire Service, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), among others. No fewer than 20 fire trucks, including those from the state fire service, Federal Fire Service and Julius Berger, were mobilized to put out the inferno. However no life was lost in the incident, as all the workers escaped unhurt. The Fire Director, in a chat with our correspondent said, “we are in control but it is a very serious outbreak of fire. We have plastic and petrochemical products which when they burn, they spill. They will reduce from the solid stage to liquid stage and they are very hard in battling. “Three warehouses being used for finished products and raw materials are involved. I have seven fire trucks working. We don’t know the cause of the fire yet. But we have been able to prevent it from spreading to other warehouses”.
