Benue State and the Development Finance Institution (DFI) had last year signed a pact on the N2billion matching fund to boost the entrepreneurial potentials of citizens in the state. Under the financing model, both parties gave commitment to contribute N1billion each for on lending to mainly businesses that have high employment generating potentials and value addition to local raw materials. Pitan said that the 38 loans beneficiaries were those who met the bank’s pre-disbursement conditions. Saying that the matching fund was capable of developing small and medium scale enterprises in the state, Pitan urged other businesses in the state to take advantage of the unique opportunities offered by the scheme. As part of the moves to ensure effective utilization of the loans, the BoI boss added that a two-week entrepreneurship training would be organised to build the capacity of the beneficiaries. He said, “The partnership with the Benue State Government goes beyond providing loans. As part of the package, all beneficiaries will undergo two weeks entrepreneurship training to help their capacity to manage these businesses successfully.”
