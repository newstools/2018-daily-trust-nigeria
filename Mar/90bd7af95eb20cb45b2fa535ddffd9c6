President Muhammadu Buhari said under his administration, Nigeria is winning the war against corruption. The president said this at the Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday while meeting with a Qatari business delegation led by the former Emir, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani. “As you are aware, Nigeria just exited its worst recession in more than two decades.  We have more than doubled our foreign reserves.  We are winning the war against corruption.  We are developing our infrastructure.  And we are enforcing the rule of law.  As a result of this, we are seeing significant growth in the non-oil sector which is creating thousands of jobs across the country,” Buhari said, according to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity,   Malam Garba Shehu. The president welcomed the rise in foreign private investments in the country owing to the success of his administration’s economic agenda. In his remarks, Sheikh Al-Thani said that the global opinion on Nigeria as an investment destination had been boosted by President Buhari’s strong standing against corruption and adherence to the rule of law. He also expressed his delegation’s interest to invest in Nigeria’s oil, railway, aviation and power sectors.
