Motorists and travellers had a hectic time navigating through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) road in Lagos on Friday as the entire road was nearly shut down owing to traffic gridlock. The gridlock extended to the tollgate plaza at the international wing of the airport up to Ikeja under bridge. The cause of the gridlock was not known even as motorcyclists popularly known as Okada riders took over the road making brisk business. Many air travellers heading to the local terminals of the airport had to resort to bike so as not to miss their flight with the Okada riders charging as much as N500 from international wing to the MMA2. A traffic official said the traffic gridlock was an extension of the snarls experienced during closing hours. Our correspondent observed that there was no sign of broken down vehicles on the entire stretch of the airport road from international wing to the domestic terminals. However, there was chaos on the road as some vehicles belonging to VIPs took over the other side of the lane preventing vehicles going towards the international wing from moving smoothly.
