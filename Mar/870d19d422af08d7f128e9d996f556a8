The erstwhileÂ  member of the House of Representatives, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has resumed work at the House yesterday. Jibrin who was suspended since September 28, 2016 for a period of 181 days was recalled to the House on Tuesday, following an announcement by Speaker Yakubu Dogara that the lawmaker had apologized to the House. The lawmaker, in company of Chief Whip Alhassan Ado Doguwa, stepped into the House chamber some minutes to noon and headed straight to the table where the mace was kept and bowed. Doguwa then took him to Dogara for a handshake before he finally went back to take his seat. A former chairman of the appropriation committee, Jibrin was suspended due to the budget padding allegations he raised against some leaders of the House, including Dogara, his Deputy, Yussuf Lasun Suleimon; Chief Whip, Alhassan Ado Doguwa and Minority Leader, Leo Ogor. He also accused all members of the House of collecting unjustifiable amounts as monthly running costs. Jibrin was later subjected to an internal investigation of the House, and the ethics and privileges committee that investigated the matter recommended him for the suspension. He was also given the condition to apologize for his wrongdoing before he could be re-admitted into the House. He was also barred from holding any position up to the expiration of the current 8th Assembly.
