The Ekiti State government said it has so far demolished over 300 houses in Ado, Ikere, Efon Alaaye, Omuo, Ise, Emure and Ijero in continuation of its urban renewal programme. It also disclosed it has paid about N400 million as compensation to the people affected. In a statement yesterday by the state’s Ministry of Information, the government explained that the exercise was to pave way for the ongoing urban renewal activities by the Governor Ayodele Fayose administration. Quoting the Commissioner for Lands, Housing and Urban Development, Mr Taelolu Otitoju, the statement explained that the relatively high number of houses demolished by the present administration was as a result of the rapid development in the state. Otitoju stressed that the level of development witnessed in the state in the last three and a half years was a confirmation of the determination of Gov Fayose to improve the lot of the people. He said government embarked on the exercise to ease traffic congestion and adhere to the urban policy of a civilized society, especially as it affects Ado Ekiti, the state capital and local government headquarters in the state. The commissioner, however, asserted that government would not compensate owners of demolished houses that were built on waterways and setbacks, noting that “the recalcitrant property owners had treated several notices of contravention with disdain.” He warned property developers in the state against construction without approved building plans, just as he stressed the need for interested developers to know the status of any plot of land before purchase and that the necessary title deed must be obtained from the relevant ministry before commencing construction in order to avoid embarrassment in future.
