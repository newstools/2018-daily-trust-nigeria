The South South Legacy Forum (SSLF) has said the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, remains the vocal person in the South South in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government. Convener of the forum, Comrade Wilfred Frank Ogbotobo, in a statement yesterday, urged politicians, religious and opinion leaders, traditional rulers and the people of the South South to sustain their support to Amaechi to ensure that the special attention being accorded the region in terms of development by the Buhari administration was sustained. “The South South Legacy Forum considers it a great blessing to have leader with such outstanding courage, foresight and conviction as the anchor of the South South in the first progressive national government in Nigeria’s political history. “We are proud that Amaechi has brought his robust experience as the most productive civilian Governor of Rivers State to enrich President Muhammadu Buhari’s desire to fast-track the development of the Niger Delta. “And as this administration gears up to stabilise its commitment in laying an enduring foundation for sustainable development of the region, Niger Deltans must realise the magnitude of the stranglehold of corruption, lawlessness and impunity from which the national psyche is being liberated, and jettison the tendency to demand quick success,” Ogbotobo said. He said the Buhari administration should be given full support as a grace to free the South South from the shackles of poverty, ignorance and underdevelopment.
