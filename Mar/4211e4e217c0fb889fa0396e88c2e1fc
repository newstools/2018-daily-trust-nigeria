The Just Foundation of the Al-Habibiyyah Islamic Society (AIS) has urged Muslims across the country to be practically involved in anti-corruption efforts. It urged Muslims to lead the fight against corruption scourge through advocacy and sensitization. The Executive Director of the foundation Imam Fuad Adeyemi gave the advice yesterday in Abuja at the inaugural advocacy meeting of the newly launched project of the organisation termed “Encouraging Accountability and Transparency Through Faith Based Intervention” (EAT-FIn) in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation. The event was attended by Islamic scholars, academia, NGOs and government officials among others. According to the cleric the anti-corruption project of the foundation was recently inaugurated to fashion out holistic and practical ways of tackling corruption and its consequences in the country. “We would be taking the advocacy and sensitization to other parts of the country aside Abuja, starting with Kaduna, Osun, Kogi and Lagos in its first phase. The high and rising rate of corruption in the country is worrisome and it has been the bane of Nigeria’s progress and development. “We as Muslims need to lead the change in the anti-corruption campaign. Corruption has been responsible for the poor state of education, healthcare and general infrastructure in the country, so all hands must be on deck to change this narrative,” Adeyemi said. He said corruption was not limited to government circles saying even religious organisations were culpable. He said the foundation would be collaborating with all stakeholders including EFCC, ICPC, schools and religious organisations to tackle corruption and monitor proposed government projects at all levels. The Coordinator of EAT-FIn, Hajia Rekiya Momoh-Abaji expressed optimism that the project would go a long way in reducing corruption to the barest minimum in the country.
