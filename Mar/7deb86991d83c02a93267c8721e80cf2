The United States Government has donated 1.6 million bed nets for distribution in Nasarawa State. The insecticide treated bed nets were provided through the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) jointly implemented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The bed nets, valued at $4.5 million will be distributed in all local government areas of the State, said a statement from the US Embassy Abuja. The U. S. Government also provided an additional $1 million for logistics, including transportation of the bed nets, community mobilization, and training of workers on how to distribute the bed nets. These nets and logistics support provided for their distribution are a gift from the American People to the People of Nasarawa State. PMI was to increase access to malaria related health services, scale up access to malaria prevention within every household – especially for the poor, – and for sound and sustainable investment that can bring about great economic returns. “Eliminating malaria in Nasarawa State and throughout Nigeria as a whole is possible if we all work together to achieve that” said Stephen Haykin, USAID/Nigeria Mission Director.
