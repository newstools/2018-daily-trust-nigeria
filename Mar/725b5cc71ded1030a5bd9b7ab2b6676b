Super Falcons striker, Onome Ebi was yesterday unveiled by the Chinese side, Henan Huishang FC, after she agreed to a deal with the club. The three-time African Women’s Championships (AWC) winner is making a grand return after working hard to recover from an injury she sustained in December 2016, at the final game between Cameroon and Nigeria. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ebi managed to play the final minutes of the game with a fractured hand, in which she displayed an exemplary act of patriotism that earned her the respect of all. The injury side-lined the centre back for more than a year. NAN reports that she last laced her boots for FC Minsk in the Belarusian Premier League, prior to that injury. Koye Sowemimo, Head of Sports, the Temple Management Company (TMC), in a statement said that they were proud of Ebi and delighted that she was up and ready to play again. “We are delighted for Ebi, as with every athlete. You can feel the pressure of not competing again when opportunities do not come quickly enough. “But thankfully, Ebi’s mental strength and the support of her team kept her in good spirit and she has been duly rewarded with a new chapter in her football. “We wish her a successful outing in China and all the very best in all that she does,’’ he said.
