The German Chancellor Angela Merkel was Wednesday elected by parliament to her fourth and likely final term at the helm of Europe’s biggest economy. 

Lawmakers voted 364-315 with nine abstentions for Merkel who was then to be formally appointed by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before taking the oath of office. 

Merkel said “I accept the vote”. 

The ceremony marked the end of a painful stretch of post-election paralysis, the deepest crisis of her 12-year career. 

A right-wing populist rise in September elections weakened all mainstream parties and deprived Merkel of a majority, forcing her into another unhappy alliance with the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). 

On Friday Merkel will head to Paris to discuss EU reform plans with French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of a March 22-23 summit, after a six-month stretch in which Berlin was hamstrung on the European and world stage.
