An FCT High Court in Gudu has fixed May 30 for judgment in the case of alleged misappropriation of N1.64 billion state funds filed against former governor of Taraba State, Jolly Nyame. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) charged Nyame on June 22, 2010 on a 21-count charge bordering on misappropriation of funds to the tune of N1.64 billion while in office. Justice Adebukola Banjoko yesterday fixed the date for judgment after both EFCC and Nyame’s counsels adopted their final written addresses. Counsel to Nyame, Olalekan Ojo had told the court that the confessional statement the EFCC relied on was marred by inconsistency and therefore urged the court to discountenance it. He said no witness in the course of the protracted trial testified or brought any evidence to prove that Nyame diverted funds from Taraba Government coffers. However, EFCC counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), urged the court to discountenance the arguments of the defence, saying the prosecution called fourteen relevant witnesses to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that Nyame’s statement reproduced as evidence supported the prosecution in the case.
