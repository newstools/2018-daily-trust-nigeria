The FCT Chapter chairman of Agriculture and Allied Employees Union of Nigeria (AAEUN), Agha Ukpai Agha, has said the federal government is planning to give land to civil servants to encourage them to go into agriculture. Agha who spoke when unveiling the union’s calendar said with efforts of government to diversify the economy, the agricultural proceeds from the civil servants could serve as source of foreign exchange and revenue generation for the government. “We have asked for land in one of the ministries so that civil servants will have something to do outside their normal work and so that we all will contribute to the economic development of this country,” he said. He said members of the union will also teach rural farmers the important ways of cultivating crops. Highlight of the unveiling and launch of the calendar included the presentation of public lectures on importance of agriculture for economic growth of Nigeria and Individual responsibility in combating climate change.
