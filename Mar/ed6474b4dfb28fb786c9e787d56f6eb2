Residents of Dapchi in Yobe State have deserted streets and shut down businesses in anticipation of the return of Leah Sharibu, the only schoolgirl in Boko Haram captivity. Leah is still held captive by Boko Haram insurgents for refusing to denounce her Christian faith after her colleagues have been released on Wednesday last week.

Another resident, Mohammed Dala told Daily Trust on Sunday that the insurgents were sighted at Bumsa village on their way to Dapchi to free the girl under their captivity.
