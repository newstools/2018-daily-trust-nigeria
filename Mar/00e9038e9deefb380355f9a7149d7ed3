He made the remark when he donated relief items to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Benue State at the weekend. Jime, who visited the various camps located in Guma, Logo and Makurdi Local Government Areas respectively, said the gesture was meant to ameliorate the sufferings of the displaced people. He assured the people at the various camps that the Federal Government is concerned about their plight, adding that the state government is working hard in conjunction with the federal government to find permanent solution to the unknown gunmenâ€™s invasion of their communities. Jime, a former member of House of Representative for Guma/Makurdi constituency, who said his community was also affected, urged the displaced families not to despair in the face of the current hardship.
