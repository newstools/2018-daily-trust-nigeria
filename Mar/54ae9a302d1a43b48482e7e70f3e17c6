There was a mild drama at the Senate yesterday when Senator Jeremiah Useni (PDP, Plateau) stood up to second a motion on College of Education, Pankshin in Plateau State. Useni, a retired Army General had stood up to second a motion sponsored by Senator Jonah Jang (PDP, Plateau) on ‘the need to initiate proceedings for the release of certificates and mobilization of graduates of the Federal College of Education, Pankshin, Plateau state in the NYSC.’ Our correspondent reports that when Useni stood up to introduce himself, he said: “I’m General J.T. Useni or Senator J. T. Useni.” His statement was followed by a chorus of ‘Jerry -Boy,’ ‘Jerry-Boy’ by his colleagues (his popular name while in the military). The retired General, who recently clocked 75, said: “If you call me Jerry- Boy, I’m Jerry-Boy and if you call you me Senator Jerry- Boy,yes  I’m.” The Deputy Senate president, Ike Ekweremadu took back the senators to the business of the day when he said, “thank you Senator Useni, formerly known as Jerry- Boy.”
