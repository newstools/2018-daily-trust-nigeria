The chairman of Gwagwalada area council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, has said that a substantial amount of money has already been set aside by the council for procurement of farming inputs in the area. Mustapha, who stated this in an interview yesterday, said the funds would be used to procure assorted seeds, agro chemicals, water pumping machines, sprayers, among other inputs to support the local farmers across the 10 wards of the council. Mustapha who did not disclose how much was budgeted for that purpose, noted that since the rainy season was now approaching, there was the need for the council to support the rural farmers with inputs. He said the Gwagwalada area council, which he said is known as the food basket of the FCT must always give priority to agriculture while reiterating his administration’s commitment to boosting harvest this year. “We saw how farmers  across the council smile last year during the bumper harvest as a result of support they got through the FCT administration which prompted me to plan such plan too so that farmers will smile this year again under my administration,” he said.
