The chairman of Kwali area council, Mr. Jospeh K. Shazin, has said the council cannot afford to pileup ‘scraps’ that are of no use in the area council and so decided to auction them to the public. City News learnt that Shazin has auctioned broken down tractors. Reacting to the development, he said when he assumed office, he discovered that it can no longer maintain some of the property and decided to sell them off after it was reviewed by the council. He said he met four broken tractors on ground. He said the council spent over N1.5 million to refurbish but they have not generated any revenue to the council. “The council cannot continue to pile up scraps that are no useful and the best option is to auction them. And this auction was approved before my assumption of office by the FCT administration. And even when we came we discovered that we can maintain them, but unfortunately, we were unable to maintain them,” he said.
