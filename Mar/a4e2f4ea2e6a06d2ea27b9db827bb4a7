A large crowd of supporters on Thursday turned out to receive President Muhammadu Buhari between Mararaban Jema'am junction to Miango-Wild Life park in Jos where the President commissioned two completed road projects. Daily Trust reports that the large crowd chanting 'Baba oyoyo' led to a hurried commissioning of the road at Mararaban Jama'a junction. Governor Simon Bako Lalong described the Mararaban Jama'a junction as the gateway to Plateau and also renamed the about eight kilometres road between Mararaban Jama'aÂ  to Vom junction as the Muhammadu Buhari Way.
