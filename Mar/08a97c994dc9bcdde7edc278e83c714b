The Consumer Protection Council (CPC) and senior management of online marketing companies have agreed to develop guiding principles for e-commerce in Nigeria. This is part of the outcome of a meeting held in part to commemorate World Consumer Rights Day (WCRD) 2018, themed: “Making the Digital Marketplaces Fairer.” The meeting focused on the current consumer experience in the online shopping marketplace. The particular concern that was the subject of discussion was protecting consumers, as well as protecting legitimate and responsible online marketing companies and their brands. Both CPC and the online marketing companies agreed that only a robust, ethical and well regulated industry can promote consumer confidence and eliminate distrust, prevent fraud and market entry by those who seek to exploit and defraud. Parties also recognise that technological disruption and innovation remain a vital catalyst for economic expansion, commercial penetration and shared prosperity. As such the council and online marketing companies acknowledge that clear and transparent guiding principles, guidance and a regulatory framework are important to growing and sustaining a vibrant e-commerce industry. In recognition, the council and online marketing companies have adopted certain guiding principles with respect to e-commerce.
