The governor of Ebonyi state, Engr. David Umahi on Wednesday threatened to resist persistent arrests of some top government officials by security agencies in the state. "If they come with 500 policemen, we will raise over 5000 men to resist them," he reiterated. Umahi, allegedly suspected the opposition for sponsoring the arrest which he said was targeted at weakening his political structures and ambitions ahead of 2019 elections. He made this known in Abakaliki when he received the new Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of zone 6, Calabar, AIG Tilli Abubakar who was on one working visit to the state. Umahi also condemned the attitude of transferring cases from the state to Abuja. He however threatened to sue Police if such acts persist. "If not my relationship with the IG, I would have taken police to court. How can police be coming to Abuja to harass our people. So you have to send a word to them. We will not entertain it. "Otherwise, we will go to court and try it and then we will see. We will not accept intimidation", he stressed. The Governor also appealed to the AIG to use his good offices to put to an end to the lingering crisis between some parts of Ebonyi state and Cross River state by establishing a boarder command to take care of the crisis in the affected regions. Responding, the Assistant Inspector General of Police, AIG, Tilli Abubakar described governor Umahi as the most police friendly governor in the country and lauded his support towards the police force in the state and the country in general.
