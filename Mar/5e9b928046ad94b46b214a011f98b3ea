A former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Attahiru Jega, has said that Nigerian leaders, through their actions, inactions and statements, discourage the citizens to recognize and be guided by the national core values. He was speaking in Abuja at a leadership summit organized by Citizenship & Leadership Training Centre of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, with the theme, “Upholding the core Nigerian values.” He noted that Nigerian core values, as defined in the constitution, had been essentially ignored with impunity as guides to policy making and implementation. According to him, the national core values, since incorporation into the 1979 constitution, were not taken seriously by the operators of the constitution for compliance. The non-compliance with core national values, he said, had systematically undermined unity, harmony and peaceful co-existence in the country. He lamented that public officials in virtually all states of the federation have continued to assign more rights to so-called indigenes than to citizens with impunity. This contradiction is at the root of most of the causes of instability, conflicts and violence in contemporary Nigeria, he added. He therefore urged the government to invest heavily in the inculcation and upholding of national core values, with focus on nurturing and empowering the drivers of change, especially the youths.
