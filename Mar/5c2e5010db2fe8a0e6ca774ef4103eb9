The Throne Room parish of the Redeem Christian Church of God (RCCG) has donated hand pump borehole, food items, medical facilities, clothes and other relief materials to Katampe II community of the FCT. Donating the borehole and other items to the community, the senior pastor of the church, Pastor Tunde Benjamins-Laniyi said the gesture was part of the church’s outreach where they survey different communities in the FCT and find out the basic amenities missing so that they can provide for them. “It is our culture at Throne Room Parish Transcorp Hilltop to always look out for communities lacking basic amenities in the FCT. We have carried out such gestures in Gishiri, Bwari and other parts of FCT as part of our effort to put smiles on the less privileged,” he added. While responding, the chief of Katampe II, Zakka Baba, said the church reached out to them at the time they lacked water and basic medical facilities. “This is the first time we are witnessing this big donation with even borehole. Indeed the entire community commend this gesture and also call on other well-meaning Nigerians to replicate the gesture to other communities that lack water and other basic materials,” he added.
