Members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) who were appointed into boards of Federal Government agencies and parastatals under the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, have been inaugurated. The ceremony was performed yesterday by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelameh. Those inaugurated include the APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Bolaji Abdullahi (Chairman, governing board of the National Sugar Development Council); the Deputy National Chairman (South), Engr. Segun Oni (Nigeria Export Processing Zone) and the National Organising Secretary, Sen. Osita Izunaso, (National Automotive Design and Development Centre). Abdullahi, who spoke on behalf of the newly inaugurated board chairpersons and members, promised that they would deploy their “political skills” to help agencies and parastatals to navigate political difficulties encountered in the course of delivering their mandates. He ruled out the possibility of taking over the running of Federal Government agencies and parastatals. Abdullahi, who thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for the assignment, said the appointments had brought about a sense of belonging among APC members who worked hard for the party’s victory during the 2015 general elections. He said the calibre of board members was testament to the progressive ideology of the APC. The APC spokesman also dismissed the view by the opposition that the party won the 2015 elections through propaganda, saying the APC remained resolute in its belief that through progressive ideology, it would bring about change in Nigeria.
