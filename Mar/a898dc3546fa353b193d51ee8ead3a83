The Chairman of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Sen. Victor Ndoma-Egba (SAN), has condemned Thursday’s killing of international aid workers and security personnel in Rann, Borno. In a statement in Abuja on Sunday by Mrs Clara Braide, his Special Adviser on Communication, Ndoma-Egba expressed deep concern over the incident, which also had many people injured. “Aid workers put their lives on the line every day to provide emergency assistance to vulnerable women, children and men,” he said. He expressed “deepest condolences” to the families of the victims and urged authorities to ensure that the perpetrators of the crime were brought to justice. “The NDDC and Niger Delta people sympathize with the government and people of Borno, security agencies, United Nations, other development aid agencies, aid workers, international community and the families of victims at this difficult time. “We pray to God to console all Nigerians and grant families, loved ones and colleagues of the victims the fortitude to overcome this very challenging time,” the chairman said. He affirmed that the Federal Government was doing all it could to check the menace of the insurgents. In the attack, soldiers, policemen, aid workers, including medical doctors and other people were killed, and many were wounded. In January, 2017, Rann recorded a major disaster when a Nigerian Air Force jet mistakenly bombed an Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in the community, killing no fewer than 100 people. (NAN)
