Gareth Bale has a Â£113m offer on the table to leave Real Madrid for the Chinese Super League. 

Los Blancos are willing to let the Wales international leave the Bernabeu this summer.

But Bale, a target for Manchester United and Tottenham has no interest in a move to the Far East.

Spanish outlet Diario Gol, who often make outlandish claims, say Florentino Perez is keen to let the winger leave the club.

Bale has suffered another injury-hit season at Los Blancos.

When he has been fit the 28-year-old has impressed, netting 12 goals and providing seven assists in all competitions.

Bale moved in 2013 from Tottenham to Real Madrid and was seen as the natural successor to Cristiano Ronaldo.

The Welshman has enjoyed major success at the Bernabeu winning the Champions League on three occasions.

He also has a La Liga winner's medal from last season.

But Bale's career has been hampered by injuries throughout his time at Real.

And the club are ready to cut their ties with the forward this summer with a Premier League move his ideal scenario.
