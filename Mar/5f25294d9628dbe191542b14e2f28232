About 70 Islamic school owners in Abuja have urged the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) to give them more recognition and support. The schools under the umbrella of the Association of Model Islamic Schools (AMIS) made this appeal when they paid a courtesy visit to the Directors of Education Resource Centre and the Quality Assurance Department on Tuesday. AMIS chairperson, Alhaja Salau Simbiat Olajumoke, during the visit said the school owners want more recognition from the government to bridge the information gap between the two groups. “We want more recognition from the government; we want them to know that AMIS exists. It is not enough to say we are proprietors of schools but we are Islamic faith-based schools and we need to be recognised. “We are always having difficulties in getting information   and we want the government to be aware of our existence,” she said. In his response, Mr. Ayuba Didam, Director Quality Assurance Department of the FCT Education Secretariat commended the group for the visit. “It is part of furtherance of the cooperation that we all desire and we think it is a good one. If we keep going this way, whatever arises will be addressed without any difficulty,” he said.
