The outgoing FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said his ack was politically motivated.

The U.S deputy chief was fired by Attorney-General Jeff Sessions two days to retirement after two decades of service to the bureau.

However, in a statement issued immediately after his termination was announced, McCabe said the decision was political.

He said: “The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicised, public servants are attacked.

“And people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.

“Here is the reality: “I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.

“The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey’s accounts of his discussions with the President.

“The OIG’s focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn.

“The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens”.

His dismissal, just days before he was set to retire, puts his full pension and benefits package in jeopardy and is seen as an inglorious end to a career of almost 22 years with the bureau.
