The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa'ad Abubakar has announced that traditional rulers have resolved to adopt children whose parents were killed by the Boko Haram insurgents in the northeast. He disclosed this at the launching of a book titled " FathÂ  Rabbil Bariyya" a commentary of the book on the Islamic jurisprudence popularly known as "Izziya" by Sheikh (Dr) Mansur Ibrahim Sokoto yesterday. He said that there were over 50,000 orphans at the camps of Internally Displaced Persons across the northeast who should be catered for by well-meaning Nigerians. "These children lost their parents to the insurgents and need to live a descent life in order not to be nuisance in the society. "We deliberated on this during our meeting and resolved that each emirate should adopt at least five orphans and train them in order to be useful to themselves, their societies and the country," he said The monarch who described their situation as pathetic, urged wealthy individuals to emulate a Sokoto-based business tycoon, Alhaji Umarun Kwabo who adopted and is currently training about 200 of the orphans. Sultan Abubakar commended the author of the book, saying it would go a long way in widening the knowledge of Muslims on Islamic jurisprudence. He enjoined scholars to imbibe the habit of publishing books on the true teachings of Islam in order to save Muslims from being misguided by fake scholars. The book reviewer, Sheikh Aminu Daura said the publisher had called on scholars to make the book part of the curriculum in their schools because of its enormous importance. Over 40 million Naira was realised during the seminar with the highest share of N12 million coming from the Sokoto state government. Highlight of the seminar was the presentation of awards to the winners of the just-concluded quiz competition on Sokoto Caliphate literatures organized by the Sultanate Council in collaboration with Centre for Intellectual Services on Sokoto Caliphate.
