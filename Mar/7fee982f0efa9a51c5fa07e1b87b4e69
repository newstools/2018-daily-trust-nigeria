North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has agreed to meet South Korea’s president next month and impose a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office said in a statement. The two leaders will hold talks at Panmunjom on the highly militarised border. North Korea pledged to not use conventional or nuclear weapons against its neighbour, despite frequent threats from Pyongyang, the statement said. “The North side clearly affirmed its commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and said it would have no reason to possess nuclear weapons should the safety of its regime be guaranteed and military threats against North Korea removed,” it added. “The South and the North have agreed to set up a hotline between their leaders to allow close consultations and a reduction of military tension.” Along with President Trump, we are optimistic about continuing a diplomatic process to test the possibility of a peaceful resolution.
