— Presidency Nigeria (@NGRPresident) March 26, 2018 Media aides to the president, claimed that the award was given by the late civil rights activist’s nephew, Isaac Newton-Farris. Quotes were also attributed to the said nephew, urging Nigerians not to vote out Buhari in 2019.  It is not about the person or personality, but it is about the fact. So, I will just counsel Nigerians, I know, I am a visitor it is really not my business, but be careful before you vote this man out of office. – Martin Luther King’s Nephew
