A Kano State High Court has ordered a former Commissioner of Land in the state, Alhaji Farouk Bibi Farouk and two others currently standing trial before it to enter defence on the  April 20, 2018. The decision followed the dismissal of an application of no case submission filed before it by the counsel to the three accused persons, Barrister Akerelu Kehinde, for the first accused person and Barrister A. A. Mu’Allim for the second and third accused persons. When the case came up yesterday for ruling on the no case submission application, the presiding judge, Justice Nasiru Saminu, stroke out the application on the ground that it lacked merit. Justice Saminu adjourned the case to April 20, 2018 for the accused persons to enter defence. Farouk Bibi Farouk, a former permanent secretary in the ministry, Alhaji Mahmud Bello Bari and a former director, Alhaji Ahmad Ibrahim, were arraigned before the court last year. They were accused of criminal conspiracy and breach of trust leading to illegal sale of plots and issuance of fake Certificates of Occupancy, contrary to Sections 95 and 315 of the Penal Code Law.
