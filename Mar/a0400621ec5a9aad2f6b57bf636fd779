President Muhammadu Buhari and ECOWAS President Jean Claude Brou yesterday at the Presidential Villa in Abuja discussed stability of the subregion. Addressing State House reporters later, Brou, who assumed office on Thursday, said issues of common market and common currency were also discussed. He said he was at the Presidential Villa to inform Buhari that he was the new ECOWAS president and thank him for his support to the subregion. He said: “Nigeria is the host country of ECOWAS and the most important country of ECOWAS. So, it’s extremely important that we come and thank President Buhari for the continuous support that Nigeria has provided to ECOWAS and inform him of some of the key issues facing ECOWAS. There are several activities, programmes and challenges and it is an opportunity to really seek President Buhari’s guidance, advise and how best we can advance the agenda of integration in West Africa.” President Muhammadu Buhari at the meeting said ECOWAS must run a leaner and smarter organisation by cutting costs and becoming more efficient to achieve the objectives of the sub-regional body. According to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity Malam Garba Shehu, the president urged member states of the organisation to pay their annual contributions as and when due.
