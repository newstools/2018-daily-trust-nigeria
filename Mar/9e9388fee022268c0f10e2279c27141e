The Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, has said the nation has not been able to develop a political culture due to the disruptive nature of the political process marred by corruption and violence. In an Easter message emailed to Daily Trust yesterday, the bishop pointed out that years of military rule have diminished the appreciation of democracy. He appealed to the political class to abandon the spirit of selfish accumulation and embrace the principles of integrity and genuine service of our country. Bishop Kukah also criticized religious leaders explaining that sadly, they have proved to be as divided as the people they are supposed to lead.
