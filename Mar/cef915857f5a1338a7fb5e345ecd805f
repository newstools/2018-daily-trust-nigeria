The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr Maikanti Baru has said that the corporation will not resume supply of petroleum products to the NNPC depot at Emene, near Enugu, as long as the vandals continue their nefarious activities on oil pipelines. Dr Baru also spoke on the problem of ‘profiteering’ among  fuel  dealers  in the South-east zone, particularly in Enugu and its environs where dealers sell fuel above the official price of N145 per litre, and condemned the attitude of such marketers who make fortunes at the detriment of the average consumer  in the area. The GMD, who spoke during the NNPC Special Day at the on-going 29th Enugu International Trade Fair, said he had earlier held a meeting with Enugu State Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, on how to make the Enugu depot functional, but he explained to him the implication of vandalization of the oil pipelines, one of which is that “if the vandals don’t stop their negative activities on the oil pipelines, there won’t be supply to the area.” The NNPC depot at Emene, Enugu and the sub-depot at Osisioma in Aba, Abia State were established to service the South-East zone, including Benue and Kogi states as well as the South-south zone. But for close to 20 years, the Enugu depot has been moribund owing to the activities of vandals who destroy oil pipelines.
