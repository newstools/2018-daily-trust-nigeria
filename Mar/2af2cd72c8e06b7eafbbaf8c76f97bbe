A father of two missing children, Malam Gambo Suleja, has said he is yet to  find them since they disappeared in April last year. Gambo, who spoke with our reporter yesterday, said the two children are Armayu Gambo, 5, and Fatima, 3. He said his children got missing on Tuesday, April 25, 2017, at Garki old barracks in Suleja. He said he had made frantic efforts to find them but his efforts had not yielded positive results yet. He said he had reported to the relevant security agencies in the area but they have not brought back his children. “In fact, on the very day the children were declared missing, I quickly rushed to A police division where I opened a file but  my children are nowhere to be found up till today, “ he said. Gambo, therefore, appealed to the general public to join him in prayers so that he can still find his two missing children alive. When contacted, the Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), of Niger state, ASP Peter Sunday, told our reporter via telephone that he was not deployed to Niger state at the time the children got missing. He advised the father of the children to write to serve as a reminder for onward action.
