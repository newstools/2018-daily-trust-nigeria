The Kano State chapter of the APC has called on members of the opposition PDP in the state to gauge their utterances. The Deputy Chairman of the APC in the state, Shehu Maigari, said there was no comparison between the APC and the PDP in Kano State and at the national level. Maigari was reacting to a statement credited to the state Chairman of the PDP, Senator Mas’ud El-Jibril Doguwa, who said the APC was scared about the rising profile of the opposition in the state and Nigeria at large. “Let me state categorically that APC, Kano State chapter, and indeed the government in the state, have not seen any profile associated with PDP, Kano chapter, talk less of acknowledging its rising or falling profile,” he said. He said the PDP should focus on solving their age-long internal crisis and allow the ruling party to tackle the challenges facing the country.
