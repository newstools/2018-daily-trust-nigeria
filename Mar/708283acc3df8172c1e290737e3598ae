The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has expressed shock over statement credited to a one-time Minister of Defence, Lieutenant General Theophilus Y. Danjuma to the Nigerian Army saying his statement is a recipe for disaster. MACBAN in a statement signed by its National Secretary, Baba Othman Ngelzarma made available to newsmen in Kaduna on Tuesday said, “Has the general who accused the Nigerian Army of colluding with armed bandits to perpetrate attacks shown any empathy to the hundreds of pastoralists, including women and children that were hacked to death by an ethnic militia from his own state? MACBAN said it views the outburst by the general as not only disgraceful but very unbecoming of a man of his standing. He added, “The organization views the Nigerian Army not only as a patriotic organization but as a distinguished institution that has excelled in resolving conflicts not only within the country, but also in the whole African continent. “MACBAN views the conflicts between pastoralists and farmers as resource based and for the general to advocate insurrection and lawlessness; he should be ashamed of himself and consider himself as an ethnic jingoist. “MACBAN wants the nation to note that the general’s disregarding of the Nigerian Army and undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria is a recipe to disaster.” He called on the Federal Government to investigate the general’s utterances and his antecedents surrounding the conflicts in the Middle Belt capable of plunging the country into chaos. He further called on Nigerian’s to disregard the outburst of the general and continue to live in peace and harmony as brothers keepers.
