The Abuja Metropolitan Management Council AMMC has warned plot owners to develop them or face revocation by the authorities. AMMC coordinator, Umar Shuaibu, handed down the warning over the weekend. He called on owners of abandoned plots to take charge of their assets by developing them or face revocation by the FCTA. “If these plots are being developed there will be no room for any illegal settlement on them. Also, it cost us to clear their lands for them,” he said, while clearing the Airport road of shanties and illegal structure. Shuaibu explained that the exercise was with the aim of giving the capital city a beautiful look from its entrance, adding that foreign bodies coming into the city can also have a positive impression on the nation. “Abuja is meant to be well presented to the world in such a way anyone coming into the city for the very first time will be impressed and that is why today we have decided to clear anything not conducive along the airport road,” he said.
