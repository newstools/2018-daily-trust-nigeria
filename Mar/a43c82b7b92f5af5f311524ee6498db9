Egyptians began voting on Monday in a presidential election that guarantees victory to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Sisi, who appears to see the vote more as a referendum on his rule than a serious democratic contest, has urged Egyptians to vote, hoping a large turnout will give him a mandate to repair the economy. Opposition figures have called for a boycott, while the president’s sole challenger is Moussa Mostafa Moussa, a Sisi supporter widely seen as a dummy candidate. Sisi’s top potential challenger, influential former military chief of staff Sami Anan, was arrested and halted his presidential bid; another serious contender, ex-prime minister Ahmed Shafik, dropped his campaign, apparently under pressure.
