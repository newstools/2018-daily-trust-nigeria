 In an effort to combat the use of mobile phones to spread damaging footage or images, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Interior has launched a Smartphone app to help protect individual privacy. The app named ‘Kolonna Amn’ (“We are all security“) would allow users to make an official complaint if they believe their privacy has been violated. According to the ministry, the sending of malicious images via smartphones is described as “crossing a red line” where offenders could face penalties of up to one year’s imprisonment or a fine of SR500,000 ($133,000). A Lawyer told Arab News that “The anti-cybercrime law defines the violation of the private life of the individual by misuse of mobile phones equipped with a camera or any other similar device. While launching the app on March 13, the ministry said that the ‘Kolonna Amn’ app will make citizens part of an interactive security system.
