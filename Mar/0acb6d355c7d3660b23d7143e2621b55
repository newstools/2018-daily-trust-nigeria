Members of the National Association of Presidents’ NYSC Honours Awardees have protested over their abandonment by the Federal Government. The ex-corps members initiated and implemented community development projects that positively transformed their communities of primary assignments during the one year compulsory service. For this reason they were offered automatic employments and scholarship for postgraduate studies abroad up to PhD. The National President, Suzanne Jegede, said “74 out of 164 awardees all honoured on the same day in September 2015 with others have finished their masters and are currently running PhDs while others have been abandoned.” Speaking to journalists at Unity Fountain during the protest, Jegede,  appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari, to direct the appropriate ministries, departments and agencies to resolve the uncertainties surrounding the funding of masters and PhDs of the other awardees whose scholarship have been approved by the president himself. “Following series of compliants from the abandoned awardees, the chairman, senate committee on Sports and Youth Development, Senator Joseph Obinna Ogba, had directed the Federal Scholarship Board (FSB) to submit a budget draft to the National Assembly to work on, but the director of FSB only worked on the budget of 2010/2011 affected scholars and refused to submit those of 2012, 2013, and 2014 awardees. “We believe that the refusal by the FSB to carry out the President’s mandate and that of the senate is a calculated attempt to thwart the process,” she said.
