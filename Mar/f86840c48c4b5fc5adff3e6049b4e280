The Senate yesterday summoned the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai and the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris over the abduction of Dapchi and Chibok school girls. The invitation followed a motion by Senator Biodun Olujimi (PDP, Ekiti) on the International Womenâ€™s Day; a day set aside to honour the achievements of women and to call attention to their rights. Buratai and Idris are to brief the Senate on the actual situation regarding the kidnap and present clear operational strategies to rescue the remaining Chibok and Dapchi schoolgirls within two weeks. No date has been fixed for the appearance of the security chiefs. Moving the motion, Olujimi said the spate of girl child kidnappings in Nigeria has assumed an alarming dimension.
