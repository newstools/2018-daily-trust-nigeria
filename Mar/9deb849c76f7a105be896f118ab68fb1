The Academic Staff Union of the Polytechnics (ASUP) the Federal Polytechnic Kaura Namoda chapter has alleged that the rector of the institution Engr Abubakar Ahmad Luggard who is now on compulsory leave had diverted funds to the tune of N3bn.   Last January, the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) in the institution held a demonstration over what they described as pitiful infrastructural decay and overt corruption in the institution.  The ASUP chairman in the institution comrade Umar Usman Maikunkele told newsmen in Gusau that the case was reported to the governing council who accepted the petition and forced the entire principal officers of the institution to a compulsory leave.  "Thereafter a panel of investigation was constituted by the Governing Council to investigate into the allegations and after the completion of the investigation the Deputy Rector, Librarian, Registrar and the Bursar was served with letters relieving them of their positions.  He however said the Union was yet to receive officially the full report of the investigation on the rector from the Governing Council which had been communicated to the minister of education in accordance with federal polytechnic Act.  Maikunkele further explained that a petition had been written to the EFCC for further and thorough investigation and the anti- graft agency had on the 5th of March invited the Union for the adoption of the petition at its northwest zonal office, Kaduna.  â€œThe Union want make it categorically clear that Engr Abubakar Ahmad Luggard must refund the looted N3bn to the coffer of the Federal Polytechnic, Kaura Namoda that was misappropriated during his tenure as rector," he added.  However, the Rector of the institution who is now on compulsory leave dismissed the allegations saying that they are baseless and ill motivated.
