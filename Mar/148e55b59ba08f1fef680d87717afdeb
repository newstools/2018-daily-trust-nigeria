A Basic Science and Technology Teacher in a Junior Secondary School in Bwari, Abuja, Mr. John Adikwu, has said the school has invented solar cooker to tackle environmental problems. Adikwu made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigerian (NAN) yesterday in Abuja. He said the project was presented to the public for the first time when the school received invitation to participate in the fourth edition of the Science and Technology Expo (FESTECH 2018) held recently in Abuja. Adikwu said the solar cooker was mainly fabricated from local raw materials sourced in the country, exceptÂ  the imported glass and mirror. He said the solar cooker prototype took the school three months with full participation of Junior Engineers, Technicians and Scientists (JETS) members to build at the cost of N45,000. Adikwu, who is also the Coordinator of JETS in the school, said the project was delayed for some time due to shortage of funds. He called on relevant financial stakeholders to help to commercialise the prototype for mass production and to make the price of the product affordable for low income earners. The teacher appealed to government at all levels to assist secondary schools engaging in Research & Development (R & D) activities to promote indigenous technology. He also urged government to show more political will towards science, technology and innovation to promote R & D in institutions and industries. According to him, the solar cooker uses no fuel, but energy from direct sunlight to heat, cook or pasteurise drinks. Adikwu said many solar cookers currently in use were relatively inexpensive with low-tech devices. He said using the solar cooker would reduce air pollution, slow down deforestation and desertification caused by gathering of firewood for cooking. (NAN)
