Prisoners  Rehabilitation and Welfare Action (PRAWA) has asked the Federal  Government to make the database of all detained Nigerians available to  the public.

Dr.  Uju Agomoh, the Executive Director of the security, justice and  development focused Nongovernmental Organisation made the request while  addressing a Press Conference in Abuja on Thursday.

She  lamented that 19 institutions detain suspects in Nigeria but there was  no statistics of those in the custody of those agencies of government.

"It  is strange that those detained by the Department of State Security,  Police and other security agencies are not known, Dr. Agomoh said. "As a  nation, we need to have the database of those detained". 

She maintaining that "when these figures are made public, it will reduce extra-judicial killings." 

The  PRAWA boss also called for the reduction in the number of Awaiting  Trial Persons (ATP) in the prisons across the country through the  introduction of new reforms in the criminal justice system.

While  expressing dismay with the alarming number of ATP in prison custody,  she said "only countries just coming out of war have such high number of  awaiting trial persons."

According  to figures from the Assistant Controller-General of Prisons in charge  of Planning, Research and Statistics, Suraj Olarinde, 68% of the inmates  in Nigerian prisons are awaiting trial. This, Dr. Uju Agomoh said, is  the worst in Africa.
