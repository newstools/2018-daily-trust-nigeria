The Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology [NILEST] has said it has the capacity to produce about 360million pairs of male and female shoes which can fetch the country about N1.1bn annually. The Directo General of the institute, Dr  Eucharia  Ngozi Oparah disclosed in Abuja yesterday at the ongoing  2018 Technology and Innovation Expo. Dr Oparah said there is a very huge market for leather products in the country because of its size of population. According to her, many Nigerians can still afford to own a minimum of three pairs of shoes and the institute has the capacity to supply the country. She said it sad to note that Nigeria now serve as a dumping ground for both new and second hand shoes and other leather products from other countries. “This has led to the closure of some industries like BATA, Anita Shoes, Perfected Shoes and Lernard Shoes Limited, thus affected the economy of our dear country adversely,” she said. She said there is need for massive campaign to change the attitude of Nigerians towards homemade leather goods. “It will be necessary for government to enforce the ban on second-hand leather products and place high tariffs on imported articles,” she said.
