Congratulations for twenty years of professional and responsible journalism.You broke the jinx in the north and set the pace.From your humble and modest beginning in Maradi house Kaduna, you grew to become a continental brand. You have over the years became the breakfast in the morning and the pillow in the night for millions of your readers.You were the first paper that gave me a cover interview when I was released from prison in 1998.You have become the most reliable source of information for happenings in the Savanna and the Sahel of Nigeria. For two decades, you navigated the land mines of politics, confronting a distressing challenge of having to maintain friendships across the board at the same time upholding professional ethics.Daily Trust,a friend that can warmly shake your hands and painfully sting your skin with equal measure.  One must be careful when praising the Daily Trust because itâ€™s not a friend for  ALL times.Once again congratulations.
