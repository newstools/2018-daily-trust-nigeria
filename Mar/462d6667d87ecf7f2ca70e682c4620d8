Senator David Mark has described as sad and frustrating the unabating killings in parts of Benue State in spite of repeated peace moves between the indigenes and the Fulani herdsmen in the area. A statement by his Media Assistant Paul Mumeh quoted the Senator saying, “Only yesterday, about 26 indigenes of Omusu community in Okpokwu Local Government Area of Benue State were gruesomely murdered in cold blood by assailants believed to be herdsmen.” He said, Senator Mark in a reaction to the incident condemned the unwarranted killings of innocent citizens, pointing out that the crisis is degenerating to something akin to "war without end", defying all peaceful approaches. "I'm aware of various peace initiatives over the incessant clashes resulting to loss of lives and property. That the killings continue unabated is something beyond the ordinary," Mark said. “Let me once again appealed to the assailants to sheathe their swords and allow peace to reign.   Whichever side of the divide and whatever vocation you are engaged in, no progress can be made in a crisis-ridden environment”. Senator Mark bemoaned the degenerating cases of insecurity in the land, saying “from abduction of innocent school girls in Dapchi, numerous cases of kidnapping to outright terrorism against unsuspecting citizens, the situation is frustrating. "We must all make concerted efforts to achieve peace in our communities. Our security agencies should rise up to the challenges and protect lives and property.  Life is sacred and we must not take it for granted”. Senator Mark tasked the apex government to do more in terms of ensuring justice, fairness and peace to all concerned. “This certainly is not part of our culture or way of life. We must all join hands to end this calamity and change the narrative for good”.
