Naomi Osaka and Daria Kasatkina will contest today’s BNP Paribas Open final at Indian Wells after shock semi-final victories over Simona Halep and Venus Williams respectively. Unseeded Osaka, ranked 44 in the world, thrashed lacklustre world number one Halep 6-3 6-0 in 64 minutes. Fellow 20-year-old Kasatkina beat world number eight Williams 4-6 6-4 7-5. It was the Russian’s fourth consecutive victory over a current top-20 player, all of whom have won Grand Slams. “[After a] match like this, you’re just speechless,” she said. “Too many emotions and you cannot explain everything. It’s one of the best nights in my life, for sure.”
