One of the released Dapchi schoolgirls, Fatsuma Abdullahi, has related how five girls died, while in captivity.  Abdullahi who spoke in Hausa, said the five girls had died as a result of the stampede caused while trekking. “Out of the five girls that died, I know only two of them - Aisha and Maimuna.” She added that while with their captors, they were not treated badly. “They gave us food, Infact we cooked the meals ourselves, while we were kept in an enclosed place. And not even an airplane would see us.” Earlier, Daily Trust reported that the insurgents returned the girls in the early hours of Wednesday few minutes after soldiers were withdrawn from the town.
