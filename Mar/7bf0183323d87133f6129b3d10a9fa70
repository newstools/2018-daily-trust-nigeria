More than 14 people were feared killed in attacks on Fulani settlements by suspected Mambilla militia in Sardauna Local Government Area of Taraba State, witnesses say. Daily Trust findings revealed that about 12 others were also wounded and are now on admission at a hospital in Gembu. A victim of the attack, Malam Abubakar Ardo, who escaped with his family, told our reporter in Gembu that the attacks started at about noon on Thursday and most of the killings occurred at night. He said almost all the houses in about 15 Fulani settlements were burnt by the attackers. MalamÂ  Ardo said the timely arrival of soldiers and the police prevented more killings and destruction of property, adding that there was calm, but the Fulani had fled the area. He said five of those killed were buried in Gembu shortly after prayers yesterday. The police spokesman, Taraba Command, ASP David Misal, told our reporter four people were confirmed killed from both sides, and adequate security men were dispatched to the area to restore peace, adding that no arrest had been made.
