The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has cleared a number of ICT security and systems infrastructure upgrade projects of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to stem cyber-attacks against Nigeria’s financial sector. NITDA had recently alerted the country on potential cyber-attacks likely to be experienced, targeting banking, health, power, transportation systems, as well as other critical national infrastructure. But the CBN, in its efforts towards mitigating these threats, especially in the country’s financial institutions, initiated the implementation of the projects. The CBN projects cleared, according to the Director General of NITDA, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, include, Enterprise Network Security - Gateway Security Project, aimed at upgrading the Bank’s network security appliances and ensures that network security appliances are highly available and provide comprehensive real-time protection against advanced threats; the Intelligence Security Operations Center project that is aimed at providing a dedicated center, technology and team for continuous monitoring of the Bank’s network to prevent, detect and deal with Cyber-attacks. Others, according to Dr Pantami in a statement yesterday are; Implementation of a Network Access Control (NAC) Solution - a security approach designed to restrict the availability of network resources to endpoint devices - aimed at enhancing infrastructure security as well as limit potential effects from emerging security threats, and the Identity and Access Management Solution project aimed at ensuring that the right individuals access the right resources/applications at the right times and for the right reasons. The Director General, in his clearance letter, commended the Bank for the proactive manner it handled these threats and reiterated NITDA’s continued support.
