About 11 billion shillings (109 million dollats) is missing in Kenya’s health ministry, the nation's auditor-general has revealed. This is a disclosure that will increase disquiet among international-donors who spend hundreds of millions on development-programmes. Corruption in East Africa’s richest economy is a major concern for investors. Kenya ranked 143 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index. The revelations came from Auditor General Edward Ouko’s latest report, covering the 2015/16 (July-June) fiscal year, published on the organisation’s website. The report documented discrepancies in other government departments, alleging that several failed to provide supporting documents for expenditures totalling 40 billion shillings. Kenya’s budget is 2.6 trillion shillings this fiscal year. Health Minister Sicily Kariuki said the issue in her ministry was an accounting matter and that the finance department would respond to the auditor general. “The team assures me there is no money lost. It’s a matter of documentation going back to 2012/13,” she told the Media. The missing cash had been held at some departments that were merged in 2013, but did not move into the new department’s accounts, the auditor general said in the report. The U.S. suspended 21 million dollars in direct aid to the health ministry last year over corruption concerns.
