Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) marginalize all parts of Nigeria in their recruitments. Speaking to journalists at the sideline of a National Stakeholders Seminar on federal character held in Abuja, the Acting Executive Chairman of the Federal Character Commission (FCC), Dr. Shettima Bukar Abba, said his commission had uncovered lopsidedness in some MDAs depending on where they were sited. On lopsidedness and marginalisation in recruitments, Dr. Abba said some Nigerians hold erroneous impression on the issue. “I said erroneous because from the statistics we have over the years, there is no state in this country that is not represented and also there is no state in this country that is not marginalised in certain aspect, depending on where the MDA is situated,” he said. The FCC boss said there was need for all MDAs to respect the federal character principle in recruitments as that fostered national unity. Speaking on compliance with the federal character principle by federal and state MDAs, a professor of media and society, Professor Umaru Pate, said government agencies are rampantly abusing and failing in complying with the federal character principle.
