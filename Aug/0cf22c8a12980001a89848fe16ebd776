A former deputy national chairman of the People’s Democratic Party, Olabode George, yesterday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to convene an emergency meeting of elders to address killings across the nation. Addressing journalists in Lagos, he asked all stakeholders to see the current challenge as a collective problem requiring concerted efforts. He said: “I thank God Almighty; I am in my mid 70’s and I have never seen things happening this way, you don’t know who is next, the killing of even one Nigerian should bother all of us. This is not the time for partisan politics, this is a serious national security matter. I suggest that the President should call a meeting of all the elders in all the corners of this country to talk as a Nigerian family and there should be no press coverage, let them shut the door. “This nation must survive. I am not partisan now. We need a government that would harness the resources of this nation for the betterment of the country. We need good housing, employment for graduates. Let’s fear God and allow the corporate resources to serve the need of the people”. He said those who recently defected from the ruling All Progressive Congress to the PDP only returned to the party where they were landlords George said the APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, was shooting in a wrong direction and appeared as someone in a panicky situation. He, however, asked the PDP leadership to manage the re-entry of the defectors wisely so that the current leaders would not feel shortchanged.
