President Muhammadu Buhari has been elected as the Chairman of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Buhari’s election was one of the highpoints of the 53rd Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS which held in Lome, Togo. Buhari took over from the Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe, who was chairman from June 2017 to yesterday.  The Togolese president took over from the former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Buhari, according to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu commended his colleagues for his election saying he did not offer himself for the post, “but you refused to take my no for an answer.” He, however, told his colleagues that, “I am truly humbled and pledge to serve and work with all of you to deliver on peace, security, good governance and socio-economic development” of the sub-region, and “take our organisation to greater heights.” Buhari also commended his immediate predecessor, President Gnassingbe for successfully hosting two important meetings of the Joint Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and ECOWAS, as well as the 53rd Ordinary Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS. He was presented with the Emblem of ECOWAS by the outgoing chairman, while the next meeting of the organisation would take place in Abuja on December 21, 2018.
