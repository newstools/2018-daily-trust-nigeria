"People who were at the factory told us that the bubble burst when they heard agonizing cry of Toyin's victim repeatedly and decided to check up what had happened. It was then they allegedly met Toyin dumping the corpse of his victim into the freshly dug hole, apprehended him and later handed him over to the nearest police station in the area.  The police had since morning arrested Toyin with the corpse and taken them away to their station. "  He added that the deceased's wife is heavily pregnant and reported at the station when informed about the tragedy that befell her husband.
