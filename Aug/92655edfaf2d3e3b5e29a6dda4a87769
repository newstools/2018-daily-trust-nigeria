Akwa Ibom State Deputy Governor Moses Ekpo yesterday denied resigning and quitting the People’s Democratic Party. This is amidst reports that a former governor of the state and Senate Minority Leader, Godswill Akpabio, is set to dump the PDP for the All Progressives Congress. He asked the people of the state to remain resolute in their support for Governor Udom Emmanuel and the PDP in order to move the state forward. “I have not resigned. I have no reason whatsoever to resign or jump ship from a government that is both responsive and performing optimally, while giving practical meaning to democratic dividends for the people of Akwa Ibom.  I cannot, and will not jump ship,” he stated. Also in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ekikere Umoh, the deputy governor dismissed online reports that he had resigned his position and left the PDP. “The attention of the Office of the Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State has been drawn to certain rumours and misrepresentations in a section of the media to the effect that the Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Moses F. Ekpo, MFR, has resigned from office. “The reports particularly from the online community further make allusions to the effect that the Deputy Governor has also defected from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. “There is no iota of truth in the story making the rounds. The purported report is therefore nothing but a poorly concocted piece of a malicious hatchet job and a pack of lies, and should be appropriately ignored. “Currently, His Excellency, the Deputy Governor is representing the State Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel as Special Guest of Honour at the 2018 International Convention of Ati Annang holding in New York, United States of America, and is yet to return to the state,” the statement read.
