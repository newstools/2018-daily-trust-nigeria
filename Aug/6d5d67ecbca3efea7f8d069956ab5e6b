The Arewa Consultative Forum has called on Nigerians to avoid hate speeches as the nation joins other Muslims across the world to celebrate sallah. ACF, in a sallah message signed by its national publicity secretary, Muhammad Ibrahim Biu, extended its felicitations and good wishes to the Muslim Ummah and other Nigerians. “The Forum urges all Nigerians to be patient with one another, with the government and continue to have hope as our current security and socioeconomic economic challenges are not insurmountable,” the statement read. The forum appealed  to governments at all levels to put in measures to ensure security of lives and property. It also called for policies  and programs that would boost the economy and reduce the economic hardship. It also asked all illegible voters to register and collect their Permanent Voters Card “as the only weapon they can use to exercise their civic responsibility during the 2019 general elections and hold the elected leaders accountable. “Furthermore, we urge Nigerians to avoid violent acts during and after elections, as they only destroy our democratic process and peaceful coexistence as well as make meaningful socioeconomic impossible. “In the same vein, ACF appeals to the youths to avail themselves to opportunities offered by government and add value to themselves and to the communities rather than take to violent acts that comes with poverty, unemployment and frustrations.”
