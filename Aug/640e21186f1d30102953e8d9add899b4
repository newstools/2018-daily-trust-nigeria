The last set of Muslim pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia for the 2018 Hajj exercise through the Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board left yesterday. With yesterday’s flight, the seventh and the last for this year’s exercise, a total of 2000 pilgrims had so far been airlifted to Saudi Arabia. According to the Commissioner for Home Affairs and Amir-ul-Hajj Lagos State, Dr Abdul Hakeem Abdullateef, the last flight catered for 98 pilgrims and officials of contingent from the state. The Lagos State governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, advised officials of the Board to handle their pilgrims with the highest level of moral attitude and discipline in order to achieve the best results in this year’s hajj operation. Speaking through Dr Abdullateef, the governor enjoined the officials to translate the training they gained through the Lagos State into proper handling, managing and supervision of the pilgrims so that the appreciable standard already set can be sustained. He advised the intending pilgrims to play by the rules set by the State Board, the Saudi Arabian government and other stakeholders to avoid any act that might cause embarrassment or criminal charges. Mr Ambode also appealed to the pilgrims to be patient, tolerant and exhibit a high level of endurance in the cause of performing their Hajj rites.
