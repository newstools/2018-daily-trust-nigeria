Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, yesterday flagged off the rehabilitation of township roads in Oro, Kwara State, a statement by his assistant Segun Adeyemi said. The project according to the statement was awarded by the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, and was initiated by the minister. He said the project is a dividend of democracy to the people of Oro and an attestation to President Muhammadu Buhari’s commitment to infrastructural development and better life for Nigerians. “We came this morning to inaugurate the rehabilitation of Oro township roads. When we said the contract had been awarded, some people were in doubt. We thank God that we are witnessing its inauguration today,” Alhaji Mohammed said. He appealed to the people of the community, particularly the youth, to give the contractor the chance to deliver the project on time. “We want to appeal to you that no one should exploit the contractor by asking for money before working,” the minister said. He also called on the contractor to engage members of the community in the rehabilitation project, as well as to give priority to them in the supply of work materials. The Project Manager, Mr Niyi Afolabi, said the project would involve drainage, construction of bridges and asphalting. “We are commencing work today. We have been given six months to complete the project but we want to assure you that we shall deliver in four months,” he said. The Asanlu of Oro, Chief Simon Olayemi, who spoke on behalf of the community, expressed appreciation to the federal government for the project and to the minister for facilitating it. The statement also noted that the project covers the rehabilitation of Eid Praying Ground, (NITEL) Tee Junction up to Luke Mansion Junction and the construction of Adeboye Avenue Road.
