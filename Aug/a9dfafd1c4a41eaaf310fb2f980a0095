A Grade 1 Area Court, Kado in Abuja, yesterday sentenced a scavenger to six months’ imprisonment for mischief and theft of engine parts valued at N75, 000. The judge, Alhaji Ahmed Ado, who handed down the verdict, however, gave the convict, 28-year-old Kabiru Yunusa, an option of N6,000 fine and warned him to desist from committing crime. He said the punishment meted out on the convict would serve as deterrent to others. The convict, who had pleaded guilty to the charges, urged the court to temper justice with mercy, saying the hard times were responsible for the crime he committed. Earlier, police prosecutor Judith Obatomi told the court that the complainant, Etim Esong, of Mopol Quarters, Nyanya, Abuja, reported the case at Utako Police Station on Aug. 6. Obatomi said the accused was caught vandalising the complainant’s high capacity bus engine valued at N75,000 and stole some engine parts. “The accused was caught in the act and the items were recovered from him,” he said. The offence contravened sections 288 and 327 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
