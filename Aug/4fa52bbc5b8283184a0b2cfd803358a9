The president of a grade C customary court at Mapo, Ibadan, Chief Odunade Ademola, has dissolved the 23-year-old marriage of a commercial motorcycle operator, Nurudeen Adeoye, to his wife, Iyabo, over threat to his life. Adeoye had prayed for a formal separation from Iyabo. He said, “I want this court to dissolve our marriage. Her trouble made us move from one house to another before she left my house five years ago to marry another man. She used to harass and embarrass me. I want this court to save my life.” Iyabo was not in court to defend herself on the allegations Adeoye levelled against her. Chief Odunade held that the fact defendant had left the plaintiff five years ago indicated there was no more love between them and dissolved the marriage.
