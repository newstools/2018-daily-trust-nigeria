The Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brig-Gen. Zakari Kazaure, says it is now an offence for corps member to travel out of their camps or places of primary assignments without obtaining permission. Kazaure stated this at the Ekiti State Permanent Orientation Camp, situated at Ise/Emure in Ise/Orun Local Government Area of Ekiti State during a shuttle visit to educate corps members on health and security matters. He said the rule of the corps was being ignored in a manner that suggested that authorities had abdicated their roles of  looking after the wellbeing of corps members. He noted that rules banning corps members from unauthorised journeys were more implementable when they were on orientation camps than while in places of primary assignment where they were treated as independent adults. He said: “You all have to avoid night journeys and other unnecessary journeys for that matter. Remember that before you embark on any journey, the need arises that you first inform your immediate supervisors and obtain necessary permits. “A graduate is expected by the society to be above board. I therefore want you to please join hands with me to ensure that the tragic incident in Taraba is the very last of such,” he said. Kazaure expressed deep regrets over the drowning of nine corps members in a river in Taraba State on Sunday, describing it as a huge loss to him personally and the nation in general. He asked corps members to respect the cultures and traditions of their host communities. Kazaure said in cases of any emergency, corps members were free to call him on his personal number: 07042542779. He also female corps members in particular against indecent dressing.
