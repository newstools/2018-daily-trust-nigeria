Two key leaders of the Anglican and Presbyterian Churches have called on the federal government to strengthen all political institutions as a way of deepening democracy in the country. Both leaders spoke at different events organised by their churches, emphasising that if the government works on making institutions stronger it would be difficult for corruption or such crimes to thrive as they are presently. They also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to focus on making the people benefit more so that there would be no excuses for mounting crimes and agitations. While both called on Nigerians to pray fervently for wellbeing and survival of the country, Most Reverend Tunde Adeleye, head of the Calabar Diocese of the Anglican Church who spoke when his church had is year’s synod, advocated for part time legislature, state controlling their own resources, the need for local government and state police system. According to him, when politics is made less attractive, the craze for political offices and crime associated with it would reduce. “Nigerians should pray more than before. Prayer changes things. Prayer can deliver us from is grip of suffering we are going through now. The hearts of the kings are in God’s hands”, he said. Also, the prelate/moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria, Rev. Nzie Nsi Eke speaking during the celebration of the 172 anniversary of the church in Calabar berated the increasing killing of Nigerians.
