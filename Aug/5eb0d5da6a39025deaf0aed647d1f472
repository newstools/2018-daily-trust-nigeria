 About 800 people defied early morning rains in Lagos on Saturday to participate in a walk to create awareness and raise funds to feed the poor in indigent communities. The walkathon was organised by Lagos Food Bank Initiative (LFBI), an NGO, to meet increasing food demands of communities in Lagos State. The walkathon took off at 10.30 a.m. from Victory Grammar School, Maryland, through Isaac John Street, Ikeja and back. Mr Enoch Alonge, Spokesman for LFBI, said, “We are exposing hunger so that those who have to eat can know there are those who can’t afford food. “Since we started two years ago, we have helped in providing over 500,000 meals. “Usually, we run a monthly outreach where we visit indigent communities; people in dire need of basic supplies, which are mostly food and health-related,’’ Alonge said. Also, Mr Michael Sunbola, President of the organisation, said besides its visits to communities, LFBI also hosted a mobile pantry from its office in Agege. He added that some of the communities visited included Ago-Egun, Ajegunle, Agege, Oworonshoki and Mushin. “We host a mobile pantry, where we go round different places, especially where there are destitute to give meals. “We do this weekly, going to under bridges and bus-stops, where the indigent dwell,’’ Sunbola said. Mr Taiwo Popoola, LFBI Head of Children Unit, said, “We have a list of communities we are yet to visit; we hope to help more of them get access to food and healthcare. “Usually, we get support and raise funds through the social media but we want to reach out to more donors who don’t engage with us on social media,’’ he said. Popoola urged individuals, public and private organisations to donate towards enabling the LFBI to realise its objectives.
