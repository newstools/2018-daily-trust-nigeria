He said that he had met with the Executive Secretary, National Universities Commission (NUC), Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, who had allowed the school to be affiliated with the Federal University of Technology (FUTO), Owerri. He added that the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC) had been developing the curriculum for the institution as a prerequisite for the upgrading. “We have come for a formal discussion with the ministry in respect of FRSC academy in Udi, Enugu state and its training school in Jos. “We are not asking for funding, but for the upgrading of the schools to a degree awarding institutions, and we believe with the support of the minister, we can achieve this.’’ Responding, the minister assured the management of FRSC of his support and assistance towards the realisation of their demand.
