A Borno gubernatorial aspirant under the Labour Party, Captain Ibrahim Mshelia, has commiserated with the people of Borno State over the damage of one end of the Biryel Long Bridge in Bayo Local Government of the state. He also appealed to the Federal and State governments to swiftly attend to the damaged bridge which hitherto was the only motorable link between Southern Borno with other parts of Borno and Gombe States, saying the collapse of the road will inflict more hardship on the people. However, Mshelia, a foremost airline pilot in a statement made available to our correspondent on Sunday expressed joy that no lives were lost when the bridge collapsed. He, however, called for calm and patience stating that those infrastructural deficits will be strategically handled, lamenting that certain parts of the state have been suffering economic hardships for nearly 20 years as a result of dilapidated roads and other infrastructural deficits and neglect. He assured that there will be investment in infrastructure and people-oriented programmes once the people look beyond party and vote right for those determined to get the state working again. He said: "My heart goes out to the people of Borno State, particularly the areas whose movement and economic activities are now affected as a result of the damage to the Biryel Long Bridge in Bayo Local Government due to the heavy down pour resulting in the flood yesterday which damaged the bridge. "We understand the hardship it is going to cost especially for those who have to traverse between those points to meet up their daily economic and social needs. That is why we are calling on the Federal Government of our able President Buhari and indeed the Governor of the state, Kashim Shettima to rush to the scene and fix the link bridge without further delay so as to forestall further hardship to the people."
