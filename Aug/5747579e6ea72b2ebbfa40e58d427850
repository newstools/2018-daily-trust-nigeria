A nine-year-old boy has committed suicide allegedly because his classmates refused to accept him after he has confessed to being a homosexual. According to Yahoo Lifestyle, his distraught mother said the young boy had also told his mom the same news weeks before, and she did not seem to mind. However, it proved to be too big a news for his peers to comprehend, the mother was quoted as saying. “He looked so scared when he told me. He was like, ‘Mom I’m gay,’” his mother, said Leia Pierce, who lives in Denver, Colorado. “And I thought he was playing, so I looked back because I was driving, and he was all curled up, so scared. And I said, ‘I still love you.’” Hoping to get the same support from his peers, Jamel Myles, who had just started fourth grade on Monday last week, went to school and ready to declare his sexual orientation. “He was gonna tell people he’s gay because he’s proud of himself,” his mom said. Unfortunately, his classmates were not as accepting as his mother, and his confession reportedly led to bullying, which eventually led to his suicide, reports said. Pierce found her son dead in their home last Thursday and points to bullying as the cause. “Four days is all it took at school. I could just imagine what they said to him,” Pierce said. “My son told my oldest daughter the kids at school told him to kill himself. I’m just sad he didn’t come to me.” Jamel was clearly going through a very monumental transition. Not only was he going back to school with a major admission, he was also adjusting to his newfound femininity. “I know you buy me boy stuff because I’m a boy, but I’d rather dress like a girl,” Jamel recently told with his mom. “I’m so upset that he thought that was his option,” Jamel’s mum said.
