German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said “vigilante justice” will not be tolerated after far-right unrest over a murder in the eastern city of Chemnitz. Scuffles have broken out during two days of protests by hundreds of people in the city centre since a German was stabbed to death early on Sunday. A Syrian man and an Iraqi man have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police were still out in strength on Monday evening, braced for new demonstrations by both right and left.
