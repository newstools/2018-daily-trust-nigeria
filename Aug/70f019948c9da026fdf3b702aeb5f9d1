The FCT Police Command has assured residents of Abuja and environs that measures have been put in place to ensure an incident-free Eid-el-Kabir celebration. FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, while parading suspects arrested over various crimes at the command’s headquarters yesterday, said the command’s onslaught against criminal elements in the city would be a continuous exercise until they were flushed out. “The command has made adequate security arrangements that will cover Eid praying grounds and recreational centres during the forthcoming Eid-el- Kabir celebrations,” he said, adding that the command had intensified police presence and patrol. “As part of determination by the command to strengthen its relationship with members of the public, suggestion boxes have been strategically placed at the Berger Roundabout, Area 1 Roundabout and the Federal Secretariat to receive suggestions, observations and complaints from the public. “Members of the public with observations or complaints can also relay same to the CP FCT Monitoring and Mentoring Unit (MMU) on cpfctmonitoring@gmail.com or call and send text messages to 07064328222 and 08123608058,” he said. CP Ciroma added that the initiative was part of effort to get feedback from the public about activities of the command and how it could be improved upon.
