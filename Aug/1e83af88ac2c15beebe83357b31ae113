The number of people killed in Zimbabwe's post-election violence has risen to six, according to police, as opposition leader Nelson Chamisa claimed victory before the release of official results in the tightly contested presidential poll. The situation in the capital, Harare, remained tense on Thursday, as police raised the death toll in clashes between security forces and opposition supporters from three to six. The electoral commission has until Saturday to release the full results of the presidential elections, but faces pressure to make them public as soon as possible amid escalating tensions. It is expected to start releasing later on Thursday. On Wednesday, after electoral officials announced that the ruling ZANU-PF party won most of the parliamentary vote, opposition supporters who claim Monday's poll was rigged took to the streets, burning tyres and throwing stones before riot police and the army intervened. Both the government and the opposition accused each other of instigating the violence. Meanwhile, Emmerson Mnangagwa, incumbent president and ZANU-PF's leader, said on Thursday he was in talks with the opposition to find ways to defuse the situation.
