The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) yesterday said its attack planes destroyed the hide-outs of bandits in Shamshale and Rugu forest in Zamfara State. The Air Force ‘Operation Diran Mikiya’ comprises the Air Task Force (ATF) component of ongoing ‘Operation Sharan Daji’ in the North West part of the country to tackle banditry. Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, in a statement, said the Air Operation on 15 and 18 August 2018, degraded several identified hideouts of the bandits. He said the attacks, which were executed in support of ground troops in Sector two of Operation Sharan Daji were planned based on credible intelligence that the armed bandits were using an abandoned primary school in Shamashale. He said the bandits were also using some makeshift settlements in nearby Rugu forest in the Eastern part of Zamfara as bases for their operations. “The ATF dispatched two combat helicopters to attack the location. During the attack, some bandits carrying sophisticated high calibre weapons were seen trying to flee the area. “Some were on motorcycles carrying AK-47 rifles and, rather than dropping their weapons and surrendering, attempted to shoot at the helicopters; hence they were neutralized,” he said. He said Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) conducted on 16 August 2018 confirmed that the hideout had been severely degraded. He said, “Items recovered from the armed bandits include two General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), two AK 47 rifles, 100 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition and two mobile phones.” Daramola said the ATF will continue to dominate the area through armed reconnaissance and air interdiction missions to completely decimate the armed bandits in order to ensure a return to normalcy in Zamfara and other States in the North West.
