The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to order the unfreezing of the official accounts of Akwa-Ibom and Benue State governments "illegally blocked" by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The party argued that the feezing of the accounts was a direct attack on innocent Nigerians in those states. "The PDP condemns the freezing as illegal, unconstitutional, overtly wicked and cannot be justified under any guise within the clear dictates and contemplation of our laws and practice as a nation. "The PDP rejects the action of the Federal Government and counsels the Buhari Presidency not to hide under the EFCC to unleash punishment and hardship on the people in states perceived to be averse to his 2019 re-election bid. "In illegally blocking the flow of funds to these states, the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government has ostensibly commenced a reprehensible design of using economic deprivation as a political tool to arm-twist governors and states to support President Buhariâ€™s re-election in 2019. "The APC has been seeking ways to subjugate Nigerians, for which it has now resorted to subjecting millions of compatriots already impoverished by the misrule of the Buhari administration, to face more hardship by seizing funds legally belonging to them. "The PDP therefore urges all Nigerians to stand up and resist this dangerous trend introduced by the desperate APC to subjugate Nigerians, for which Akwa-Ibom and Benue states are now being used to test the will of the people in this direction," the PDP said.
