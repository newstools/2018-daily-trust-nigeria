The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, would have suffered defeat if the Bauchi South Senatorial District by-election was for general elections to elect members of the National Assembly. Bauchi South Chairman of the APC, Murtala Dan Maliki, said this while speaking on the outcome of the recently concluded by-election. Dan Maliki, who said Dogara had lost touch with his constituency with the outcome of the election as the APC won in Dass and Tafawa Balewa, two of the three local government areas represented by Dogara. The APC chieftain, who is also from Tafawa Balewa, said though Dogara had not officially announced his defection to the PDP, he allegedly worked for the party in the by-election. “He was in Bogoro for the election and the PDP won there. The APC won in the other two local governments in his constituency. If he is still with the APC, the party would have won in Bogoro. “In fact, not only in Bogoro, even in Tafawa Balewa, the PDP won in places dominated by his loyalists. “However, what I believe is thatý he has left the APC, but people in his constituency are still with the party and they will vote for it anytime, and I want ýto tell you that if it were general elections and he stands against the APC, he will be defeated,” he said.
