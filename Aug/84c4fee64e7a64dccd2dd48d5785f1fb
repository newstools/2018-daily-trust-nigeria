The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it cannot extended the ongoing Continues Voters Registration (CVR) beyond August 17. According to the body, there won't be time to consolidate the data captured and print out the Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs) if the CVR was extended. The INEC National Commissioner, AVM Ahmad Tijjani Mu’azu (rtd), stated this on Tuesday in Gombe at the opening of training on Registration Areas and Enumeration Area Demarcation (EAD) project, for INEC field officers in north-east geo-political zone. Mu’azu told newsmen that extending the duration of the CVR will affect the process of printing and issuance of the PVCs, which he feared will disfranchise eligible voters that have already registered. “The process of consolidation and printing of the cards would take 90 days, therefore if we increase it from August 17 by one day, we would infringe on the time that is required for printing and may end up not printing the cards on good time for collection by eligible voters,” he said.
