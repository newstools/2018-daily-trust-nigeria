About 22,000 people were rescued from the flood-hit Indian state of Kerala on Sunday, officials say, after monsoon rains finally eased. Military teams as well as disaster response forces and local fishermen reached some of the worst-hit areas. Helicopters also brought much-needed supplies to communities cut off by two weeks of incessant rain. More than 370 people have been killed, most of them in landslides, since the monsoon started in June. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the number of people taking refuge in the 5,645 relief camps now stood at 725,000.
