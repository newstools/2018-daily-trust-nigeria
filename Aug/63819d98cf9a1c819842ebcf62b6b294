As Muslim faithful celebrate Eid-el-Kabir, the Kaduna State command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has deployed over 3,000 personnel in the state to tackle security issues during the festive period. The state commandant of the corps, Modu Bunu in a statement said the action had become necessary in view of pockets of kidnap incidents and other criminal acts in the state. He urged residents of the state to be vigilant and report threats or incidents that may endanger the security and safety of lives and property in the state. “It is important to remind the people that as they embark on pre-sallah celebration activities, they have to be mindful of bag eggs in their midst,” The Commandant expressed worry over criminal activities despite security measures, advising that beside security agencies who are obliged to ensure peace and order, the public should equally consider themselves as critical stakeholders in security and collaborate in information sharing. “While the worrisome situation is accorded the attention it deserves, it is necessary to caution people to guard against activities that increase their vulnerability to attack,” he said. He also warned against travelling at odd hours as well as lonely movements in isolated places and un-necessary display of economic status on the social media among others. To managers and clients of recreational facilities, he urged them to be security conscious by preventing nefarious acts of saboteurs who are desperate to cause harm. Also, religious and traditional rulers as well as parents are urged to contribute their quota by sensitising their subjects and wards to shun illegalities and embrace things that can bring about development.
