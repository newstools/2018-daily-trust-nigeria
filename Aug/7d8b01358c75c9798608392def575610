The Ogun State police command has arrested three men in possession of about 40 bags of weeds suspected to be Indian hemp. The suspects were Frank Osai, 39; Elvis Okuse, 25; and 24-year-old Kelvin Ogagaoghene. The police alleged that the suspects had beaten security check-points at the Lagos-Ogun border and had intended to move the illicit substance to Edo State when the team swooped on them. The three men were said to have been arrested along the Benin/Shagamu expressway on Wednesday August 8, 2018 following an intelligence report the command received that the men had been transporting hard drugs and dangerous weapons through the Lagos-Ogun-Edo states route. Daily Trust learnt that acting on the information, operatives of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad intercepted a truck registration number KPP 339 XD in which they allegedly uncovered 40 bags of weeds suspected to be Indian hemp. The suspects were promptly arrested. The police said that on interrogation, the men confessed they intended to deliver the weeds to a Lagos-based customer they identified as Uche. The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, has ordered a full scale investigation on the activities of the arrested suspects and their sponsors.
