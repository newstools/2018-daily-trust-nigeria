The United States, European Union, African Union and U.N. mission to Congo all commended President Joseph Kabila on Thursday for agreeing not to seek a third term in an election, a decision that has calmed fears of the country sliding into chaos. “We applaud the decision by President Joseph Kabila to respect the Congolese constitution,” said the statement, also signed by Canada and Switzerland. It added that this “constitutes a key stage on the path toward the first peaceful change of power in DRC.”
