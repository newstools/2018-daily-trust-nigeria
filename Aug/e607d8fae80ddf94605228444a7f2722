A 58-year-old self-acclaimed pastor, Abel Olukayode, is to spend four  and half years in jail for stealing N984,450 from Wema Bank Plc.

Omoyele, sentenced Olukayode  without an option of fine after finding him guilty of the offences. Delivering her judgment, Omoyele said the convict was guilty as  charged, and accordingly sentenced him to six months imprisonment on the  first count and two years each for the count two and three. She, however, said that the jail term would run concurrently. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the convict a resident  of No. 26, Sadiku Ayinla St., Odo-kekere in Ikorodu was arrainged on  Nov. 22, 2012.
