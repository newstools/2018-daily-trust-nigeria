The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Osun State has commended the governor of the state Rauf Aregbesola for his commitment to the welfare of the workers.

The Chairman of the NLC in the state, Comrade Jabob Adekomi stated this in a chat with Daily Trust on Thursday.

"I can confirm that the era of half or modulated salary is over in Osun state," he said. It ended in June and the era of full salary has started in July. 

"We have taken July salary in full. No more half or modulated salary in Osun. We hope to get the arrears of the modulated salary and government is committed to pay the arrears."

A senior civil servant in the state, Pastor James Oloyede confirmed that he has received his salary for the month of July paid in full. 

Oloyede who is the Director of Nutrition Services and Health Education in the Osun State Primary Health Care Development Board said "I have received my salary for July and I got full salary".

It would be recalled that Aregbesola came up with the idea of paying modulated salary when the state was incapacitated to pay salaries of its entire workers due to economic hardship during the recession.

In the modulated salary arrangement, only the workers on level seven downward get their salary in full. The workers in the levels eight and above get 75 percent and 50 percentage depending on seniority.
