An expensive gift, which an armed robbery suspect, Badmus Yusuf, was said to have offered his mother, has exposed him to the police. The police command in Lagos said that Yusuf had given his mother the gift, which was allegedly part of items members of his gang had stolen from a warehouse. Detectives had been investigating robbers’ invasion of a warehouse belonging to one Kingsley Ochoma, at Graceland Estate, Isheri-Osun, Lagos State, when they tracked two of the stolen handsets to the suspect’s mother, identified as Mrs Badmus, and to one Kareem. During interrogation, Mrs Badmus and Kareem were said to have confessed that the stolen telephones were given to them by Yusuf as Sallah gift, unknown to them that Yusuf was a wanted armed robbery suspect. Mrs Badmus and Kareem, according to the State Commissioner of Police, Mr Edgal Omihimi, led the operatives to Yusuf’s house, where he was arrested. Edgal added that when a search was conducted on Yusuf’s apartment, seven of the robbed telephones were recovered. Also allegedly found in the gang’s Nissan Quest vehicle registration number BDG 339 CA, were two locally made cut-to-size double-barrelled guns with three live cartridges. The police said Yusuf led detectives to a hide-out, where three members of his gang  - Chimere Njenobi, Dominic Anawo and Abimbola Austine -  were arrested. According to the CP, the armed robbers, on June 20, 2018, had forced their way into the warehouse while Ochoma was attending to customers, held him and the customers hostage and carted away cartons of phones and accessories worth over N9 million.
