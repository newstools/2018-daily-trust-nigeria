Professor Wole Soyinka has said nobody who decides to leave a party for another should be crucified for making such decision.    Speaking in Lagos Thursday at the presentation of his new book ‘Who Is Watching The Watchmen?’, Soyinka noted that some politicians defect because of their ill intentions.  He also criticized the reactions that followed the defection of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state.
