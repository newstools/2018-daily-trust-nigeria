Eight 5,000-year-old artefacts looted from Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein will be returned after being identified by the British Museum. The objects were seized by police from a now-defunct London dealer in 2003. The collection has spent 15 years in the hands of the state but has now been established as being from a site in Tello in southern Iraq. The items, which include a marble bull pendant, will be presented to the Iraqi embassy in London on Friday. The British Museum’s director Hartwig Fischer said the organisation was “absolutely committed to the fight against illicit trade and damage to cultural heritage”. In addition to the bull pendant, the collection - which dates back to 3000BC - includes a gypsum mace head, two stamp seals, an inscribed pebble and three clay cones bearing Sumerian cuneiform script.
