Chairman of the Northern Senators Forum, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, has harped on the need for the electorate to obtain the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC), describing it as a very potent weapon to either vote in or vote out candidates seeking to occupy elective offices. “Any electorate who fails to collect the card would disenfranchise himself or herself during the forthcoming general elections,” he said. The Senator, representing Sokoto-north senatorial district, stated this in Sokoto when some youths and women groups visited him. He added: “Without it, one would not be able to exercise his constitutional responsibility of casting his or her vote in the nation’s electoral process.” Wamakko stressed the need for people of the state to shun all acts capable of breaching peace and unity. “We should therefore as patriotic citizens continue to uphold the noble virtues of peace, unity and love for one another, irrespective of religious, ethnic or political affinities,” he said. Wamakko described peace as a veritable tool of national development. “Without peace”, he said, “no nation can prosper”.
