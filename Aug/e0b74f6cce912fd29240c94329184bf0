Dozens of families from North and South Korea have held emotional reunions as relatives met for the first time in at least 65 years. A group of mostly elderly South Koreans travelled to a tourist resort in the North for the event, the first such reunion for three years. The Korean War of 1950-1953 left the peninsula divided and people on the northern side were unable to leave. The South Koreans were chosen by lottery - the oldest of them is 101. These brief meetings are likely to be the last and only time many will see each other. There are 83 North Koreans and 89 from the South taking part. A hundred people had been selected by each side, but some dropped out after realising the relatives they had hoped to see were no longer alive.
