The governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party for the September 22nd election in Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke, has faulted the arrest of the principal of Ede Muslim High School, Abbass Adejare, for issuing him a testimonial. Adeleke, in a statement yesterday by the Director of Media and Publicity of his campaign organization, Olawale Rasheed, described the arrest of the principal as “unwarranted politicization of a routine school administrative process.” The PDP candidate, who noted that Adejare was being held at Alagbon in Lagos, called on the police to release him unconditionally. The statement partly read: “We are constrained to issue this statement on the recent arrest and persecution of the Principal of Ede Muslim High School over false accusations of forged school Testimonial issued to Senator Ademola Adeleke as a former student of the school because of a date error.” “We note with great alarm the politically motivated arrest and unwarranted media attacks designed as a tool of  harassment, persecution and character assassination of the PDP flag bearer; Senator Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke.”
