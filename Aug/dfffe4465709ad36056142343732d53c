The Osun State High Court presided over by Justice David Oladimeji yesterday dismissed a suit challenging the eligibility of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party for the September 22 governorship election in the State. The plaintiffs, Rasheed Olabayo and Oluwaseun Idowu, who are members of the PDP in Osun, had alleged that Adeleke did not possess a secondary school certificate and urged the court to restrain the PDP from presenting him to the Independent National Electoral Commission as its candidate. They had also urged the court to restrain the INEC from accepting Adeleke from PDP as its candidate alleging that he was not qualified. But in his ruling, the judge said the claims could not disqualify Adeleke from contesting the election because the constitution does not state that a candidate for the office of the governor must possess a certificate. Justice Oladimeji said the constitution only stipulates that the candidate must be educated up to the secondary school level. He noted that the plaintiffs also admitted that Adeleke  attended Ede Grammar School. The judge, therefore, struck out the case. The counsel to the plaintiffs, Olufemi Ayandokun as well as counsels to Adeleke and the PDP, Edmund Biriomoni and Taofeeq Olayiwola lauded the judgment.
