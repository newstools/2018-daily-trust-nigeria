The Wife of the President, Aisha Buhari on Thursday praised the wives of military men and police officers over their role in the defence and security of the country. She said they deserve more accolades than they get for providing the stabilizing social and economic environment for security personnel charged with the defence of the country. Aisha Buhari who was represented by the wife of the acting President, Dolapo Osinbajo made this known  in Abuja, during a two-day national conference of Defence and Police Officers Wives Association (DEPOWA). The conference which is in collaboration with the Nigeria Defence Academy is themed, “The Role of Defence and Police Officers Wives in National Defence, Peace and Security in Nigeria: Issues, Challenges and Way Forward.” She said the women do not get enough recognition for being, “those who take care of those who take care of us.” She commended their resilience in maintaining stability at the home front in spite of issues like loneliness, lost husbands and children that are angry and frustrated over the absence of their fathers. She said a mother is in pains when she does not hear from her son or husband who is away on posting at the war front. She added that Nigeria owe a debt of gratitude for the women who agreed to marry and be companions to men who choose jobs that can take their lives. She noted that adequate educationa; facilities and social empowerment programs in the military and police barracks would help lessen some of the challenges faced by military families.
