A Member of the House of Representatives, Beni Lar (Langtang North/South), has advised the PDP not to change its name. Lar, who said such move could be counter-productive, added that it might not advance the course of the party as being adduced in some quarters. Speaking with newsmen in Jos, the Plateau State capital, Lar insisted that the PDP remained a brand name in Nigeria. The daughter of the pioneer National Chairman of the PRepresentatives, Beni Lar DP, late Chief Solomon Lar, said the suggestion about the need to change name ahead of the general elections in 2019 was not entirely genuine and accurate. The lawmaker said the name was not the party’s problem but a shift from the dreams of the founding fathers of the party. She said the crisis bedevilling the ruling APC was a good opportunity for the PDP to retake its governance of the nation, stating that the APC had not given a good account of itself. The legislator called on PDP leaders at national and state levels to ensure that all the party’s aspirants were given a level-playing field at the primaries.
