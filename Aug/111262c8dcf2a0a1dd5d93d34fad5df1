The pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, yesterday condemned the impeachment notice served Benue State Governor Sam Ortom by eight members of the state House of Assembly and the purported suspension 15 of their colleagues. Afenifere, in a communique issued after a meeting in Akure, Ondo State Capital, described the development as a legislative rascality. The group also condemned the use of money as an instrument of election into public offices by contestants and their parties, asking the Independent National Electoral Commission to prosecute offenders. “Afenifere demands from INEC to adhere to the highest standard in election transparency, failing which Nigeria will lose faith in its ability to conduct free, fair and credible election in 2019”. It expressed worry over the degenerating insecurity in the country, saying “It is our view that the federal government’s failure to take decisive steps in curtailing security breaches is not only encouraging perpetrators, it is accentuating insecurity and seriously endangering the lives of millions of Nigerians”. Afenifere said restructuring Nigeria remained a fundamental solution to the nation’s challenges.
