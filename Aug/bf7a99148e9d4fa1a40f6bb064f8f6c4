South Sudan President Salva Kiir offered amnesty to all those involved in the nation’s bloody five-year civil war as part of a recent agreement to end the fighting. Rebel leader Riek Machar was among those granted a pardon by Kiir. Those who “waged war against in the government” were granted a general amnesty, Kiir stated late Wednesday. The president also reiterated a call for his forces to observe a ceasefire agreed in June by both the government and Machar’s rebels.
