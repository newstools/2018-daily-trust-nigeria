For the first time, scientists have directly observed definitive  evidence of water ice on the moon’s surface, U.S. space agency NASA has  said. Most of the newly found water ice lies in the shadows of craters near  the moon’s polar regions, where sunlight never reaches and the warmest  temperatures never reach above minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit (about minus  157 degrees Celsius), NASA said in a statement.  “These ice deposits are patchily distributed and could possibly be ancient,” the NASA said.  “At the southern pole, most of the ice is concentrated at lunar  craters, while the northern pole’s ice is more widely, but sparsely  spread,” NASA added.  Previous observations found possible signs of surface ice at the  lunar south pole, but these could have been explained by other  phenomena, such as unusually reflective lunar soil.  In the latest study, scientists used data from NASA’s Moon Mineralogy  Mapper (M3) instrument to confirm the presence of solid ice on the  moon.  M3 collected data that not only picked up the reflective properties  of ice, but was able to directly measure the distinctive way its  molecules absorb infrared light, so as to differentiate between liquid  water or vapor and solid ice.  “With enough ice sitting at the surface — within the top few  millimetres — water would possibly be accessible as a resource for  future expeditions to explore and even stay on the Moon, and potentially  easier to access than the water detected beneath the Moon’s surface,”  NASA said.  “Learning more about this ice, how it got there, and how it interacts  with the larger lunar environment will be a key mission focus for NASA  and commercial partners, as we endeavor to return to and explore our  closest neighbor, the Moon,” NASA added.  The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday. (Xinhua/NAN)
