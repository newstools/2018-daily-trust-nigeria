The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied claims that its investigation into financial crimes in Benue State is a stunt allegedly scripted by Senate President Bukola Saraki. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren in a statement yesterday said the commission’s attention has been drawn to a syndicated article by Senator Babafemi Ojudu, special adviser to the President on Political Matters entitled, ‘Fifth Columnists in Our Recent History’. Uwujaren noted that the EFCC took exception to the article, where Ojudu portrayed the commission as a conscript in the plots by Saraki to undermine the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. Ojudu said in his article that, “From the shenanigans at the Benue House of Assembly, to the siege on National Assembly, the attack on judge’s home in the night, the so called barricade of the Senate President’s house. “The laughable kidnap of Boy Dino and his eleven hours on a tree, the freezing of Benue and Akwa Ibom accounts all are scripted, produced and acted by Oloye Productions,” he said. Uwujaren, however, noted that, “the commission takes exception at the attempt to impute false motive to its investigative activities.” He said “The recent placement of a ‘Post No Debit Order’ on some accounts in Benue and Akwa Ibom States were the culmination of many months of painstaking investigation activities. “To reduce such activities to the level of a stunt in a real or imaginary script by any politician is outrageous. “It is important to state that the EFCC is not a party to the so called script by Saraki. Members of the public should disregard the innuendo in Ojudu’s article as it is unfounded. “The Commission calls for circumspection on the part of political leaders, while urging them to seek clarification before making comments on matters they do not know about.”
