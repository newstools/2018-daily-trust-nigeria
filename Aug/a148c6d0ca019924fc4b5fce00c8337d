Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant-General  Tukur Buratai, has continued to receive commendations for his transparent handling of the war against terrorism in the country, it has been observed. A researcher in conflict prevention and management, Ifure Ifure said the transparency of the COAS is responsible for the recent turn of the tide against  Boko Haram in their campaign against the Nigerian state. Ifure who is also the secretary-general of the Centre for International and Strategic Studies, Abuja, stated this against the backdrop of allegations of corruption in the military. In a statement, he said those behind the publications accusing the military of corruption must be seen by Nigerians as enemies of humanity even as such persons do not mean well for the country. He said, "This kind of propaganda is the handiwork of anarchists who have continued to benefit from the crisis around the nation and have vowed to ensure the terror continues.  Their comments are aimed at discrediting the army and further causing disaffection for their own pecuniary reasons.” According to him, the fight against terrorism in Nigeria and other armed conflicts took a totally new dimension when Lieutenant General Buratai came on board as Chief of Army Staff, acknowledging that the COAS was able to totally overhaul the entire Nigerian Army in its operations and approach to the war against terrorism. The conflict resolution expert said it took the Buhari administration less than one year to achieve the necessary milestones and begin to record positive results because of the army chief's transparency and how critical the management of financial resources is to the operation of the military anywhere in the world. “We definitely need to support the military and the service chiefs because a lot of evil is being perpetuated in the land and only a collective action would save the nation from collapse,” he said.
