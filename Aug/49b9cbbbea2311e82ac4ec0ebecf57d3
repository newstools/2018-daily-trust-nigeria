Libya’s coast guard picked up 574 migrants from inflatable boats in three operations on Monday off the North African country’s coast, naval forces spokesman Ayoub Qassem told Reuters. He said the migrants included 388 men, 66 women and 19 children. Two boats were picked up near the town of Zawiya and one off Qarabulli, Qassem said on Wednesday, adding that the migrants came from different sub-Saharan and Arab countries. “All illegal migrants were brought to Tripoli’s Abu Sitah naval base and then handed over to Illegal Migration Department,” he said.
