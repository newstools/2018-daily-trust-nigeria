Nigeria's Minister of  Interior Abdulrahman Dambazau has claimed the insecurity situation in  the country may have been politically induced. Dambazau  made this claim while speaking at the opening ceremony of a one-day  emergency meeting on insecurity in the country in Abuja on Thursday.

"Ethnic  identity politics contribute to conflicts in Nigeria especially through  manipulation of ethnic demographics to cause disunity and promote  rebellion against the government.

"We  are not dealing with conventional threats, but peculiar threats that  are laced with terrorism, sabotage and efforts to manipulate our  society's fault lines of religion and ethnicity.

"There  are indications that some of these threats are politically motivated  from within the country; some are induced from the outside of the  country by those who are not comfortable with Nigeria's potentials", he  said.

The  minister however, reminded the gathering- made up of top security  officers in the country- that allÂ  the security agencies must articulate  their plans to contain, control and prevent threats in the country.

"I  believe that the take off point for tackling insecurity in Nigeria is  intelligence; actionable intelligence for that matter," he pointed out.

While  discouraging independent operation by security agencies, he stressed  the need for coordination, cooperation and collaboration among them.
