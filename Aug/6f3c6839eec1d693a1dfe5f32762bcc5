The Minister of Sport and Youth Development, Barr. Solomon Dalung, has urged Tarok indigenes residing in Kwali Area Council to continue to live in peace. Dalung, who was represented by his personal assistant, Mr. Namsel Nimyel, stated this when he launched a new bus procured by the Kwali chapter of the Ndammalam Ngwang Ishi Tarok Association (NIO) yesterday. He said he was impressed with the Kwali residents for embracing his kinsmen as brothers, adding that the relationship between the Tarok indigenes and natives of Kwali was a long standing one. “I think other ethnic communities in Nigeria should emulate the relationship between Tarok people of Plateau State and Kwali natives as the relationship didn’t start today,” he said. The minister said Kwali has been a second home not only for the Tarok, but other ethnic groups in Nigeria. He therefore thanked the council boss, Joseph Shazin and the Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo, for accommodating other ethnic groups in their area. Also speaking, the chairman of Kwali Area Council, Mr. Joseph Shazin, said there was need for other ethnic groups in the country to emulate the Tarok in the area on love for one another. He said if other ethnic groups can come together and keep tribal or ethnic differences aside to cohabit with each other, the country will continue to witness peace and rapid development. “I want to urge other ethnic groups to emulate the Tarok indigenes of Plateau in Kwali as their relationship with us over the years has always been cordial,” he said. The chairman commended the executive members of the Tarok association for their support to his administration, adding that he has always appointed Tarok indigenes into his cabinet.
