The Governor of Plateau Simon Bako Lalong has said that his administration has collaborated with security agencies to bring to an end to the attacks on communities by criminal elements who are bent on taking the state back to the dark days.  In a statement signed by the Commissioner of Information & Communication, Yakubu Dati, the governor commiserated with the people of Foron particularly, Abonong where eight people were killed and many houses were burnt. Lalong said that he has directed security agencies to leave no stone on unturned in ensuring that the perpetrators of the dastardly act are brought to justice.  The governor added that various peace initiatives have been put in place to ensure lasting peace in the state.  Lalong also commiserated with all those who lost their loved ones and property including the Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN) which lost a priest and his family in the attack.  The Governor appreciated COCIN for providing sanctuary for some IDPs as well as other organizations for their role in bringing succor to victims of conflict.  He implored citizens not to take laws into their hands when provoked but collaborate with security agencies to prevent any brake down of law and order.
