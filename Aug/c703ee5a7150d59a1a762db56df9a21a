The Akwa Ibom State government weekend said a former governor of the state, Godwin Akpabio, commissioned the Ikot Ekpene-Uyo Road at 42 percent completion. The state’s Commissioner for Information and Strategies, Charlse Udoh, made the allegation weekend. Akpabio last week defected from the People’s Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. The commissioner said it was not possible for Governor Udom Emmanuel to complete the road in three years while Akpabio could not complete it in eight years.
