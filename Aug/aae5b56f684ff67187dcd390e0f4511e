The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned what it called unfortunate invasion of the National Assembly by security forces. The APC, in a statement through its Acting National Publicity Secretary, Mr Yekini Nabena, dissociated itself from what it regarded as an act of “brigandage and affront on the sacred symbols of our budding democracy”. The party, which affirmed its commitment to remain a law abiding political organisation, advised every constituent part to abide by the tenets of the Constitution and Nigeria’s democracy. It called for a more harmonious working relationship between the various arms of government in the general interest of the country. “Whilst our contention with the leadership of the National Assembly as currently constituted is a matter of public record, we still believe that the legislature as an independent arm of government must be allowed free reign for vibrant contestation of ideas and values amongst its members within the context of their constitutional mandate and for the benefit of the Nigerian people,” the APC said.
