The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has distanced its Group Managing Director, Dr Maikanti Baru from trending reports insinuating that he had doled out funds to effect the impeachment of Senate President Bukola Saraki. The corporation in a statement by its spokesman Ndu Ughamadu said the report was the handiwork of mischief makers seeking to drag the NNPC and its GMD into political affair totally different from its mandate. The NNPC said the report was not only false but an affront on the verifiable reforms in the operations of the corporation under Dr Baru. The statement said it was mere fiction and outright “tales by moonlight” for anybody to insinuate that Dr Baru or anybody else could just take a dip into the corporation’s till and dole out the volume of funds being portrayed in the phantom report for political purpose. The NNPC called on all well-meaning members of the public and oil and gas industry stakeholders to discountenance the said story.
