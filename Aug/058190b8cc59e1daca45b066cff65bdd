Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu yesterday said his health made the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to postpone his planned interrogation over allegations of financial misdeed. Ekweremadu said no interrogation took place Wednesday, neither did he have high blood pressure as reported by some section of the media. He said after reporting at the commission on Wednesday, he told them that he was not feeling well, and after a confirmation by the EFCC doctor, he was allowed to go and attend to his health until a new date was fixed for the interrogation. A statement by Ekweremadu’s Special Adviser on Media, Uche Anichukwu, in Abuja yesterday described the reports as “mischief and orchestrated media trial”.
