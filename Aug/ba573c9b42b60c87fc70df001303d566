Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank, has described the anti-corruption war by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government as dead. Frank in a statement in Abuja on Monday, alleged that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has accommodated those it once termed as corrupt and looters of the economy. "It is now clear that Buhari is not fighting corruption. The President has killed the anti-corruption crusade. “If not, how do we explain the administration’s open arms reception for defectors from opposition political parties that it hitherto tagged corrupt into the APC? “They now wine and dine with opposition political party members - both in Nigeria and in diaspora - they have all along termed corrupt in order to reap political benefits from their states of influence during the 2019 elections. “However, they want unsuspecting Nigerians and members of the international community to believe that the wide scale violation of the fundamental human rights of innocent Nigerians is a sign that the anti-corruption war is being prosecuted in the interest of the country,” he stated.
