The Ondo State government has said that it will be employing more health workers for effective health delivery in the state. This was disclosed by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu  while hosting the newly inaugurated national executive council of the Association of  Community Pharmacists of Nigeria, in Akure. The state government had often said that qualitative health care and social services delivery was one of its five-point agenda. About a week ago, the government had distributed multi-million naira medical and laboratory equipment to the health facilities across the 18 local government areas of the state. Gov Akeredolu had ordered the Commissioner for Health, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, to submit a memo for the increment of slots for pharmacist internship to enable student-pharmacists have an avenue to acquire the required training. He also disclosed he would establish five additional Mother and Child Hospitals to enable people in the other senatorial districts of the state have access to maternal health care. According to the governor, the arrangement he met on ground where the only two Mother and Child Hospitals were located in the central senatorial district was not acceptable. What becomes of pregnant women in the north and southern senatorial districts?” he wondered. Led by its Chairman, Mr Samuel Adekola, the pharmacist association commended Gov Akeredolu for his health policy, saying pharmacists were ready to cooperate with the government in moving the state forward. Adekola commended Akeredolu’s health programmes and policies, particularly the Contributory Health programme, which he described as “all-inclusive and implementable”.
