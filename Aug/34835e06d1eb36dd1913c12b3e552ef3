The State-Based Mobiliser (SBM) of the Nigeria Aids Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS) in the FCT, Dr. Elisha Andebutop, has said the agency will conduct free HIV/AIDS and hepatitis screening in Abaji Area Council. Dr. Andebutop stated this when he led some members of the agency on an advocacy visit to the Abaji Council Boss, Alhaji Abdulraman Ajiya, yesterday. He informed the chairman that  Gawu, Rimba, Mawogi and some areas in Abaji Town had been enumerated for the free exercise. He said the essence of the free HIV/AIDS and hepatitis test was to enhance better healthcare service planning by government. “As I speak, we have 105 enumerated areas across the country, while we have four areas in Abaji. And as we embark on this free screening exercise, it will help in assisting government know the actual number of people infected with HIV/AIDS,” he said. The Chairman of the council, Abdulraman Ajiya, thanked the agency for the visit and assured it of the council’s support and cooperation throughout the exercise. “I will also want to urge you that after identifying those areas, you should also try to find out the wards so that the councillors or special advisers from such wards will also be of help,” he said.
