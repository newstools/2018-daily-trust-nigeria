Police in Bayelsa State yesterday said that the command has deployed more personnel to Twon Brass in Brass Local Government Area of the state over last Monday clash between the supporters of All Progressives Congress (APC) and those of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), where three persons were allegedly killed. The state Commissioner of Police,  Mr Austin Iwar, while speaking with newsmen in Yenagoa, said the case in Twon Brass is merely a homicide, adding that they have arrested some suspects and investigation is on-going. The Bayelsa State government had imposed a curfew in the affected area to forestall any incident that could cause more problems. According to the police commissioner, “in Twon Brass, we are dealing with a case of homicide.  There was a crisis there and two people were killed. We have made some arrests and investigation is on-going.  We have also sent a detachment of mobile police to the area to maintain peace and bring down tension.” “We have also improved our intelligence to fetch out those that perpetrated the crisis. We urge the community and vigilante groups to always give useful information to the police, because crime prevention cannot be left in the hands of police alone. “I have received adequate briefs on the security concerns of the state which are mainly socio-political misunderstandings, as experienced in the recent clash in Brass Local Government. Other crimes such as cultism, armed robbery, rape, stealing etc, will be decisively dealt with so that our community will be safer,” he stated.
