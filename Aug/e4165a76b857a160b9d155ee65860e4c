When contacted about the procedures to obtain the PVCs, Mr Rotimi Lawrence Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said the presentation of the temporary voter’s card (TVC) was necessary. “When you register, they give you a TVC, which  is temporary voter’s card. When you want to collect your permanent voter’s card (PVC), you take the TVC along. They just look for your name and you submit your TVC. Then you collect your PVC. The process is as simple as that,” said Oyekanmi. Daily Trust reports that the figures have largely remained the same with those earlier released by the electoral body in April this year.
