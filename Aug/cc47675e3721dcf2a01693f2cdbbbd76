Former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Timi Alaibe, has condoled with the Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, over the death of his mother, Madam GoldCoast Dickson; aged 72. In a letter of condolence, Alaibe said the unexpected news of the demise of Madam Dickson brought back the sad feelings he personally experienced over the death of his mother some years back. The pioneer chairman of the Presidential Amnesty Programme urged the governor to thank God for the fruitful life of her mother which built hopes in others and groomed someone who has become the pride of his community. He said while it was natural for Dickson to shed tears and sorrow over her late mother, “I urge you to gather strength and draw inspiration and hope from the fact that she has completed her mission on earth; and she is going home for a warm reception and a deserved peaceful rest.” “It is with deep sympathy and a sense of equal loss that I commiserate with you over the untimely death of your beloved mother and inspiration, Madam GoldCoast Dickson. The feeling that comes with the death of a loved one, particularly a mother such as yours, cannot be measured in words. It is better felt than imagined. “The unexpected news came as a sad reminder of what I personally experienced some years back. I don’t only imagine how you feel; I know that feeling. After a prolonged illness, you hoped for a recovery that would bring her back home. Unfortunately, that has not happened. “Your Excellency, in moments such as this, we can only thank God for the life your dear mother lived; for the lives she affected; for the hopes she built in people; and for grooming someone such as you to become what you have become to your community, your state, your country, and to humanity,” he said.
