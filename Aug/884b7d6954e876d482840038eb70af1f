A private agency in Kenya has launched a campaign asking women who say they have had children with Catholic priests to come forward for DNA tests. DNA Testing Services will carry out the paternity tests on behalf of an unnamed international Catholic organisation. The organisation will then submit a confidential report to the Catholic Church and the Vatican, which will decide what to do with it. Those who turn up for the tests will pay a subsidised fee. Several cases of Catholic priests breaking their vows of celibacy, fathering children and abandoning them have been reported in Kenya. A few have gone to court, while many others are talked about in hushed tones.
