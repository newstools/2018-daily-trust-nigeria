Islamic clerics from Katsina state have called for intensified prayers for President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Aminu Masari giving the present governance challenges before them. Malam Haruna Sani said leaders deserve prayers and support noting that “if a leader fails, we have all failed as well.” He said the present situation we found ourselves are surmountable if we all rally round and do what is expected of us all adding that “a leader cannot succeed without a good followership.” “When you keep praying bad for a country and leadership, the effects and manifestation of what befalls the leader shall affect us all,” he said. For Bishir Ruwangodiya, he said “in as much as we are desirous to succeed as a nation, people must support and be patient with leaders” adding that our role as followers is very detrimental to the success of leaders. He said prayers and patience are great virtues that we all need to imbibe for growth and prosperity of the state and nation in general.
