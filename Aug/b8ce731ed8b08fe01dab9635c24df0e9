A Third Republic Senator, Etang Umoyo, who was touted to return to the PDP, yesterday, failed to show up at the PDP Eket Senatorial District rally for the endorsement of Gov. Udom Emmanuel for a second term. Daily Trust gathered that the development was a disappointment as the senator was said to be absent at the event because he was hospitalised on Sunday. Sen. Umoyo, who represented Eket Senatorial District from 1992 to 1993, last Friday, was said to have held a “chaotic meeting” of some APC members in Esit Eket, his local government area, to inform them of his decamping. The party members, it was learnt, challenged him at the meeting with angry speeches and placards.
