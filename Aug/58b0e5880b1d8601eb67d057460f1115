A homeless man with no arms has been charged with stabbing a tourist with scissors in Miami, Florida, this week. Jonathan Crenshaw, 46, held the blades between his feet to attack Cesar Coronado, 22, just after midnight on Tuesday, police said. Crenshaw is a popular fixture in South Beach and known for painting on canvases along the trendy area, the Miami Herald reported. He told police he was lying down when Coronado, a tourist from Chicago, unexpectedly punched him in the head. A police report said Crenshaw stabbed Coronado twice with the scissors before fleeing the scene. But one of Coronado's friends claimed they were asking Crenshaw for directions when he attacked. He told police the homeless man jumped up and stabbed Coronado in his arm. Miami beach officers are reported to have found the man lying bleeding on the ground. Paramedics took him to Mount Sinai Medical Centre for treatment. Crenshaw meanwhile was charged with aggravated battery. He has been arrested before for offences including trespassing, vandalism and battery, according to the Miami Herald. The Miami New Times profiled Crenshaw in 2011 but he refused to tell them how he lost his arms. Culled from the sun.co.uk
