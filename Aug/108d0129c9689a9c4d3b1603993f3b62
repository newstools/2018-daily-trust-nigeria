Students of Regina Pacis Model Secondary School, a Catholic girlsâ€™ school in Onitsha, Anambra State, won the gold medal in the junior team of the World Technovation Challenge which held at the Silicon Valley, San Francisco, USA, on Thursday. The five girls - Promise Nnalue, Jessica Osita, Nwabuaku Ossai, Adaeze Onuigbo and Vivian Okoye, represented Nigeria and Africa, defeating contenders from America, Spain, Turkey, Uzbekistan and China who were among the 10 finalists of the original 115 who started the competition. The youngsters aged between 12 and 14 developed a mobile app to detect fake drugs. Nnalue, who spoke to Daily Trust Saturday, said they were motivated to embark on the project due to the number of deaths they had heard about in Nigeria as a result of fake drugs. Technovation is a global programme for girls to learn programming skills they need to emerge as tech-entrepreneurs and leaders. Annually, girls are invited to identify a problem in their communities, and are challenged to solve them by developing android applications to address the problem.
