Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are going after some senior staff of the Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB) who were fingered in the loss of over N8 billion revenue, Daily Trust Saturday gathered yesterday. Top EFCC sources hinted that the examination body failed to remit revenues in excess of N8 billion to the federal government between 2010 and 2015. The amount includes unremitted Value Added Tax and Withholding Tax. It was noted that following the surprise remittance of N7.8billion by the Ishaq Oloyede-led management, the government, working on the suspicion that the previous management had defrauded in revenue remittance, ordered a forensic audit of the accounts of JAMB from 2010 to 2015. Sources said the report of the audit committee was turned in some months ago and subsequently forwarded to the EFCC by the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, for investigation. Consequently, the commission set up a panel to review the report and take further steps to bring those indicted to book. An EFCC source said: “We are looking at a number of accounts with suspicious inflows and outflows. From the detailed analyses of the accounts, we have identified a few officers that would help our investigations because funds have been traced to their accounts. Very soon, we will be inviting them for questioning. Among the officers that we may invite are a serving director and a retired director of the examination body.”
