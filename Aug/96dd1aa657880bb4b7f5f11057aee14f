The secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Bako Angulu, has said that the party will spring surprises in the general and area councils’ elections in 2019. Angulu, who addressed newsmen at the party’s secretariat in Abuja, yesterday, said it was fully prepared to contest all elections next year, adding that party stalwarts and stakeholders have been mobilising their supporters to obtain their PVCs. He said the party has also been urging its supporters and members to compare the achievements of the past and present administrations in terms of infrastructures, even as he said the past PDP administration performed creditably well in all ramifications. “Apart from thousands of APC members who have been defecting to PDP, we have registered over 25,000 new members who are ready to work for the success and victory of PDP in the FCT and at the national level,” he said. The PDP scribe expressed confidence that if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) created a free, level playing ground, the party stood the chance to win elections in the FCT.
