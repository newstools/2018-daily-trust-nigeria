Sultanate Council of Sokoto Friday dissociated itself from a post being circulated in the social media which insinuated support of Sultan Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar to the defection of Sokoto state Governor Aminu Tambuwal from APC to PDP. The Sultanate Council debunked the post in a statement in Sokoto, describing it as complete falsehood. It stressed: “Sultan is a father to all Muslims and has no partisan interest and opinion.” The council added that the post which it noted was  by unknown people, is no way connected to it. It reiterated the Sultanate Council neutral stand in politics and urged the public and good people of Nigeria to disregard the post. The council prayed for greater peace and posterity in Nigeria.
