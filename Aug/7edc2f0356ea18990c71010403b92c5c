Moroccans are expressing shock on social media at the details given by a 17-year-old of her rape ordeal. In a TV interview last week, the young woman, being named as Khadija, said she was abducted by a gang in June, held for two months, sexually assaulted and tortured. She also showed scars, cigarette burns and tattoos on her body, which she said were given to her by her captors. In response to the TV interview, which has been posted on YouTube, thousands have signed an online petition calling for help for Khadija. “I want justice for what they did to me,” she told Moroccan station Chouf TV, the Huffington Post reports. “I tried to escape several times, but I was caught and beaten. They tortured me, they did not give me food or drink, and they did not even allow me to take a shower.”
