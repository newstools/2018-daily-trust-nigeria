The Kwara State police command yesterday alerted residents of plans by some miscreants to disrupt the Eid el Kabir and Durbar celebrations in Ilorin, the state capital. The command said it had deployed 2,500 personnel for the two events in the state. The state Commissioner of Police, Aminu Saleh, disclosed this  at a meeting of all principal security agencies with political leaders. Other security agents represented at the meeting included the Department of State Service (DSS), the Nigerian Army and Civil Defence Corps. The political leaders at the meeting were made to sign an undertaking committing them to bear the brunt of any of their members caught fomenting violence during these events. “Feelers have it that the sallah will be disrupted. We want to inform you that we are looking and we are watching. We already identified three modes of dressing that we will look out for. “It was discovered that the plot is being coordinated by top politicians of the major political parties in the state. Checks also indicated that preparatory for the offensive, they have concluded to hire mercenaries from within and outside the state to meet at designated points. “We have intercepted a vehicle loaded with knives. I don’t know if they needed these knives to come and slaughter rams in Ilorin. I am sure every household has a knife to slaughter its animal. We don’t need fresh knives here. We don’t want to lose life of anybody for the purpose of sallah and durbar celebrations,” he said. Saleh cautioned against hate speech, saying “words that are intended to insult, abuse, humiliate, offend, make unhappy a person or group of people because of the person’s political variance, religious belief and ethical differences should be avoided.” The state’s Director of DSS, Mrs. Arthur Worrey, said: “We are sounding this warning because any one caught will face the music. We will not listen to begging. Let us all do what is expected of us.”
