The police yesterday arraigned a 26-year-old man, Joseph James, before an Ogba, Lagos, chief magistrate court for allegedly burgling the Mushin, Lagos, branch of Zenith Bank Plc. The police said that James, with some others still at large, vandalized the property of the bank located along Palm Avenue, Mushin. The prosecutor, Inspector Ekadu Edet, said that the incident took place at night on July 23, 2018. Edet told the court that the accused had attempted to enter the banking hall through the roof but couldn’t. He said that the accused, out of frustration, vandalized the bank’s property that he could lay his hands on. He, however, did not list the items that the accused vandalized during the operation. The prosecutor said when the matter was reported at the Olosan police division, Mushin, policemen from there swung into action and in the process arrested Edet while others ran away. Consequently, James was charged before the court with conspiracy and stealing. He, however, pleaded not guilty. The presiding magistrate, Mr K.O. Ogundare, granted him bail in the sum of N200,000, with two sureties in like sum. He was remanded in prison custody pending when he will perfect his bail conditions, while the matter was adjourned till August 9, 2018.
