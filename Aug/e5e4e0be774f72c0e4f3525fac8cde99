Former Democratic Republic of Congo Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba has arrived home in the capital, Kinshasa, after 11 years in exile and prison. The ex-rebel leader had a war crimes conviction by the International Criminal Court overturned in June. Crowds of his supporters in T-shirts, hats and scarves bearing his face met him at the airport. He has declared his intention to contest the long-delayed presidential election in December. But President Joseph Kabilaâ€™s government says he is not eligible because of a corruption conviction. Mr Bemba is currently appealing against that conviction, which relates to witness tampering during his trial at The Hague. No date has been fixed for the verdict.
