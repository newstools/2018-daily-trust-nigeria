Supporters of the Kwankwasiyya group, under the auspices of Tricycle Riders Association of Nigeria, Kano State chapter, have dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for All Progressives Congress (APC). The defection coincided with the day, the national leader of Kwankwasiyya, Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, declared his ambition, in Abuja, to run for president in the 2019 general elections. The defectors, who were received at the Sani Abacha Indoor Stadium by the APC state chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Abbas, burnt hundreds of red caps, one of the symbols of the Kwankwasiyya movement. The leader of the defectors, Sani Sharu Dala, said they dumped the PDP and Kwankwasiyya courtesy of the laudable youth empowerment programmes the APC-led government had been introducing since it assumed office in 2015. Receiving the defectors, Abbas, who told them that the APC is their home, added that they were misled to join the PDP for someone else’s personal interest.
