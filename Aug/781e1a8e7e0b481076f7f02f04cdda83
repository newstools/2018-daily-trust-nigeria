Zimbabwe’s opposition leader Nelson Chamisa has said he was “winning resoundingly” but the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said official results were yet to be announced. Chamisa, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said on Tuesday that his party had the results from 10,000 polling stations. Hours after the opposition leader made the claim, President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the ruling ZANU-PF said he was “positive” of the election outcome. “I am delighted by the high turnout and citizen engagement so far. The information from our reps on the ground is extremely positive!” Mnangagwa, 75, said on Twitter. The president added that he was waiting for the official results from the Electoral Commission, which had urged the contesting candidates to wait for final results before making any announcements.
