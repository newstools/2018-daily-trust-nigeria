A passenger plane has crashed in the capital of Mexico’s Durango state, just moments after take-off. All 103 passengers and crew on board the Aeroméxico flight survived the crash but 97 of them are injured. State Governor José Rosas Aispuro said the plane was hit by a gust of wind which caused a sudden descent. Its left wing then touched the ground and two engines broke off. Most of the passengers were able to walk away before it caught fire. Aeroméxico flight AM2431 was flying from Guadalupe Victoria International Airport in Durango to Mexico City when it crashed at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT). Initial reports spoke of 97 passengers and four crew, but Governor Rosas said that two children were also on board - bringing the total to 103.
