Manchester United are going to make three signings on deadline day, according to former defender Gary Neville. United have been frustrated in the past few weeks as deals for the likes of Harry Maguire, Toby Alderweireld and Jerome Boateng have seemingly all failed to materialise. And with the transfer window closing at 5pm today, time is running out for any new players to sign. But Neville has spectacularly suggested United could end the window with three new players. He wrote on Twitter: “It’s #DeadlineDay! Watch it all unfold on Sky Sports News! United are gonna buy 3!!!”
