The Board of Police Service Commission (PSC) has assured police trainees (student-police personnel) of better times ahead as the board was working to improve their welfare. Chairman of the board, Mr Musiliu Smith, said this on Tuesday when he addressed police trainees at the Police College in Oji River, Enugu State after he led the board members on tour and assessment of the institution. Daily Trust reports that the tour and assessment of the institution was part of a two-day working visit of members of the PSC Board to Enugu State Police command and its formations as well as Police College, Oji River. It noted that a total of 659 police trainees are currently undergoing training expected to last between nine months and 12 months at the Police College. Represented by a commissioner in the board, Mr Austin Braimoh, the chairman assured the police trainees that their situation would be improved. Smith said: “We have equally assured them that their sacrifice to the nation will not be misplaced. We sincerely appreciate what they are going through; we hope that we can do far more to better their lot and appreciate them better.” The new board, he said, is here to make a difference in impacting greatly and positively on the Nigeria Police Force. According to Smith, who is a former Inspector General of Police, “We are going to make sure that by the time we are living, things will never be the same again. We want to assure all police officers and men and all Nigerians that a new sheriff is in town. “And President Muhammadu Buhari having assembled and put the caliber of men and women on this board together, things will definitely change for those in training and police officers and men already serving,” he said.
