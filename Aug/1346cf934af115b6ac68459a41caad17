Deputy Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, John Audu Kwaturu and the member representing Kudan state constituency in the Assembly,  Junaidu Yakubu, have defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

Kwataru who spoke with newsmen on phone said he has submitted his letter of withdrawal of membership of the APC to his Kwataru ward in Kachia local government area. 

"I have left the APC for the PDP, my reasons for leaving the APC are stated in the letter to my Kwataru ward.

"It will interest you to know that even my ward chairman has left the APC" he said. 

Yakubu on the other hand, announced his defection to the PDP in a letter dated August 7, 2018 and addressed to the APC ward chairman in Hunkuyi Ward, Kudan Local government area of Kaduna state. 

Yakubu, in the letter, said his decision to leave  the APC was informed by the fact that the leadership of the party at the state and local government levels had become draconian. 

"I write to withdraw my membership of the APC with effect from today, August 7, 2018. This becomes imperative in view of the draconian leadership of the party at state level and the local government level as well," Yakubu stated in his letter. 

The lawmaker said he consulted with the people of his constituency before taking the action.
