Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has charged members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) posted to the state to respect the traditions, norms and customs of communities where they would undertake their primary assignment. Ortom gave the charge on Monday at the closing ceremony of 2018 Batch B Orientation course at the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp in Wannune in Tarka Local Government Area of the state. He assured that adequate measures have been put in place to ensure the security and safety of the corps members, adding that he was encouraged by the report received from the camp management about the beautiful conduct of the corps members throughout the orientation course. The governor who was represented at the ceremony by his Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Prof. Dennis Ityavyar, also urged the new corp membera to remain diligent in carrying out any assignment that will be given to them and warned Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) against rejecting any corp member posted to them. Earlier, the State Coordinator of NYSC, Mrs. Eno Herbert Awakessien, who showered praises on the 2018 NYSC Batch B Corps members implored them to try and satisfy the needs of their host communities in order to leave footprints in the sands of history. She singled out corp member, Andy Godspower Tari-B with code number 0372 for his exemplary behaviour by returning a pouch containing N14, 000 to the camp management, stressing that he would be recognized in the scheme’s book of remembrance.
