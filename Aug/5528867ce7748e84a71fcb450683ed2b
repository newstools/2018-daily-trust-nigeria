Borno state Coordinator of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Audu Musa Idowu, has challenged youths to embrace the opportunities that come with the recently signed ‘not too young to run’ bill to vie for all political positions in the upcoming 2019 general elections. The coordinator made the call in Kano shortly after he was presented, with the Sir Ahmadu Bello Platinum Leadership Award by the Association of Northern Nigeria Students. According to him, Nigerian youths should consider the opportunities given as an avenue for effective generational change in terms of leadership at all levels from the old to the young. “To me, I see an opportunity for Nigerian youths as formidable contenders for all political seats including the Presidential seat. Therefore, Nigerian youths must compulsorily stamp out the twin evils of cultism and drugs abuse, so as to defend their integrity and reinforce the citizen’s confidence on them,” he said. In his remarks, the President of the northern student’s association Comrade Usman Sa’idu, stated that the recipient was selected based on his contribution to healthcare delivery system in the country, as well as his support toward the positive youth’s growth and peaceful coexistence.
