The Emir of Daura, Umar Faruq Umar, has pleaded for federal projects in his domain. He made the plea yesterday while receiving the Minister of Agriculture, Audu Ogbe. The emir said despite having the country’s president from Daura, the town is still lagging behind in terms of federal presence especially in projects’ siting. He said the emirate has vast land that could be harnessed for massive production of agricultural products. Earlier, Ogbe said his ministry would look into the issue, especially with the proposed establishment of new rice mills across the country. The minister said there would be massive tomato production in the state.
