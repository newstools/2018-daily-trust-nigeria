The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, yesterday said the Nigerian army and other security agencies must be apolitical. He said while commissioning an army training school at the 6 Division in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Buratai, represented by the General Officer Commanding 82 Division of the Nigerian Army, Enugu, Major-General Addo Baba Abubarkar, said: “We are all aware of the security challenges faced in the country. The Nigerian army and other security agencies in this region and indeed in the nation at large must continue to be professional in our callings and apolitical. “The only way we can achieve this is by giving officers and men of the Nigerian Army quality training which the school is aimed at providing to complement other training from the Nigerian Army training institutions.” Earlier, the General Officer Commanding 6 Division, Port Harcourt, Major-General Musa Yusuf, had said the current transformational drive in the Nigerian army reserved a place of pride for training and retraining of Nigerian Army personnel for individual and collective development.
