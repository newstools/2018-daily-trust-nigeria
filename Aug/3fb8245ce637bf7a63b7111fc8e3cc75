 A poll conducted by CBS News showed that 61 per cent of U.S. citizens believe that racial tensions in the country have strengthened over the past year, since the far-right nationalists’ rally in the city of Charlottesville. Only 10 per cent of people noted a drop in racial tensions, while 29 per cent saw no difference, a CBS News poll, conducted by YouGov, showed. The findings revealed that the share of those reporting the rise in racial tensions increased to 78 per cent among black Americans and dropped to 56 per cent among white U.S. citizens. As many as 58 per cent of people did not approve President Donald Trump’s approach to racial issues, with respondents having been sharply split over the issue by race and political affiliation. It is noteworthy that the level of dissatisfaction rose to 82 and 73 per cent among black U.S. citizens and Hispanics, respectively. White people, however, also tended to disapprove the president’s handling of the issue, with 51 per cent of the group expressing their dissatisfaction. A whopping 83 per cent of Republicans predictably approved of the president’s approach, while 90 per cent of Democrats thought otherwise. The poll was conducted among 2,238 U.S. adults from Aug. 8 to Aug. 10, with the approximate margin of error estimated at 2.5 per cent. On Aug. 11, 2017, torch-wielding white supremacists held a rally near the University of Virginia which resulted in a brawl with a group of counter-protesters. On Aug. 12, 2017, a major Unite the Right rally gathered thousands of far-right nationalists in downtown Charlottesville, protesting against the authorities’ plans to remove a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a local square. The rally led to violence between the demonstrators and counter-protesters, culminating in a car ramming attack, which left one person dead and dozens injured.
