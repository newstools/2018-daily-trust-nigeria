The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, Abdullahi Adamu Candido has urged aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC) to run an issue-based campaign by avoiding character assassination and abusing of opponents. Candido who spoke during the inauguration of the ward party executives, said politics of bitterness would not benefit the party and the individuals adding that elections are not won on how much ill you speak of your opponents. “I am an advocate of peaceful politicking. I don’t subscribe to character assassination and image laundering. Politics is a game and you don’t need to assassinate people’s character because you want to gain power. You don’t assassinate character and think that is the way to get into office,” he said. Candido who had stated his desire to run for a second term in office assured residents of renewed service should he be given a second chance. In his response the chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT, Alhaji Abdulmalik Usman also urged aspirants to go about their activities with a sense of responsibility. “If you are aspiring for any position in the FCT, you should do it in a civilised way. The era of thuggery is over, we are now in the era whereby politicians would have to use their brain,” he said. While commending Candido for the projects executed, he urged party members to support his re-election bid, “We must ensure that the chairman returns during the election. The chairman has said that his seat is not vacant but we at the state executives are saying his ticket is sealed.”
