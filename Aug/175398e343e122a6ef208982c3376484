A youth organization in Osun State, Kimpact Development Initiative (KDI), has concluded arrangements to hold a procession tagged ‘Peace Rally’ to sensitize people of the state against election violence ahead the September 22, 2018 governorship election in the state. The Executive Director of KDI, Bukola Idowu, said the rally would set out from the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park, Osogbo, on Tuesday morning and terminate at the Aurora Conference and Events Centre by noon. Idowu, who explained that the initiative enjoyed the support of the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), added that a ‘Vote, Not Fight’ peace concert by renowned hip-hop artiste, Tuface Idibia, would come up immediately after the rally. “The rally would be one of a kind in the history of the state. It is expected to host over 2000 youths from all the local government areas of Osun State. It seeks to encourage youths to shun violence and embrace peace, by signing a Non-Violence pledge,” he said. Idowu said Tuface Idibia, who he disclosed has been commissioned as the Campaign Peace Ambassador for the programme, has pledged his commitment to use his platforms for various festivals and events to further promote the campaign.
