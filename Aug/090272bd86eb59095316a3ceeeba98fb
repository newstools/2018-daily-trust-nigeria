Buba Galadima, chairman of the Reformed All progressives Congress (R-APC) has said those running from President Muhammadu Buhari were honest Nigerians.

Galadima said this at the opening of the secretariat of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) in Abuja.

CUPP is a group of political parties and groups plotting to challenge the President for his seat in 2019.

Galadima also claimed that those whose hands are soiled with corruption were the ones around the president.

“All those running to APC or with Buhari are those who have their hands soiled with corruption. They are afraid of prosecution,” he said.

“But those running away from Buhari and APC are the only honest Nigerians.”
