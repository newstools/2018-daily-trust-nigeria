Rivers State Governor Nyesom  Wike yesterday alleged that the police had declared war on the state by sabotaging electoral processes. Wike made the allegation in  a broadcast on  the suspended  Port Harcourt Constituency Three bye-election marred by violence and ballot  snatching. He said: “The consistent sabotage of the electoral process by the Police amounts to a declaration of war against the people of Rivers State and their solemn rights to freely and fairly choose their leaders and representatives. “Clearly there are dangerous times ahead but we must not give in to intimidation lest we lose our liberties and become slaves in our own land. “Against the backdrop it is up to the people of Rivers State to choose the option that will serve their interest.” Wike alleged that despite assurances of neurtrality by the State Commissioner of Police, the police joined  forces with All Progressives Congress thugs to disrupt the election. He commended the Independent National Electoral Commission for acting professionally. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Nnamdi Omoni, said the command would come out with a detailed report on the outcome of the election.
