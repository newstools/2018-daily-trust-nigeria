The FCT Primary Health Care Development Board (FCTPHCDB) has organised a Baby Show to promote breastfeeding as part of activities to celebrate the World Breastfeeding Week. The Executive Secretary, FCTPHCDB, Dr. Rilwanu Muhammad, said the week provides mothers opportunities to have robust discussions on breastfeeding. He said breast milk is Godâ€™s natural gift to women and breastfeeding provides best nutrition for babies not only for healthy growth and development but also for better survival of infants. The Secretary, FCT Health and Human Services, Amanda Pam, said there are 204 breastfeeding counsellors and coaches in the FCT health facilities and 487 infant and young child support groups in FCT communities. She urged women to breastfeed their babies without adding water or any food and drink in the first six months of life and continue breastfeeding with nutritious complementary food up to two years and beyond. Pam said breast milk provides nutrients for growth and development, with no cost implication, promotes bonding between mother and child and is easily digested.
