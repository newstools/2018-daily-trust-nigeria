The  archbishop who sparked a crisis in the Catholic Church by calling on  Pope Francis to resign has denied he was motivated by personal vendetta  and said he sought to show that corruption had reached the top levels of  the Church hierarchy. Vigano has been communicating through Aldo Maria Valli, an Italian  television journalist who Vigano consulted several times before  releasing his statement last Sunday when the pope was in Ireland. “I have never had feelings of vendetta and rancor in all these  years,” he was quoted as telling Valli, who has been publishing  statements from Vigano in his blog. “I spoke out because corruption has reached the top levels of Church  hierarchy,” said Vigano, a former Vatican ambassador to Washington. The Vatican had no comment on the new accusations by Vigano. In his statement, Vigano accused a long list of current and past  Vatican and U.S. Church officials of covering up the case of Cardinal  Theodore McCarrick, who resigned last month in disgrace. One of the people he attacks in the statement is Cardinal Tarciscio  Bertone, who was secretary of state under former Pope Benedict. Italian media reports have said Vigano was upset because Bertone had blocked any possibility of him becoming a cardinal. In his comments published on Valli’s blog, Vigano says he himself  gave up the possibility of becoming a cardinal “for the good of the  Church”. On his flight home from Ireland on Sunday, Francis told newsmen he would “not say one word” about the accusations. “Read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves,” he said. Francis’ supporters say the statement contains holes and  contradictions and note that Vigano prepared it with help from two  journalists who have been critical of Francis, citing this as evidence  that it forms part of an ideological anti-Francis strategy. The journalists deny this. (Reuters/NAN)
