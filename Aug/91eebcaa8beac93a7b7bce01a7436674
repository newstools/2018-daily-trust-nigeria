The American University of Nigeria in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have trained and empowered 1000 farmers from the four  local government areas of Michika, Maiha, Mubi- North and Mubi-South, which are the areas most affected by the insurgency. The Project Director, Abubakar Mu’azu, disclosed this during the graduation ceremony of the AUN/UNHCR Agriculture Livelihood project, which has empowered farmers with inputs. He said the beneficiaries who have been trained on bio-dynamic, compost making, mulching, processing and storage of produce were empowered with farm kits and seedlings. Mu’azu explained that 49 agricultural base cooperatives were also formed. The Director, Grants and Projects, Dr. Audu Liman, said the cooperatives were formed to encourage unity and cooperation among farmers. “Once you get your starter kits, whatever you produce as a cooperative is for your own use and any cooperative that performs well would benefit more the next time we come,” he said. A beneficiary, Dong Williams, hailed the initiative. “They came with different and well improved system of farming; we were taught the disadvantages of using chemicals on our farmlands. The idea alone and experiences we got from AUN staffs are worth appreciating and for the first time in my life, I received free fertilizer,’’ he stated.
