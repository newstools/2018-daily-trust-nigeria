Resident doctors in the Federal Capital Territory will commence indefinite strike on August 25, if the authorities don’t reverse deductions from their salaries. In a communiqué after its meeting, the National Association of Resident Doctors in the FCT called the deductions from doctors’ pay “obnoxious” and negating scientific reasoning. In the document signed by its president, Michel Olarewaju, the association said its members, who passed promotion exams since 2016 were yet to be promoted. The association said arrears from skipping were yet to be paid, even after being repeatedly told it had been figured into the budget. It said the same payments have been made out to other cadres of health workers. In addition, 28-day allowances of its members have been computed but yet to be paid.
