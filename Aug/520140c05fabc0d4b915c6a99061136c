Security has been beefed up at the Murtala Muhammed Airports, Ikeja,  ahead of the British Prime Minister, Mrs Theresa May’s visit to Lagos on  Wednesday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that security agencies  including the Police, the Nigeria Civil Defence and Security Corps and  the
Nigerian Army are at strategic locations within the precincts of the airport. Also deployed are officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps and the  Lagos State Traffic Management Agency  to ensure smooth human and  vehicular movement. An official of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) told  NAN that the facility has been secured with the deployment of the  security personnel for May’s arrival. NAN reports that Gov. Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State is expected to receive the Prime Minister and her entourage later today at
the airport. May is on a trade mission in an attempt to bolster Britain’s  post-Brexit fortunes. This is her first visit to Africa since she became  Prime
Minister in 2016. She will be accompanied by a 30-man business delegation as part of  her efforts to “deepen and strengthen” partnerships around the world
as the UK prepares to leave the European Union (EU) next year. Former Prime Minister David Cameron had in 2013 visited Africa for Nelson Mandela’s memorial service. (NAN
