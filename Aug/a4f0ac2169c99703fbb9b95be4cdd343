The Peace Corps of Nigeria (PCN) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reconsider the bill for an Act to establish the Nigerian Peace Corps. President Buhari had on Tuesday, February 27, 2018, withheld assent to the bill, citing security issues and financial constraints as reasons. But the corps, which claims it has membership of about 157,000 regular officers, 2 million volunteers and can provide jobs for about 3 million youths; said the end has not come to the bill. The corps said only President Buhari has the capacity to recall the bill after six months, for reconsideration and possible assent. National Commandant of the Corps, Dr Dickson Akoh, in a statement to mark the 2018 International Youth Day, said the day “Provides an opportunity for the government and other stakeholders in youth development to review the challenges affecting the youths”.
