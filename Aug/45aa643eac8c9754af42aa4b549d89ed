US national security chiefs have lined up to warn American democracy is in the "crosshairs" of foreign adversaries for elections in 2018 and 2020. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said: "We continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to weaken and divide the US." Mr Coats said the efforts were less robust so far than in 2016, and did not appear directed at a single party. The Kremlin denies US claims it meddled in its last presidential election. US National Security Adviser John Bolton, FBI Director Chris Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also spoke at Thursday's White House news conference. Mr Coats said Russia was not the only country that was trying to intervene in US elections, without elaborating. One reporter questioned whether US President Donald Trump had adequately challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin on the matter at their bilateral summit in Finland last month.
