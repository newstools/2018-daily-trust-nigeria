A former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday called on governors in the country to learn ways of achieving security from their Bayelsa State counterpart, Seriake Dickson. Obasanjo made the call in Yenagoa where he joined Dickson for Bayelsa’s monthly thanksgiving service. The former president said Bayelsa, which used to be dreaded for militancy had now become one ofa the safest states in the country. He said: “The peace of God is here. Bayelsa used to be dreaded for militancy and insecurity; and now, people are asking what is happening in Bayelsa State. If you are a governor and you want to do well, come to Bayelsa and learn the secret.” Obasanjo said nothing is more important than man’s relationship with God, adding that “it is obvious for all to see that the peace of God is in the state.” Dickson said despite the 2016 recession that hit the country, his administration had continued to excel in health, education, and other sectors.
