A Pan-Igbo group Ohaneze has again warned that Nigeria may not endure as an entity if political restructuring of the country is not carried out.

The Coordinator of Ohaneze Youth Wing in the South South, Chief Arthur Ugwa, gave the warning on Saturday when the group visited the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) in Yenagoa.

He argued that restructuring the nation would foster even development and ensure peaceful co-existence in all parts of the country.

“Restructuring is the only thing that will save this nation from going into extinction. Different regions must be able to manage their resources for accelerated development.

“Our leaders have been crying for restructuring over the years.  It’s incumbent on the leadership of this country to consider this option for a united Nigeria.”
