The abducted wife of the murdered Kaduna Reverend, Mrs. Talatu Akuchi has regained her freedom six days after her husband's killers abducted her. It was gathered that a ransom of N500, 000 was paid to her abductors before she was freed on Saturday night. The kidnappers had earlier demanded for a ransom of N5million but after negotiations and pleas, they accepted N500,000 before she was released. Unknown gunmen had at the wee hours of last week Monday attacked Nasara Baptist Church, Guguwa near Rigasa in Kaduna, killing Reverend Hosea who was the church pastor and abducted his wife, Mrs. Talatu Akuchi. A family source said, “Mrs. Talatu was released to us on Saturday night. She is presently taking medication in the hospital,” On whether ransom was paid or not, he said, “Yes, we paid N500,000 before we could secure her release. It is quite unfortunate that a woman who is suppose to be mourning her husband was kept in captivity for about a week by some wicked elements who killed her husband,” "Government needs to do more to ensure security of lives and properties across the country. The criminals stormed the reverend’s house, killed him, abducted his wife right before the children and collected N500,000 before releasing her and the security agencies could not do anything throughout the process. It is very painful but we believe God will judge every one of us according to our deeds,” the source said. When contacted, the Kaduna State Police Command spokesperson, DSP Yakubu Sabo confirmed that Mrs. Talatu has been released unhurt but said the police is not aware whether ransom was paid or not.
