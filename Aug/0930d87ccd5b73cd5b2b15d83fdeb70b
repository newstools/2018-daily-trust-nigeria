Troops of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS) were Saturday engaged in a heavy gun duel with armed militia believed to be herders in Guma Local Government Area of Benue State.

Daily Trust gathered that the soldiers were on patrol of the area along Gbajimba-Iyordye- Akaahena communities in Guma when the gunmen ambushed them and allegedly killed one of the troop while two others were injured.

But the Force Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke, Major General Adeyemi Mutiu Yekini, said he couldn't confirm any casualties at the time of sending this report because his men were yet in the field.

"Yes, troops encountered herdsmen. But, right now, (5:10pm), they are still in the bush so I can't say if there are any causality until they come back," he said.

Yekini who spoke to our correspondent by telephone assured that he would expatiate on the matter at a later time when he gets all the details of the fresh hostility against his troop.

The OPWS had on July 3, 2018 confirmed the killing of two soldiers and injuring of five others while they carried out cordon and search operations at Barkin Kota village in Keana local government area of Nasarawa state by suspected herdsmen during a gun duel.
