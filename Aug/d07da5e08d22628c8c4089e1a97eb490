The Presidency yesterday said it was awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the Department of State Service (DSS) on an audio clip of Leah Sharibu of the Government Girls’ Science and Technical College (GGSTC), Dapchi, Yobe state. Recall that Boko Haram had on February 19, this year abducted 110 students of the GGSTC in their school. Sharibu was held back by the sect reportedly on an account of her faith when her colleagues were released through negotiation. Yesterday, an audio clip of Sharibu was published by The Cable. “I am Leah Sharibu, the girl that was abducted in GGSS Dapchi. I am calling on the government and people of goodwill to intervene to get me out of my current situation. “I also plead to the members of the public to help my mother, my father, my younger brother and relatives. Kindly help me out of my predicament. I am begging you to treat me with compassion, I am calling on the government, particularly, the president to pity me and get me out of this serious situation. Thank you,” she said in Hausa. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu said on his Twitter handle said: “We are aware of the audio in circulation concerning the unfortunate situation of our daughter, Leah Sharibu. In dealing with terrorists, nothing is too trivial. “The secret service is analyzing the voice. Our reaction will follow the outcome of the investigation. For President Buhari, nothing will be spared in bringing all our girls home,” he said.
