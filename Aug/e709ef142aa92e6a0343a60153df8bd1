The chairman of Kwali Area Council, Mr. Joseph K. Shazin, has said that his constituents insisted that he contests for the ticket of Abuja South Constituency for the House of Representatives in 2019. Shazin stated this shortly after he formally declared his intention to run for the Abuja South Federal Constituency seat on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said it took him almost two years to accept the call to contest for the seat, adding that he consulted relevant stakeholders and party stalwarts before declaring his intention. He said if given the chance to represent the people of Abuja South, he would make a difference by addressing major challenges facing them. He called on his supporters not to allow themselves to be used as thugs in the coming election. The Kwali APC chairman, Alhaji Yahaya Aliyu Sheda, assured that the party would give him necessary support to realise his ambition in 2019. The occasion also witnessed the inauguration of the partyâ€™s ward executives by the council chairman.
