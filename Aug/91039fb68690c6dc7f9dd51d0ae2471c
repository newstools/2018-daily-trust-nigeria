Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola has begun payment of full salaries to all categories of civil servants in the state. This is coming barely five weeks to the governorship election in the state. The government, in 2015, introduced the modulated salary system in which only workers on level seven and below were being full paid with those on level eight and above getting 75 and 50 percent of their salaries. Some workers in the state who spoke with our correspondent in Osogbo, the state capital, confirmed yesterday that their July salary was fully paid this week. The chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in the state, Jabob Adekomi, in a chat with Daily Trust, commended the governor for his commitment to workersâ€™ welfare. A senior civil servant in the state, Pastor James Oloyede, confirmed that he had received his July salary in full.
