The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has said its fighter jets destroyed Boko Haram terroristsâ€™ hideouts near Arra in Borno, State. Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola in a statement on Monday, said the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole, between 10 and 18 August 2018, conducted massive day and night attacks against remnants of Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) and their facilities. He said the attacks, which were preceded by days of intensive Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, were planned and executed based on credible intelligence indicating that the BHTs were making moves to regroup around the fringes of Sambisa.  He said the first air strike was a daytime mission executed on 10 August 2018 at a location 4.5 Km Northwest of Arra around the fringes of Sambisa, where ISR had confirmed that BHTs were regrouping to launch attacks against troops in the general area. Daramola said the ATF detailed an Alpha Jet to attack the location, overhead the area of interest, the Alpha Jet acquired and engaged targets, destroying parts of the settlement and neutralizing several BHTs. He added that Intelligence reports later revealed that some of the surviving BHTs had converged at another location 4.8Km West of Arra. He said the ATF deployed Mi-35M helicopter gunships for a night attack on the new location on 18 August 2018, resulting in the death of dozens of BHTs.
