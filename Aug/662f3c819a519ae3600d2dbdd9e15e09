The Buhari Support Organization yesterday dismissed the allegation of marginalization in terms of federal appointments and projects by Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal. Addressing journalists in Sokoto, the state’s coordinator of the BSO, FodioUmar Bello, said Buhari had done a lot for the state with thegovernor’s local government having the largest shares of thoseprojects and appointments. He asked Tambuwal to account for the N18.3 billion Paris clubrefund, the allocation from the federation account, among others. According to him, the Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Aishat Abubakar and The Director General, Nigerian Automotive Design and Development Council, Jelani Aliyu, are from the same area with Tambuwal. “Our intention is not to join words with the governor but to debunk the allegation of marginalization because his statement portrays blackmail and misinterpretation of facts capable of not only misleading the public but undermining the tremendous efforts the President is making in the service for the great people of this state as part of his larger Nigerian constituency,” he said.
