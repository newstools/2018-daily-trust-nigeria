The Indonesian island of Lombok has been shaken by two strong earthquakes, after weeks of tremors that have killed hundreds of people. A magnitude 6.3 quake killed one person and wrecked homes near the town of Belanting on Sunday. It was felt in the east of the island, triggering landslides and sending people fleeing into the streets. Officials later reported a 7.0 tremor in the same area. There is no word on any casualties in that quake. The biggest quake in recent weeks - of 6.9 magnitude - killed more than 460 people on 5 August. It levelled homes, mosques and businesses, displacing hundreds of thousands, including many tourists.
