Director General of the Federal Capital Territory Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Idris Abbas, has said the agency has made plans to receive 8,828 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Nasarawa and Kogi states. Abbas, who stated this on Tuesday during a stakeholdersâ€™ meeting, said the IDPs were victims of recent communal clashes in the two states, adding that they would be sheltered at Government Secondary School (GSS) Dangara, Kwali Area Council. He said the FCT was involved because of the need to provide a proper camp for the displaced persons who were earlier taking refuge at different locations in Kwali and Abaji. He said the plan to accommodate the displaced persons at GSS Dangara was temporary, pending school resumption, adding that they would be moved to their communities when the state governments completed their peace efforts and camping arrangements. A recent communal clash broke out between the Egbura and Bassa ethnic groups in some parts of Nasarawa and Kogi states which led to loss of lives and property and displaced some people.
