 The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has said its Air Task Force (ATF) on Operation Lafiya Dole neutralized Boko Haram Terrorists (BHT) camps at Zanari and Tunbun Rego in Borno State. Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola in a statement on Tuesday said the air strikes on the BHT locations around the fringes of the Lake Chad occurred on 20 August 2018. He said the air strikes at Zanari were planned and executed based on intelligence reports indicating that the BHTs had established a training camp in the village and were converging in an area prior to departing for an attack on troops locations around the Lake Chad area. He added that the ATF scrambled two Alpha Jet aircraft for a pre-emptive strike on two specified locations within Zanari, where the BHTs were assembled. “The fighter aircraft acquired and attacked both locations, neutralizing several BHTs, with only few survivors seen fleeing the area,” he said. He said, “These were later mopped up by follow-on rocket strikes. Similarly, another identified BHT rendezvous point and staging area on the outskirts of Tunbun Rego was also attacked and destroyed by the Alpha Jets. “ He said the NAF will continue to deploy its platforms to conduct intensive Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in the entire Northeast aimed at discovering the possible locations of remnants of BHTs and neutralizing them.
