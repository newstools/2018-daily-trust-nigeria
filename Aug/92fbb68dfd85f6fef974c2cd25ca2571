A former governor of Kano State, Sen Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, is set to declare his ambition to run for the office of president in the 2019 general elections on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) tomorrow (Wednesday). According to a statement made available to Daily Trust yesterday by his Presidential Campaign Committee, Kwankwaso would declare at the Eagle Square in Abuja. After his declaration, Kwankwaso would slug it out at the primaries with over 10 other aspirants seeking the same ticket on the platform of the party. The statement said the former Minister of Defence and member of the House of Representatives in the Third Republic would embark on massive infrastructure development across the country, tackle the security challenges bedeviling the nation and protect the future of the country if given the mandate. “It is imperative for us to embark on massive infrastructural turnaround across the country with judicious management of the nation’s resources without necessarily mortgaging the future of the country on excessive foreign loans and its attendant burden,” the statement read. The committee said high profile personalities both home and abroad are expected at the occasion.
