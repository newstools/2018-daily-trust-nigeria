The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) have commenced a process of partnership to strengthen the provision of quick and appropriate emergency medical assistance to disaster victims in the country. A Bilateral Technical Working Group (BTWG) has already been established between NEMA and the NMA to draw up details of the working relationship, NEMA’s Head of media and Public Relations, Sani Datti said in a statement yesterday. He said the Director General of NEMA Engr Mustapha Maihaja, who led management staff of the agency to meet the national executives of the NMA in Abuja at the weekend, identified the imperatives for the partnership to actively engage members of the association in addressing gaps in the provision of medical supports in the aftermath of disaster incidents. Maihaja said though there were a number of medical personnel in NEMA, response to disaster situations would always require more professionals “to guide and direct us appropriately.” Maihaja said partnership with the NMA would avail the services of specialists in various medical fields to deal with situations such as malnutrition among Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), deployment of First Aid by emergency workers and advocacy against environmental health issues among others. For his part, national executives of the association led by the President, Dr. Francis Adedayo said the partnership would enable them offer more services to the less privileged and those in distressed.
