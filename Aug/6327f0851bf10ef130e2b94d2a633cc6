The Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND) has organised a two-day capacity building workshop for women farmers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The empowerment programme, which drew rural women farmers from the six area councils, was aimed at ensuring that they make profit in their businesses. A consultant at the workshop, Prof Aderibigbe Olomola, said agriculture is in the hands of small business owners who are largely women that have small farms that are, however undercapitalised. “They need to be empowered by getting the right skills in doing the agricultural business and to know how to manage loan facilities effectively and efficiently so that they can generate expected returns and run profitable enterprises,” he said. He said the capacity of the women would be built in loan management, agricultural entrepreneurship, sales promotion and marketing as well as record keeping. One of the resource persons and an official of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Fawale Olabimpe, said the workshop would boost the farmers’ entrepreneurial capacity. “There are many things most of the small business owners are not doing well but at the end of the day they will tell you that it’s because they lack finance but even when you have all the money, you should be able to identify what you want to do with the money,” she said, adding that the gaps would be bridged at the end of the workshop. One of the participants, Wakilat Okeji, commended the group for the initiative. “As a poultry farmer, I have not broken even since I have been doing the business. I want to see a way where I can get it right and do the right thing to make sure my products sell profitably,” she said.
