A political party, Sustainable National Party, (SNP) has assured Nigerians that if it is voted into power, it would resuscitate and restructure the country to be a better place for everyone. Speaking yesterday during its maiden national convention in Abuja, chairman of the party, Mr. Kayode Arimoro, said it was time for Nigerians to join hands with a party “that is coming from the grassroots to restore Nigeria’s lost glory. He encouraged citizens that politics was not for charlatans but for people with sound minds who have proper ideas to make a greater nation, hence they should come out with their good ideas and get involved in politics. Arimoro said the party was ready to encourage people with integrity and great ideas to contest under its platform for all political offices, hence it has reduced the fees for nomination forms to make them affordable. He said the party also encourages women participation in politics and would support any woman who indicates interest in any political office. He said the party was not in for a quick fix but wanted to have a sustainable solution to the issues in the country. “That is why we are not forming any coalition with any political party at the moment, instead we are forming coalitions with only people-oriented movements.” He called on people not to sell their votes to any political party, else they would keep mortgaging the future of the upcoming generations.
