The General Overseer of El-Shaddai Evangelical Fire and Word Ministries International, Pastor Kolawole Olusegun, called on Federal Capital Territory residents to ensure they register and collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs). Pastor Olusegun said residents should take advantage of the extension by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be able to exercise their franchise. Pastor Olusegun, who made this call while speaking with journalists at the one year anniversary of the church, said that only when the people got registered would they be able to make their choices during the general elections. “Everyone should register and be ready to vote in the right choice. There are many devices in a man’s heart, but it is only the counsel of El-Shaddai that shall stand,” he said The cleric also called on Nigerians not to lose faith in God because of the present economic situation of the country; but rather connect to God, saying that anybody who connected to Jehovah El-Shaddai would always survive the economic situation of the country.
