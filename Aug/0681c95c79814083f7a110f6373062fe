Yobe State Commissioner for Health Muhammad Bello Kawuwa says exclusive breastfeeding  has remained dangerously low in the state. Kawuwa disclosed this yesterday in Damaturu at a press briefing to commemorate the 2018 world breastfeeding week. “It’s disheartening that even among the poor mothers, in urban and rural areas, there is belief that infant formula is what they should be giving to their children,” he said. He noted that the barrier, which was brought by certain myths and beliefs should be defused using parents, traditional rulers and other gatekeepers in the society because, no artificial milk can possibly equal the breastmilk. “Essential vitamins, amino acids and antibiotics that are naturally present in a mother’s breast milk help to reduce the occurrence of ear and respiratory infection, diarrhea and meningitis, and are also credited with helping to protect children against allergies,  asthma,  obesity and sudden infant death sndrome,” he explained. “So, it is without doubt that breastmilk is the ‘gold standard’ when it comes to infant nutrition. Thus,  it’s the foundation for life” the commissioner said.
