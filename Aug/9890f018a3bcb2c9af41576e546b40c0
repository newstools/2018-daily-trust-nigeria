Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), called on followers to keep fighting in his first purported message in a year. In an audio recording released by ISIL’s media outlet al-Furqan Foundation on Wednesday, Baghdadi referred to events that took place this month in the Middle East and elsewhere, including Turkey’s dispute with the United States over its detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. The recording’s authenticity could not be verified, but experts said the voice resembled that heard in other messages. The audio was titled Give Glad Tidings to the Patient.
