The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) says the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya  Dole  has conducted a successful attack on a Boko Haram terrorists’ hideout in Daban Masara in Borno State. Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, who disclosed this in a statement yesterday in Abuja, said that the operation was carried out on Friday. “The surgical air strikes were conducted on the strength of credible intelligence which indicated that remnants of BHTs on the Lake Chad Islands were hiding out in settlements at the Southern part of the lake, including Daban Masara, and were amassing in some buildings for a meeting. “An air interdiction mission was therefore planned and executed to destroy two out of the green roofed buildings within Daban Masara that were identified as BHT rendezvous points. “Upon receiving the intelligence, the ATF dispatched a NAF Alpha Jet aircraft, along with an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform, to attack the two buildings, where the BHTs were gathered, with bombs. “Overhead the area of interest, the Alpha Jet successfully released its bombs on the targets in successive strikes, leading to massive destruction of the targeted buildings as well as the neutralisation of several BHTs,” he said.(NAN)
