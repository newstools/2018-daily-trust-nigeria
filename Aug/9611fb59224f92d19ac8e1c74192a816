First batch of Nigerian pilgrims that attended the 2018 Hajj in Saudi Arabia will return to the country today. The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) announced this yesterday during its post-Arafat meeting in Makkah. The NAHCON chairman/chief executive Abdullahi Mukhtar Muhammad said the pilgrims will be ferried back home on first- in, first -out basis. The 446 Kogi State pilgrims are scheduled to make the first flight back to Nigeria. The pilgrims will depart the King Abdulazeez International Airport Jeddah early this morning and arrive Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja in the afternoon today. The Kogi pilgrims were the first batch to be airlifted to Saudi Arabia during the inaugural on July 21, 2018. NAHCON said the three approved air carriers - Max Air, Medview, and Flynas- will commence return journey today. Muhammad also pleaded for pilgrims and stakeholders during the return journey. He said serious coordination is needed among Hajj stakeholders “because during the inbound journey, Nigerian pilgrims used 15 departure centers in Nigeria. But in the return journey, we are going to use only one exit point together with over 80 other countries.” He also said pilgrims should comply with the official luggage policy of eight kilogram hand luggage and 32 kilogram main luggage to avoid causing delay.
