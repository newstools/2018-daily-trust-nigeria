Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has commiserated with Senator Smart Adeyemi over the death of his wife, Yemisi, describing the incident as sad and shocking. In a statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Petra Akinti Onyegbule, the Governor sent his condolences to the Senator, children and family of the deceased and prayed for God to console them over the bereavement which the Governor notes would be deeply felt by the family and everyone who knew the deceased. While praying to God to grant eternal repose to the soul of the late Mrs. Adeyemi, Governor Bello enjoined Senator Smart in the words of the Bible to “not grieve like those without hope” stressing that as a believer, the Senator should be consoled by the knowledge that his beloved wife and partner of many years has only gone before him to rest and they shall meet again on the "Resurrection Morning". Governor Bello equally extended his condolence to the people of Kogi West Senatorial District and all other persons affected by the death of Mrs. Adeyemi. Daily Trust reports that Mrs Yemisi died on Saturday in Abuja.
