Senate President Bukola Saraki should make up his mind and contest the 2019 presidential election because he possesses the needed capacity to reunite the country, a second republic lawmaker, Dr Abdullah Umar Madidi, has said. The former lawmaker said Saraki’s track record -both in private and public service, remain not only exemplary but indeed legendary. “From his sojourn in the private sector, to his experience as a commissioner and then governor of Kwara State, and subsequently the Senate President, Bukola Saraki is in a world of his own and hence the most qualified at the moment to fly the opposition's flag in the Presidential election next year. “He is also an easily sellable candidate. He is a Northerner with a humongous and unprecedented support-base in the different parts of the country. There is no better candidate that can pull the magic wand needed to oust President Muhammadu Buhari's led APC government out of office,” Madidi said. He said he was particularly in support of Saraki who can be likened to a political genius whose emergence from the North central geo-political region would be the binding spirit and cohesion that is needed by the nation at this crucial time. Madidi called on Nigerians to avoid politics of mediocrity. He urged them to be nationalistic in the quest to usher in a new dispensation in 2019, stressing that accountability, justice, rule of law and devotion to service must be regarded as unnegotiable yardsticks that the next Nigerian President will not only be seen to imbibe but also radiate.
