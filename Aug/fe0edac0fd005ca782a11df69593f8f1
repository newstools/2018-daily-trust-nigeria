The Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has called on Nigerian youths to shun violence. The president of the CBCN, His Grace, Rev. Augustine Akubeze made the call in Calabar yesterday at the opening of the 2018 National Youth Day. He also cautioned politicians arming the youths to unleash mayhem on the country to fear God. â€œWhy would young people allow themselves to be used to cause mayhem against political opponents only to be dumbed at the end of the hatchet job? The Archbishop prayed for the socio- economic wellbeing of Nigeria and also urged those in authority to shun impunity and end senseless killings in parts of the country.
