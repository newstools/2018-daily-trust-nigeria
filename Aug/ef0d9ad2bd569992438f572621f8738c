Chief Chyna Iwuanyanwu, a former aspirant for the position of National Chairman (2015) and National Publicity Secretary (2012) of the PDP died last week after battling a terminal illness for several years, the widow of the deceased, Mrs. Joy Iwuanyanwu, has said. Mrs. Iwuanyanwu, who spoke with journalists in Abuja on Monday, voiced her joy that her late husband battled the illness to the last minute. She said the late former journalist with Radio Nigeria and Champion newspaper would be missed for everything. “What will I say? It was very painful and traumatic when I knew he was going. He was a strong man who battled his illness to the last minute. He fought to the last before surrendering to the cold hands of death. “The only consolation is that I am feeling satisfied with the kind of life he lived. He lived a fulfilled life. I thought he would have lived longer than this. “If there is anything I will miss most in him, it should be his love, his caring for me, his children and grandchildren. I will equally miss his sense of humour. He was really a very good man and I will certainly miss everything about him. “One outstanding legacy he left behind was his truthful life. He was a very truthful person. He was a humanitarian. “He also left behind love for God. In the political scene, which I know that he loved to a fault, he was one man who believed in politics without bitterness. He hated cheating so much and was ready to sacrifice his life to ensure that the masses were not cheated. “However, in all his love for politics, it never came between me and him. I usually urged him to stay out of politics and stop protesting the injustice in politics, but he had always insisted he must talk and speak against the injustices meted on the downtrodden. He would always tell me that he hated people that refused to do what they were supposed to do,” she said.
