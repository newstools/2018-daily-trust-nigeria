Preliminary investigations in the runup to setting up the committee have already led to the arrest of five people, including the importer of both consignments seized. Ali urged the committee for a painstaking investigation be conducted to unravel all those “remotely connected to the criminal importation with a view to punishing offenders and preventing re-occurrence”.
