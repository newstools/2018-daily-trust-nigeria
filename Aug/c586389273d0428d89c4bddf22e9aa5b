The Agricultural and Rural Development Secretariat (ARDS) of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), has flagged off the registration of poultry farms, feed mills and other related agricultural businesses in the territory. Speaking at the event, the ARDS secretary, Stanley Ifeanyichukwu Nweze, said the exercise was meant to build a database of the businesses in the territory. He said the exercise would help the administration to identify and organise farmers for ease of accessibility and better service delivery, adding that it will also help to link the farmers with possible credit facilities and marketers. According to him, farmers and marketers as well as consumers would get information on the location and availability of quality poultry products which, he said, will assist them in the procurement of high quality inputs. The president of Poultry Farmers Association of Nigeria, Ibrahim Lamidi, in his remarks, commended the FCTA for the initiative, through collaboration with the FCT chapter of the association. He urged farmers in the territory to intensify efforts towards embracing the exercise.
