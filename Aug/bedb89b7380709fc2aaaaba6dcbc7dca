Investigators of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday quizzed a former Director General of the Directorate of State Services (DSS) Ita Ekpenyong for the second day after his arrest. Ekpenyong was arrested Thursday and was allowed to go home same day on the condition that he would always make himself available to EFCC investigators. Daily Trust Saturday gathered that he made himself available yesterday to answer more questions over alleged financial malfeasance whilst he led the security agency. EFCC picked Ekpenyong from his Asokoro residence in Abuja to answer questions over the utilization of N20 billion he allegedly received from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
