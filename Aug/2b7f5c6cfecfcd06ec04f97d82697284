Ten councillors in Gwagwalada Area Council have joined a Buhari Support Group, Grassroots Mobilisers for Buhari (GMB). The speaker of the council, Mr. Caleb Yakubu, who led his colleagues to pick the groupâ€™s nomination in Abuja, said they were impressed with the activities of the support group. He said their desire to join the group was informed by the achievements of the President Buhari administration in the last three years through tackling of corruption, running the economy well and building infrastructure across the country. According to him, the 10 wards were closer to the people at the grassroots, saying joining the group would enable them reach out to the people at the grassroots in order to mobilise them to support President Muhammadu Buhari at the polls in 2019. The national chairperson of the Grassroots Mobilisers for Buhari (GMB), Dr. Fatima Mohammed Goni, who received the councillors in her office, said she was disturbed that many people across the six area councils were yet to collect their PVCs. She urged the councillors to mobilise residents to ensure that they collected their cards.
