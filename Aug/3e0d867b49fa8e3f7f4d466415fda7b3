Some residents of the FCT have benefitted from free medical services offered by Deda Hospital, Abuja. One of the beneficiaries and mother of quadruplets, Mrs Oluwatoyin Odebunmi Abimbola, commended the management of the hospital for the free medical services, saying she and her quadruplets have benefitted from the services. “I was delivered of quadruplets in January and I came with them today because they are six months old. They gave them immunisation free. Also, because I had the babies through C-section, I had check-up and injections free,” she said. The Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Dr Onuh Sunday Omale, said at the event that giving free services was the hospital’s contribution to the society. “We had free consultations and offered free medical tests for issues like malaria and blood sugar test because diabetes is a silent killer. We also did blood pressure test. We are also working on discounted IVF because that is where people have needs,” he said.
