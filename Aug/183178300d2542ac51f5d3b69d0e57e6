A resident of Elekuro, Ibadan, Suleiman Rufai, has expressed his displeasure with the suit instituted by his wife, Kafayat, seeking the dissolution of their 17-year-old marriage. Rufai told a customary court at Oja Oba, Ibadan, on Tuesday that he still loved Kafayat despite the sexual affairs she had with two Islamic spiritualists when he travelled on official assignments. He said he had appealed to his wife to rethink her decision to walk away from their marriage but she was adamant. Narrating the genesis of Kafayat’s resolve to divorce him, the respondent said she had been experiencing difficulty in conceiving as she was having her menstrual circle twice a month, but he had assured her of his help to find a solution to the problem. Rufai said he was shocked to learn that his wife, in her desperate search for pregnancy, consulted a spiritualist with whom she had sex. He added that when he confronted her on the issue, she initially denied the act but later confessed to doing it. “I forgave her but she did it again with another alfa when she went out again to seek spiritual help for not conceiving 16 years after she gave birth to the first child,” he said. Kafayat had alleged in her divorce petition that her husband was irresponsible and that one of her friends had informed her on their wedding day that he had already impregnated another lady, which was later confirmed to her. She said when she reported him to his family members that he had already impregnated a lady, none of them showed any sympathy for her. She said it was true she sought for solution from an Islamic spiritualist when her husband did not show enough concern about her plight. Kafayat added that her husband never cared for the child in the marriage, saying she was the only one caring for his education and feeding. The president of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade, dissolved the marriage and granted the custody of the child to the defendant.
