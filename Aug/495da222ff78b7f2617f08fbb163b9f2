Nigeria’s senate president, Dr Bukola Saraki says his defection to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was not based on clinching an automatic ticket from the party. Saraki was reacting to allegations raised by national leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on why he and others defected to the PDP. Saraki described Tinubu’s claims as falsehoods adding that democracy is a system that allows people to freely make their choices. “It is a surprise to me that Asiwaju Tinubu is still peddling the falsehood about the fact that my defection is about automatic ticket and sharing of resources. Members of the public will recall that when the issue of my decision to quit APC came to the fore and many APC leaders were holding meetings with me, a newspaper owned by the same Tinubu published a false report about the promise of automatic tickets, oil blocks and other benefits. I immediately rebutted their claims and categorically stated that I never discussed any such personal and pecuniary benefits with anybody. My challenge that anybody who has contrary facts should come forward with them still remains open. It should be known that Democracy is a system that allows people to freely make their choices. It is my choice that I have decided to join others to present a viable alternative platform for Nigerians in the coming elections. Tinubu and leaders of the APC had better respect this decision or lawfully deal with it. As for me, Allah gives power to whom He wishes. Human beings can only aspire and strive to fulfill their aspirations,” he said.
