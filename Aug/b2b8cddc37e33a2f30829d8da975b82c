Zimbabwean police are searching for nine senior officials of the opposition MDC Alliance following disputed elections, media reports say. They are wanted for allegedly inciting their supporters to stage an illegal protest last Wednesday. Six people were killed after the military intervened to curb the protests in the capital, Harare. The MDC Alliance says last Monday’s election was rigged to give President Emmerson Mnangagwa victory. The electoral commission insists there was “absolutely no skulduggery”. Former finance minister and leading MDC Alliance figure Tendai Biti is among those wanted. His arrest warrant, seen by the BBC, says that Mr Biti “unlawfully” announced that his party’s leader, Nelson Chamisa, won the presidential election.
