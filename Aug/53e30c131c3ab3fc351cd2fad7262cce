There was a gale of defection at the hometown of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal where over 10,000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), including his political godfather, Alhaji Abubakar Shehu Tambuwal joined the All Progressives Congress (APC). About 10,000 of the defectors were said to be the governor's kinsmen and others from the six local government areas that constituted Sokoto South Senatorial District. The defectors were received by the state chairman of APC, Alhaji Isa Achida at Tambuwal town. Speaking on why he decided to dump PDP for APC, Abubakar Shehu Tambuwal said it was because of the domineering tendency of the leader of the party in the state and former Governor, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa and the recent defection of Governor Tambuwal to the party. Tambuwal described his erstwhile political godson as ‘opportunist’ who has been riding on the back of prominent politicians only to dump them after winning election. Shehu recalled how he helped the Governor get the ticket to contest for Kebbe/Tambuwal federal constituency in 2003 only for him to dump them and joined former Governor Wamakko in 2007 who he now dumped now and joined Bafarawa. "I cannot sit under one party with an opportunist," he said On the rumoured presidential ambition of the Governor, Shehu wondered if the Governor could deliver even his polling unit to PDP. "What! to become the president! The president of Governor Wike ko? I can assure you that Tambuwal cannot deliver even his polling unit to PDP because he lost that credibility in this area," he said. Also speaking, the chairman of APC in the area, Umar Maitafsir, said they have benefitted nothing from the current government in the state, adding that even the road projects awarded recently in the area was a ‘deceit’.
