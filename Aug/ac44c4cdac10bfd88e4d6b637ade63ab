A public inquiry in South Africa has started investigating alleged corruption by ex-President Jacob Zuma. The inquiry is looking into “state capture”, where the wealthy Gupta family is accused of trying to influence political decisions, including the naming of ministers. Accusations of graft dogged Mr Zuma’s presidency before he was forced to step down in February. The former president and the Gupta family deny any wrongdoing. Opening the inquiry, commission head Deputy Chief Justice Ray Zondo appealed for South Africans to share what they know. Mr Zuma was ordered to set up the commission by the high court last December following a report by the public protector, South Africa’s anti-graft body.
