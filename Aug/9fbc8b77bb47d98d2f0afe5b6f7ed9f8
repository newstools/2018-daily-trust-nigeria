The Federal Government says its whistle-blowing policy helped it generate N13.8 billion from tax evaders. Another N7.8 billion, $378 million and £27,800 were recovered from public officials, according to information minister Lai Mohammed. “The fight against corruption has been unrelenting, without fear or favour. The administration has driven corruption under the table,” he said at his country home of Oro, Kwara He said Nigerians no longer celebrate the corrupt and looters no longer sleep at night, as the long arm of the law closes in on them. “This administration has embarked on institutional reforms to curb corruption. The diligent implementation of the Treasury Singles Account (TSA) has plugged the loopholes being exploited to steal public funds.” Mohammed urged Nigerians to be vigilant and not to yield the space to naysayers. Adding that “gains of the past three years plus must be preserved Nigeria must continue on its present trajectory to sustainable growth and development. Never again must we go back to Egypt. “The year 2019 is the year of decision for Nigeria. It is the year that the critical decision will be made as to whether Nigeria will continue along the path of development, in all ramifications (social, economic, political, etc), that this administration has embarked upon since 2015, or the country will retrogress and backslide to the throes of massive and primitive looting and lack of development.
