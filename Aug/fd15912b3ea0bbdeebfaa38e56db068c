The Indigenous People of Biafra yesterday met with Ohanaeze Ndigbo, demanding its unconditional “de-proscription” as a terrorist organization. The IPOB also demanded an end to prosecutions of its members arrested in various parts of the country over their agitation for self-determination. It also demanded compensation for all its members killed during the last Operation Python Dance in the southeast as well as prosecution of security men involved. Prof. Ben Nwabueze, in whose residence at Atani in Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra State the meeting took place, said Igbo leaders of thought and the Ohanaeze leadership agreed to do all within their power to ensure that the IPOB was de-proscribed. He said that would guarantee peace in the country. Nwabueze also stated that Ndigbo was not interested in producing a president for the country in its present political structure. He said that it would be difficult for such a president from Igbo extraction or any other ethnic group in Nigeria to function effectively, hence the need for quick restructuring of the country to avoid total collapse. He said the meeting affirmed the need for rotation of the office of the president as it would give a sense of belonging to all the geo-political zones.
