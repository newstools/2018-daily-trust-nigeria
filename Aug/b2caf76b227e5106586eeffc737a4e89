A relation of Bunmi Ojo, who was assassinated last Friday in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti-State capital by some gunmen, has disclosed that Ojo’s killers seized his three mobile sets and car key before raining bullets on him. The relation, who pleaded not to be mentioned, said the assassins, however, dropped the key after the killing. The late Ojo was a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and is former Personal Assistant to ex-governor of Ekiti State, Segun Oni. The deceased, who was on the board of the Federal Character Commission as a Commissioner, was shot in the head and stomach by the gunmen. The relation said, “When they stormed the viewing centre, they shot into the air to disperse viewers and immediately seized Ojo’s mobile sets and car key before shooting. But they returned the car key after carrying out the act. What they wanted to do was cause distraction and make the murder looked like a robbery,” he said. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr Caleb Ikechukwu, told journalists yesterday the police were yet to arrest any suspect.
