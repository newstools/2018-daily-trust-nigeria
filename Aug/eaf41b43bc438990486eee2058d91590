The Northern Leaders and Stakeholders Assembly (NLSA) have described the siege by security forces at the National Assembly as destructive act against the nation’s democracy. The assembly in a statement yesterday by its Secretary, Dr Umar Ardo called on the National Assembly to probe the executive arm of government and if possible apply disciplinary measures in line with the provisions of the Constitution. “The siege on the National Assembly this morning (yesterday) for whatever reason in a gestapo-like manner by the Nigerian security forces is perhaps the worst form of impunity our country has witnessed in recent history. “Nigeria’s democracy was restored and nurtured since 1999 on the sweat and blood of patriots after it was toppled by General Buhari himself in 1983. “Nigerians cannot therefore seat back and watch all that have been built for nearly two decades destroyed again by headless power mongers on account of their insatiable selfish interests,” the statement read in part. The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan called on the National Assembly to “pull the full weight of all legislative instruments against President Muhammadu Buhari.” The party said, “President Buhari has crossed the line by placing our democracy in jeopardy, thus setting our nation on the path of anarchy.” Similarly, the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) in a statement by its spokesman, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere described the invasion as unlawful and undemocratic. Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar in a statement yesterday by his Media Office, called for an independent judicial panel of inquiry, to investigate the incidence at the National Assembly. Atiku however, commended Acting President Yemi Osinbajo for sacking the DSS Director General, Lawal Daura.
