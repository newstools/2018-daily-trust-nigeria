The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will today conduct four by-elections to fill vacancies in Katsina North and Bauchi South senatorial districts in Kastina and Bauch States; as well as Lokoja/Kogi/Koton Karfe Federal Constituency in Kogi State and Obudu Constituency in Cross River State. Four governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) were in Bauchi yesterday to support the party’s candidate, Lawal Yahaya Gumau, to win the Bauchi South senatorial district by-election. The governor of Zamfara State, who is also the Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Abdullazeez Yari, led the other Governors who participated in the final campaign for the candidate. The other governors were Simon Lalong of Plateau, Atiku Bagudu, Kebbi, and Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State. Governor Yari said: “Our message is simple, the Acting President is worried about what is going on in Bauchi State. He told us to tell you that it will be a shameful and disgraceful thing to us in the northern part of the Nigeria, with all the love being shown to Buhari in Bauchi State, for him to raise the hand of someone and endorse him, and he loses that election.” APC candidate, Lawal Yahaya Gumau, said that he wanted to move to the Senate from the House of Representatives to protect the interest of President Buhari, his constituency, and the nation. He is currently representing Toro Federal Constituency. Meanwhile, a total of 125,770 registered voters in Lokoja and 48,611 in Kogi local government areas were expected to take part in the by-election for Lokoja/Kogi federal constituency.
