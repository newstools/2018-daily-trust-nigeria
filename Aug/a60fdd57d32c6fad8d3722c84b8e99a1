The Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ibrahim Idris has been served with a warrant of criminal summons against Senate President Bukola Saraki over the Offa robbery incident. In the letter served to the IGP by Barrister Oluwatosin Ojaomo, a copy of which was sent to Daily Trust, the IGP was requested to immediately execute the service of the criminal summons on the Senate President in line with Section 122 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015. The warrant was issued on July 31 by a Grade One Area Court, ACO Estate, Lugbe, Abuja in a case with number: CR/196/18 between Ojaomo and Bukola Saraki. The lawyer accused Saraki, who failed to honour the IGP’s invitation on July 24, 2018, of “Obstructing a criminal investigation and disobeying a public officer carrying out a lawful responsibility” which he said is an offence under sections 136 and 149 of the Penal Code. The case has been fixed for September 10. The Nigeria Police had invited Saraki to make explanations after some suspects in the Offa armed robbery in April, fingered him and Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed as sponsors.
