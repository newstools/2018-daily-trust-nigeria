Presidential spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina said those who rupture the peace in different parts of the country will not have the last laugh. Adesina while receiving members of Junior Chamber International (JCI), Ikoyi, and Orji Kalu Foundation, who came to the Presidential Villa, Abuja yesterday, said those working against peace in the country won’t succeed. “For those working against peace in our country, I have news for them. They will never win. Nigeria will have peace, and if the evildoers don’t settle for peace, that peace will be attained without them. Whether they like it or not, peace will return to Nigeria, despite the difficult times we are passing through now,” he said. Adesina who was quoted in a statement by Deputy Director, State House Media Department, Abiodun Oladunjoye, commended the peace marchers for their initiative, noting that the quest for peace was very dear to the heart of the President. At the event, Demian Igbokwe read a speech on behalf of Chief Orji Kalu, former governor of Abia State and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, who was one of the brains behind the Peace Walk. Under the title ‘Peace is Possible in Nigeria,’ Kalu lamented that the country had over the years been in the grips of ethno-religious crises, agitations, hatred, distress, insecurity, disunity, violence, hardship and general failure.
