Following resignation of Kano Deputy Governor, Professor Hafiz Abubakar, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje may likely choose a deputy today (Monday), Daily Trust learnt yesterday. Daily Trust reliably gathered that Ganduje might pick either the Commissioner of Agriculture, Alhaji Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna or his Private Personal Assistant, Alhaji Ibrahim Kamkarofi to replace Prof. Abubakar. A source said the governor was considering a good strategy to neutralise the political crisis in Kano Central over senatorial slot. It would be recalled that both Gawuna and Kamkarofi were among the politicians aspiring for the senatorial seat in 2019.
