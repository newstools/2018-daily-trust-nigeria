Troops of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS) have killed a total of 21 armed militants during a gun battle within the past three weeks in two separate confrontations in Guma Local Government Area of Benue State. Force Commander of OPWS, Major General Adeyemi Mutiu Yekini, said at a news conference on Monday in Makurdi that in the two different encounters which took place on August 4 and 18, the troop had felled the militants who he said were armed herdsmen. Yekini explained that in the first occurrence, the troop of Sector 2 with headquarters at Tomata community had made contact with the armed militia close to the boundary between Benue and Nasarawa states, stressing that during the fight which followed, unspecified number of them not less than six were suspected to be killed. He noted that the second encounter happened on Saturday while troops of the sector on routine fighting patrol along the Gbajimgba-Akor-Tomata axis encountered the armed herders in an exchanged fire for about two hours during which process at least 15 of the militias were killed. The Force commander admitted that one soldier was felled during the second encounter with the armed herders while two wounded others are currently receiving treatment at the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) base hospital in Makurdi. Yekini further disclosed that the troops burnt down the herdsmen camp and recovered some of AK47 rifles, AK47 magazines, ammunitions of different kinds and many other dangerous weapons also concealed in motorcycles. In another similar development, the Force Commander said a third operation carried out two days ago in response to recent killings allegedly masterminded by wanted kingpin, Terwase Akwaza popularly called Gana around the Kastina Ala local government area of the state, the troop raised down the camp belonging to the outlaw. â€œIt was not clear if Gana was killed during the assault but trails of blood seen in the building suspected to be where he slept suggested that he might have been hit. Effort is in progress to confirm if Gana was killed in the attack and if not we will still go after him," Yekini added.
