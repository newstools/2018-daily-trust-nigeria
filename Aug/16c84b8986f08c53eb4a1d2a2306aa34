Mali’s constitutional court has confirmed President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta’s re-election in a run-off ballot, rejecting his opponent’s allegation that it was fraudulent. According to official results, Mr Keita won the runoff on 12 August with 67.17% of the votes cast, against former minister Soumaïla Cissé who received 32.83% of the vote. Mr Cissé, who took part in a rally protesting the results on Saturday, says that he would have won the election with 51.75% of the vote if not for ballot stuffing and other violations - an allegation Mr Keïta denies. The court rejected Mr Cissé’s appeal on Monday, saying his allegation was inadmissible and unsupported by evidence, AFP news agency reports. Mr Keita will begin his second five-year term on 4 September.
