Journalist Jones Abiri, who has been detained by the Department of State Services (DSS) for over two years, has been released.   Abiri was released Wednesday after fulfilling the new terms of the varied bail granted him by a Chief Magistrate Court in Wuse Zone 2, Abuja.  Magistrate Chukwuemeka Nweke on August 8 varied the bail after his counsel, Bala Dakum complained of the stringent conditions attached to the previous bail.   Subsequently, the court asked Abiri to produce two sureties with at least one of them a Federal civil service on a minimum of Grade Level eight.   The Magistrate said the surety must submit an Employment Letter, Letter of Last Promotion, Bank Statement, and National ID Card.   Abiri was arraigned alongside Collins Trueman Opumei, an aide to Bayelsa State Governor on a one-count charge for alleged criminal intimidation.  The DSS said Abiri sent threat text messages to Nigerian AGIP Oil Company and Shell Development Company purportedly claiming N250 million from them. But he denied the charge.  DSS witnesses are expected to testify in the matter today.
