Residents of Gurbi community in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State have expressed concerns over an abandoned road project in their area, calling on the Minister of Works, Power and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, to ensure its completion given its economic importance to the area. The 11 km Kankara-Gurbi road which cuts across nine communities was awarded in November 2013, but abandoned by the contractor, it was gathered.  A spokesman of the community, Comrade Mudasir Lawal Gurbi, said the contractor had since evacuated all the machines and other materials from the site. “All our efforts to communicate with either the contractor, supervisor or any concerned authority proved abortive”, he said. Lawal said the project is vital to the socio-economic wellbeing of people in the area.
