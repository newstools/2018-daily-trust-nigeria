US President Donald Trump has responded to speculation that he might be impeached by warning that any such move would damage the economy. In an interview with Fox & Friends, he said the market would crash and “everybody would be very poor”. He was speaking after Michael Cohen, his ex-lawyer, pleaded guilty to violating election laws and said he had been directed to do so by Mr Trump. Mr Trump has rarely spoken about the prospect of being impeached. Correspondents say it is unlikely Mr Trump’s opponents would try to impeach him before November’s mid-term elections.
