The Fulani socio-cultural group, Gan Allah Fulani Development Association of Nigeria, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to address the infrastructural deficit in the north. The chairman of the group, Saleh Bayari made the call weekend in Jos while being conferred with the title of Garkuwan Matasan Arewa by the Northern Students Assembly of Nigeria. Bayari,  a former national secretary of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, urged Buhari to initiate “good projects” in the region. He said unlike people from some other parts of the country, northerners had never threatened the federal government with crisis. He said: “If you go to southern Nigeria like Ibadan you would see the road construction going on there, go and see Second Niger Bridge in Asaba, because they asked Buhari to do it for them, but here in the North we don’t do that.”
