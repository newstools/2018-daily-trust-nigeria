A suspected car part thief, Daniel Ekwerekwu, has been confirmed dead after he fell from the fence of a house he had gone to rob. The police said the suspect, who hails from Aguleri, Anambra State, according to details on the voter’s card recovered from him, was confirmed dead yesterday at Maryland Hospital. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, said the incident occurred yesterday morning at Okunade Street, Mende-Maryland, Ikeja. Oti said nemesis caught up with Ekwerekwu at the robbery scene where he had allegedly gone to steal car parts.  He said luck, however, ran against the suspect when one of the owners of the cars being vandalised woke up to prepare for church service around 6.30am only to see the thief vandalising his car. The man then raised an alarm which attracted a police patrol team from the Anthony police division on neighbourhood patrol and neighbours.
