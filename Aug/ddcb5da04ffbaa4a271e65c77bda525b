A former governor of Kano State, Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, yesterday declared his presidential bid on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2019 general elections. Kwankwaso, a former Defence Minister, while delivering his address in Abuja, blamed the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for not putting an end to Boko Haram and herdsmen killings in the country. “There is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for killings by Boko Haram insurgents, herdsmen, crop farmers, kidnappers, human traffickers and abductors. We will provide an atmosphere where there will be security, safety, serenity and sanity. “Nigeria in recent years has witnessed a weak economic performance due to tight economic policies and failed institutional supervision, especially as it relates to growing small enterprises that should in the long run result in larger ventures to anchor our economic prosperity. “The constant misuse of security apparatus will stop immediately. Ours is a recommitment to strengthening all democratic institutions in Nigeria. We shall also strive to create an all inclusive mechanism for effective intelligence gathering that involves all stakeholders. We shall motivate all affected communities, the military and the police to put an end to all killings,” he said. The ex-governor said his administration would restructure the country to ensure an inclusive political, social and economic space, adding that he would motivate all affected communities, the military and the police to put an end to all killings across the country. He added that his administration would step-up the nation’s unity, ensure economic stability and above all deliver good governance in all sectors, if given the mandate.
