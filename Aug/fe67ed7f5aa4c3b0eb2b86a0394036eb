The convoy of Minister of Women Affairs, Hajiya Jummai Alhassan, was attacked by thugs in Takum town yesterday, Daily Trust on Sunday gathered. The minister was in the area to monitor the state assembly by election.  It was gathered that the minister’s convoy was attacked by youths at Anguwan Dogo ward, which is a stronghold of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the area. Many vehicles, including the official vehicle of the minister, with registration number AE89 SDA, was vandalised by the thugs. The thugs also barricaded some streets and prevented the convoy from passing through. Daily Trust on Sunday learnt that it took the intervention of security agents to disperse the thugs. The minister, while reacting to the attack, said she was not surprised because she had earlier received information that some politicians had hired thugs to attack APC supporters in the area. The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP David Misal, said police were not aware of the attack. He said he was in the convoy of the state police commissioner monitoring the election in some polling units outside Takum town. The election was to fill the vacuum created by Mr. Hosea Ibi, the member representing Takum in the state House of Assembly, who was murdered last year.
