Oyo State governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, has urged the country’s pilgrims to the holy land to pray for sustained peace in the country and the wellbeing of its leaders at all levels. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Communication and Strategy, Mr. Bolaji Tunji, on Monday, the governor also called for prayers for a peaceful and credible general election in 2019. Similarly, Ajimobi appealed for fervent prayers for the safe return of the pilgrims to the Holy Land as they proceed to Mount Arafat for the crucial hajj rites, climaxing with throwing of pebbles, on Tuesday. The governor congratulated the Islamic adherents on the occasion of this year’s Eid al-Adha festival, which he said was being celebrated in an atmosphere of peace and cohesion of the country. Ajimobi commended the people of the state for their understanding and continued support for his administration in its quest to redefine governance and enhance its socio-economic fortunes. Ajimobi admonished motorists and travellers to ensure that their vehicles are in good conditions and to observe basic traffic rules in order to avert carnage on the roads during the holidays.
