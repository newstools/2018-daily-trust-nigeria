Thousands of Bangladeshi high school students have been protesting for a fifth day after two teenagers were killed by a speeding bus. The demonstrators have brought the capital Dhaka to a virtual standstill. A government minister has accused them of hypocrisy, triggering further anger. The education ministry has closed high schools across the country and promised to take their demands into account. But this did not end the protests. "They should have taken our demands seriously, but they didn't," Imran Ahmed said.
