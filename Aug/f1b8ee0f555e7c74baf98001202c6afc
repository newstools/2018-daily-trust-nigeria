Russia has revealed the extent of its military involvement in Syria’s war. A defence ministry video said more than 63,000 Russian military personnel had “received combat experience” in the country since September 2015. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said at the end of last year that 48,000 personnel had been deployed. The video also said Russian air force had flown 39,000 sorties, destroying 121,466 “terrorist targets” and killing more than 86,000 “militants”. There was no mention of any Russian military or Syrian civilian casualties. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, says at least 7,928 civilians and 10,069 combatants have been killed in Russian air strikes.
