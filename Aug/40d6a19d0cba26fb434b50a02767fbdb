A strong earthquake hit Indonesia’s Lombok Island on Thursday, causing buildings to collapse and sending already traumatised people rushing out of shelters. The magnitude-6.2 earthquake followed a 6.9-magnitude quake on Sunday that killed at least 259 people, damaged thousands of buildings, and left 156,000 people homeless. Indonesia’s geological agency said the quake was shallow, at a depth of 12km, centred in the northeast of the island. The US Geological Survey measured the tremor at magnitude-5.9. It did not have the potential to cause a tsunami. It was the third big quake to hit Lombok in little more than a week. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries. Sunday’s quake wiped out entire villages in the worst-hit regions of northern and western Lombok. The disaster agency’s death toll from the earthquake was raised to 259 from 131.
