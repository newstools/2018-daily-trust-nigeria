A newborn baby has been found dumped near a petrol station in Kuje, Abuja. The baby, which was found by a pedestrian, was wrapped in a piece of cloth stained with blood beside Azman Petrol Station, Kuje. A resident, Michael Israel, said the newborn was found at about 8:15pm yesterday. He said a pedestrian heard the cry of a baby and alerted people near the filling station. Some people in the crowd removed the cloth and discovered that it was a new born baby that had been abandoned. According to him, two elderly women who were invited to the scene cleaned the baby and took it to the Gomo of Kuje. The Gomo of Kuje, Alhaji Haruna Jibrin Tanko, said the baby had been taken to the Social Welfare Department of the council. The chairman of the council, Alhajo Abdullahi D. Galadima, who spoke through his special adviser on media and publicity, Haruna Usman, said the council has already directed that the baby be taken to hospital for proper treatment and later to a motherless home in the area.
