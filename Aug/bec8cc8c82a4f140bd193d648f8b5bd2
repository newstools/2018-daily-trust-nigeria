Air strikes on Thursday by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia on a fishing port and fish market in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah killed 26 people, Yemeni medical sources and aid agencies said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Twitter it was sending medical equipment to Al Thawra Hospital to treat 50 people in critical condition following the attack. The hospital said a strike targeted its main gate, leaving dozens of casualties while Houthi-run Saba news agency said 40 were killed in the strike. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Sunni allies have been fighting in Yemen with Western backing for more than three years against the Iran-aligned Houthis. The Houthis control much of north Yemen including the capital Sanaa and drove its Saudi-backed government into exile in 2014.
