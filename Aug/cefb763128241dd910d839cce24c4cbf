Some youths in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have written to the Nigerian Law Reform Commission (NLRC) calling for the review of the FCT Act to stem the tide of communal conflicts. The youths, under the aegis of Abuja Original Inhabitants Youth Empowerment Organisation (AOIYEO), said the reviewed would be necessary to align the Act with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution and other judicial pronouncements. This he said would put an end to series of communal conflicts generated by the imbalance in the formulation and implementation of the Act since the advent of democratic rule The president of AOIYEO, Isaac David, in a letter to the acting chairman of NLRC Mr Kefas Magaji, lamented that series of communal conflicts have arisen. He said the application of the Land Use Act in the territory was subject of several judicial pronouncements in favour of the original inhabitants but these have never been implemented. “The FCT Act and the Land Use Act ought to be revisited with a view to reviewing specific provisions therein to assuage the lingering economic, social, political and cultural difficulties of the initial inhabitants of the FCT in the overriding interest of justice,” he said. He said the Land Use Act must be reviewed because it did not consider the right of the original owners of the land adding that FCT has a state status and should be treated as one of the states in Nigeria.
