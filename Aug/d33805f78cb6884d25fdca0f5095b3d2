The management of a gas plant, Second Coming Nigeria Ltd, Magodo area of Lagos has appealed to Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to save their company from dying as a result of its closure. The management said the appeal became necessary in view of the over N1billion indebtedness hanging on the company in various banks. The state government had in January 2018 sealed up the plant after a serious explosion, siting a breach in the safety procedure for such a gas plant for the closure. It also constituted a panel of inquiry to ascertain the cause of the explosion to prevent recurrence in future. After the investigation by the Lagos State Safety Commission, a letter dated February 23, 2018 and signed by the Director - Chief Executive Officer, Hakeem Dickson, granted the management conditional approval for the reopening of the plant. The companyâ€™s secretary, Ifenna Okeke, who addressed the media yesterday, said besides the huge financial loss incurred by the company, the fate of the staff is hanging in the balance.
