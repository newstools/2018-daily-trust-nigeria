The authorities in Comoros are reported to have declared that an overwhelming majority has backed constitutional changes that could keep the current president in power for a further decade. The system of rotating the presidency between the three main islands would be abolished and Islam declared as the state religion. The French news agency AFP says the official result concluded that almost 93% of voters backed the changes. The opposition, which called for a boycott, said Mondayâ€™s referendum was nothing short of a power grab by President Azali Assoumani.
