A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tukur Buratai, to pay the sum of N11 million as damages for the unlawful detention of 11 Gombe State indigenes. Those detained include: James Yusuf, Ishaya Ali Poshiya, Nehemiah Yohanna Poshiya, Husseini Poshiya, Hamma Poshiya, Yusuf Mafindi, Yila Boyi, James Bare, Ezekiel Dandaudu, Ali Ishaku and Ilya Bala. In a fundamental rights enforcement suit brought through their counsel, Mela Audu Nunghe, the applicants alleged that they were kept in detention since July 6, 2018 by the Nigerian Army. They told the court that they were detained following the killing of one David Jauro Stephen, who had on July 6, 2018, gone to his farm where he was attacked by persons from a neighbouring village, Shongom. The applicants were reportedly in the process of taking his body home when they were arrested by the Army and taken to the Gombe Army Barracks. A copy of the judgment cited by our reporter said that the presiding judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu on August 14 held that “the long detention and torture without detention order of the applicant since the 6th day of July 2018 by servants and agents of the 1st defendant (Buratai) is illegal and unconstitutional and is a violation of the applicants’ fundamental rights.” Consequently, the court ordered the army and the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (second defendant) to immediately release the applicants.
