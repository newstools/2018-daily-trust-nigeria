The death toll from a major earthquake on the Indonesian island of Lombok reached more than 430 on Monday. Bodies were still being pulled from destroyed buildings following the shallow 6.9-magnitude quake on August 5 that levelled tens of thousands of homes, mosques, and businesses across Lombok. A week earlier, another tremor hammered the island, killing 17 people. “Search-and-rescue teams are still removing victims who were buried beneath collapsed buildings and landslides,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman from the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.
