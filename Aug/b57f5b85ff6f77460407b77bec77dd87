Some stalwarts of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and 482 other members have defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gudun-Karya ward of Kuje Area Council, Abuja. Among the party’s stalwarts   were Iliya Bulus, Sule Ayuba, Madam Aboki and Abdulrahman Zagabutu. Chairman of the Kuje chapter of APC, Mr. Godwin Poyi, who received the decampees, said there was no doubt that the achievements of the ruling APC government in the council have attracted some members of the PDP to dump the opposition party. He said he was impressed with the bold step taken by the former PDP members, adding that APC will always give them equal treatment with other party members. A former PDP stalwart, Mr. Iliya Bulus, said he mobilized over 482 members of the PDP across seven communities under Gudunkarya ward to  decamp because of the performance of the ruling APC in the council. He said apart from the performance of the council chairman, some of the opposition members have witnessed progress, especially in the areas of anti-corruption fight, the economy and security under the APC-led administration. “We have clearly seen what the APC governments at federal and area council levels have done so far. This made us to come together, after several meetings, to join APC in Gudunkarya ward,” he said. Bulus assured the APC chairman in the area that they would deliver block votes to the APC during the forthcoming general and area council elections. On his part, the council chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, said he was elated with the former PDP stalwarts and some of their members for identifying with his administration’s performance despite the financial challenges since he assumed office. Galadima solicited for the support of the former PDP stalwarts and their members, saying his administration will give them equal treatment as APC members so that the party will continue to wax stronger in the area.
