The Assistant Controller General (ACG) of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Fire Service, Mr. Julius Opetunsin, has cautioned filling stations in the territory against dispensing fuel during the day time as any spark could lead to fire outbreak. ACG Opetunsin gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. He said filling stations should endeavour to dispense fuel at night when the weather was cool. “Filling stations should discharge fuel at night when there is no sun because any spark while dispensing fuel during the day time could be disastrous,” he said. The ACG said the agency’s Fire Prevention and Protection Unit and the Enforcement Unit had been sensitising filling station attendants on how to effectively dispense fuel. “We move round filling stations to inspect them and to know if they have adequate fire defence equipment,” he said. NAN reports that the  service had warned that any filling station found dispensing fuel during the day time would be sealed and fined a minimum of N500,000.
