Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar has dismissed claims by Bauchi State House of Assembly member representing Dass Constituency, Maryam Garba Bagel over alleged threat‎ to her life. In a statement, his Special Adviser on Media and Strategy, Ali M. Ali describe the claims by the lawmaker as mere hallucinations.  "Our attention has been drawn to the fantastic claims made by Maryam Bagel, a member of the Bauchi state House of Assembly to the effect that the Bauchi state Governor, His Excellency Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar (esq) is behind some faceless elements intent on ‘humiliating’ her by portraying her as “immoral” person via her pictures photo shopped into pornographic images."  "We found this amusing. At no   point, Bagel constituted a “threat” or even a “nuisance” to the government of MA Abubakar to the extent that it will resort to this reprehensible measure. The governor has a cast iron reputation of moral uprightness. His moral credentials are beyond reproach."  "It is therefore, inconceivable   that he will encourage let alone sponsor such  desperate measure. He has repeatedly and publicly stated that he bears no ill will or malice against anyone especially antagonistic elements.  The statement noted that the lawmaker resorted to blackmail and hallucinatory  measures as a result of the electoral humiliation she suffered in the recent Bauchi South Senatorial bye-election.  "The media should be weary of sensational claims of desperate politicians as we approach elections,"it added.  It could be recalled that the lawmaker‎ had claimed that her life is allegedly being threatened by some people due to her political stance.
