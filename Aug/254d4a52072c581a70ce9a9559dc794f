The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Muhammad Musa Bello, has solicited the support of the FCT Police Command to check insecurity and vandalism of public assets in the territory. Bello, represented by the Executive Secretary of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), Engr. Umar Jibrin, made the call while on a courtesy visit to the new FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, on   Thursday. The minister expressed concern on the high rate of armed robbery and kidnapping on the Bwari-Jere-Kaduna Highway and vandalisation of streetlights, electricity cables, manholes and outright burning of transformers. He, therefore, sought for maximum support from the new police boss to stem the tide. Responding, Bala Ciroma commended the FCT Administration on infrastructural development, adding that there could be no meaningful development without adequate security. CP Ciroma said the safeguarding of critical government infrastructure belonged to the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), but that he would instruct his men to be vigilant and work hand-in-hand with the corps. The commissioner assured that security would be beefed up on the Bwari-Jere-Kaduna Highway, and solicited assistance from the minister in the area of mobility and communication equipment.
