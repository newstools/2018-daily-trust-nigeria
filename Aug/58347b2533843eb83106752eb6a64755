A former governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa, has said there is no need for consensus among the increasing number of presidential aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking with newsmen yesterday at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja where he obtained his expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the presidential ticket of the party ahead of the 2019 general elections, Bafarawa said the number of presidential aspirants showed the party was waxing stronger. He added that the aspirants would accept the outcome of the primaries and work with the candidate with the collective goal of defeating the APC.
