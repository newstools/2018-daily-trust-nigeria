About 55,000 Nigerians are expected to perform this year’s hajj, the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), has said. This is a decrease from last year’s figure when over 70,000 Nigerians took part. “For this year, about 55,000 Nigerians will be performing the hajj,” NAHCON chairman, Abdullahi Mukhtar, told journalists in Abuja yesterday, adding that the reduction was due to the early closure of pilgrims registration by the Saudi Arabian authorities. According to him, majority of Nigerian pilgrims register for hajj at least one week before the exercise begins. He added that the window of last week registration was no longer available.
