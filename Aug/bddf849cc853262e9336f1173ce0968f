Twenty-three ministers are attending the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC).

They were already in the Council Chamber few minutes after 10a.m when the meeting started. 

Acting President Yemi Osinbajo is currently presiding over the meeting.

In the past, many of the cabinet members always stay away from such meetings when the President was out of the country. 

The Acting President started the meeting 10am against the usual 11a.m commencement time when President Muhammadu Buhari is presiding.
