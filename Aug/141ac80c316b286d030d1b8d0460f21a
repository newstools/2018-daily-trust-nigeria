The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has challenged the presidency and the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to appear for a debate with the opposition party on good governance. The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Sunday said the party has thoroughly reviewed the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and submitted that it has “irredeemably failed in every sector of national life.” The party argued that available data, both locally and internationally, confirmed that the Buhari administration had failed in all its promises and claims, particularly on fight against corruption, economy, security, democracy as well as national unity and cohesion. “The PDP is ready to commence a series to expose the lies and failures of this administration as well as the huge liability, woes and dangers it has brought on our nation," the party said.
