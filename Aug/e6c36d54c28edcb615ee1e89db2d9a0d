The Lagos State governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, yesterday commissioned an ultra- modern ferry terminal and the headquarters of the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) at Falomo with a resolve to spare no effort to harness the potentials of the water transport sector for the overall benefit of residents. Ambode, who also commissioned a multi-level car park within the same premises, said the unveiling of the edifice, which was delivered through a public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement with MTN Nigeria, signposted the readiness, willingness and ability of the state government to effectively take full control of its waterways. The governor, who was represented by the state’s Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Adeniji Kazeem, said, “We have invested significantly in the provision of water transportation infrastructure, especially the rehabilitation of existing and construction of new jetties, purchase of two clearing machines with navigational equipment to tackle the challenges posed by water hyacinth and the ongoing installation of safety signs for routes demarcation, among others. “In addition, we have concluded plans for the procurement of seven high-capacity passenger ferries to complement the existing ones, while we also plan to assist commercial ferry operators to acquire new standard boats,” he said. Gov Ambode commended MTN Nigeria for partnering and contributing to the realization of the state government’s objectives in the water transport sector and urged other private sector stakeholders to take advantage of the emerging investment opportunities in the Lagos water transport sector. The Chief Executive Officer of MTN Nigeria, Mr Ferdi Moolman, expressed the company’s delight in partnering with the state government to deliver another milestone he believed would lead to a better transport system and improved quality of lives for millions of the state’s residents. Facilities at the ferry terminal include a ticketing point, a passenger lounge, VIP Lounge, elevator and standard conveniences.
