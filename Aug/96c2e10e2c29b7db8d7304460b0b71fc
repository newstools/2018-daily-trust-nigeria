A fierce fight between two rival gangs yesterday claimed the lives of nine people in Tse-Ujoh in Ikyurav-Tiev community of Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. Daily Trust Saturday gathered that the gang members have been operating around the Sankera axis of the state which consists of three local government areas of Kastina-Ala, Ukum and Logo. Residents said the rival groups had in recent times engaged each other in supremacy battles for the criminal control of the area and groups were responsible for the killing of many people early last year at the popular yam market in Zakibiam, Ukum LGA. The residents alleged that the latest killings came after the resignation of a member from the nucleus body so that he could operate in isolation, a development said to have angered his other colleagues who insisted that he remained part of them. It was learnt that the aggrieved gangsters went after their breakaway colleague who in turn resisted them at various points, leading to the killings. Police spokesman, DSP Moses Yamu,Â  said the attack was carried out on Thursday by gangsters who had been terrorizing the community, adding that eight people were confirmed dead by while the ninth person died in hospital yesterday. Meanwhile, Governor Samuel Ortom has urged communities in the Sankera area to assist security operatives with useful information to end the attacks. His Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, said the governor described the situation as unacceptable, even as troops have been deployed to the affected area.
