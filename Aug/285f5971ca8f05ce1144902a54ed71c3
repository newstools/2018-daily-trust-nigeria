An Egyptian military court sentenced a poet to three years in prison on Tuesday for publishing false news and insulting the military after he gained publicity for writing a satirical song that criticized the government, his lawyer said. U.N. human rights experts had urged the government last week to acquit Galal El Behairy, expressing alarm at his arrest. The charges against Behairy are related to the title of an anthology of poems that plays on a phrase used to describe the military, which former general Sisi headed before he was first elected president in 2014.
