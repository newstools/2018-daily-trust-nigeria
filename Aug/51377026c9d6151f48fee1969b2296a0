A police Special Anti-Robbery Squad operative attached to the Iwo Area command, Osun State, has been arrested for allegedly killing a polytechnic undergraduate, Tunde Nafiu. The SARS operative was alleged to have shot the 30-year-old student on Thursday night at the Agboigboro area of Iwo. The incident led to a riot the next day in which youths in the community burnt down the police area command in the town. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Fimihan Adeoye, confirmed the policeman, whose name he wouldn’t disclose, was arrested yesterday and detained in Osogbo, the state capital. Adeoye said he had visited the family of the late student and assured them that the SARS operative would face the full wrath of the law. Meanwhile, 31 persons have been arrested in the community over the riot in which properties, including police vehicles and buildings, were destroyed. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Folasade Odoro, told Daily Trust that the suspects torched the buildings housing the offices and residence of the Area Commander, as well as three patrol vans and two other vehicles belonging to the officers of the Area Command. “The police exercised serious restraint in order to prevent further loss of lives. However, the hoodlums were eventually dispersed, while 31 of them were arrested and are undergoing interrogation. The situation has been brought under control, while people are going about their lawful businesses,” Odoro said.
