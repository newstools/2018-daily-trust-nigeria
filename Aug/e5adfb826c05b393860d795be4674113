The Akwa Ibom State Government has sacked the Commissioner for Labour, Productivity and Manpower Development, Ibanga Akpabio and that of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Victor Antai. Ibanga, a younger brother of Senator Godswill Akpabio and Antai, were among those who received Akpabio from the Ibom International Airport on his arrival in the state for his formal defection from the People’s Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. Speaking yesterday in Uyo, the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Charles Udoh, said the two commissioners were relieved from their positions over gross misconduct, non-compliance with public service rules and anti-government activities. The Secretary to the State Government, Emmanuel Ekuwem, said the sack was with immediate effect and the affected persons were directed to handover to the permanent secretary in the ministries before close of work yesterday. He said: “The State Government has dropped  the Commissioner, Ministry of Labour and Productivity, Sir Ibanga Akpabio from the state Executive Council with immediate effect. Sir Ibanga Akpabio had to be removed from the State Executive Council following his reluctance to comply with good governance processes of government.”
