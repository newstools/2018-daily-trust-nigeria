A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered accelerated hearing into the suit by four Nigerian voters challenging the difficulty in the transfer of voter registration to another state. Justice Nnamdi Dimgba on Monday also agreed that the matter is of urgency, and directed the service of the court papers on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Four individuals - Joel Onumonu, Bala Angyau, Jenner Nwosu and Bello Toluwase - had approached the court through their lawyer, Abel Ozioko, challenging the practice by INEC. They contend that the practice prevents voters from voting at “a presidential election in Nigeria in a state of his current residence other than the one in which he was registered, unless and until he fulfils the defendant’s requirement of applying to INEC or to the Resident Electoral Commissioner, for transfer of his voter registration from the state or polling area in which he is currently resident.” The plaintiffs are contending that that the practice is an infringement of their legal entitlement to a free exercise of right to vote in Presidential Elections in Nigeria as guaranteed by Section 132 (5) of the Constitution, adding that “it constitutes violation of Section 132 (4) of the Constitution and of the intendment of the legislature in Section 9 (1) of the Electoral Act 2010.” The suit has been adjourned to September 5 for hearing.
