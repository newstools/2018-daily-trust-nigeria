The Ona of Abaji and chairman of the Council of Traditional Rulers in the FCT, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has urged the youth against being used as political thugs in the build up to the 2019 elections. The Ona gave the charge when he received a House of Representatives aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Hassan Usman Sokodabo, in his palace on Saturday. He urged politicians to pray for the continued peace and unity of the chiefdom and not to use their supporters as political thugs during the election. He also said they should avoid unguarded utterances against their opponents so as not to ignite violence. The traditional head said he was overwhelmed by the aspirant’s desire to contest for the House of Representatives seat in the Abuja South Federal Constituency. “It is God that gives power to whom He soever wishes at any appointed time, but all we need is peace in the entire Abaji chiefdom,” he said. The chairman of PDP in the area, Alhaji Idris Gana Yaba, told the traditional ruler that he led the aspirant for his royal blessing as he seeks to contest for the House of Representatives seat.
