The Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA) has commenced the repair of some dilapidated roads within Gwagwalada metropolis. Speaking with newsmen yesterday, while inspecting the work, the FERMA engineer in charge of the FCT, Mr. Omameh Ambrose, said the road is being repaired through direct labour and will last for two weeks. He reiterated the agency’s commitment to repairing roads across the FCT.  He also said FERMA has commenced the rehabilitation of the first segment of the road from SDP junction to University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, adding that FERMA deemed it fit to rehabilitate such roads which linked the FCT to Niger State through the Gwagwalada-Izom road. He appealed to motorists to be patient while approaching traffic signs to allow the ongoing rehabilitation work to move faster.
