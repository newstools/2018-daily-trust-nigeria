Ahead of the Eld-el-Kabir celebration, Gov. Abdulfatah Ahmed of Kwara has directed the Ministry of Finance to commence the immediate payment of August salary to workers. The Commissioner for Finance, Alhaji Demola Banu, who disclosed this on Wednesday in Ilorin, said arrangements have been concluded and a facility secured to ensure workers begin to receive salaries from Thursday. He said the governor’s  directive was  to ensure that the workers have an enjoyable Sallah celebration. Banu said the governor’s directive was coming at a time the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee had yet to meet. According to him, this testifies to the government’s commitment to the welfare of the people. Banu said local government councils and SUBEB were  also expected to pay their workers on Thursday. (NAN)
