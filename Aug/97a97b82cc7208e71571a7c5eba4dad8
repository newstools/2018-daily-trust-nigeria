The Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ibrahim Idris, in compliance with a Presidential directive has ordered the immediate overhaul of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), across the country. A statement yesterday by Police spokesman, acting DCP Jimoh Moshood said the outfit will now be known as Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS). He said a new Commissioner of Police has been appointed as the overall head of the FSARS, saying all SARS teams nationwide have been collapsed under FSARS. Moshood said the move is also to address complaints and allegations of human rights violations against some of the personnel of SARS from members of the public in some parts of the country. Acting President Yemi Osinbajo had yesterday ordered the immediate overhaul of the SARS. There have been numerous calls especially on social media for the scrap of SARS over several incidents of brutality, human rights abuses and harassment by its operatives. Osinbajo in a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande said the directive for the overhaul was sequel to the persistent complaints by Nigerians against the squad, bordering on allegations of human rights violations. The Acting President directed the IGP to with immediate effect overhaul the management and activities of SARS. The IG was also directed to ensure that any unit that will emerge from the process, would be intelligence-driven and restricted to the prevention, detection of armed robbery and kidnapping, and apprehension of offenders linked to the stated offences, and nothing more. The Acting President further directed the IGP to ensure that all operatives in the emerging unit conduct their operations in strict adherence to the rule of law and with due regard to International Human Rights Law and the constitutionally guaranteed rights of suspects. “The operatives should also bear proper identification anytime they are on duty,” he said. Osinbajo directed the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to set up a Special Panel that will conduct an investigation of the alleged unlawful activities of SARS. Osinbajo said the panel would afford members of the general public the opportunity to present their grievances with a view to ensuring redress. Moshood also said, aggrieved members of the public who have any complaint in the past or present of violation of their rights by any SARS personnel anywhere in the country to report to the police for investigation.
