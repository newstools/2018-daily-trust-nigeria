US space agency Nasa has launched its mission to send a satellite closer to the Sun than any before. The Parker Solar Probe rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The probe is set to become the fastest-moving manmade object in history. Its data promises to crack longstanding mysteries about the Sun’s behaviour. It is the first space craft to be named after a living person - astrophysicist Eugene Parker, 91, who first described solar wind in 1958. The Delta-IV Heavy rocket - which was carrying the probe - launched at 03:31 local time (07:31 GMT). It came after a failed attempt the previous day, when a last-minute alarm caused the agency to miss its 65-minute weather window.  Just under an hour after the launch, Nasa confirmed that the spacecraft had successfully separated and the probe had been released into space.
