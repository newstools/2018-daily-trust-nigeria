Six people including three armed robbers were killed late Thursday when armed robbers attacked a commercial bank and a police station in Igara, headquarters of Akoko-Edo LGA of Edo State. The state Commissioner of Police, Babatunde Johnson Kokumo, said the robbers were killed in a gun battle with the police guarding the bank and another one nearby. “The robbers split themselves, with one mandated to go to  the police station, apparently to prevent the police from responding to a possible distress call from the bank,” he said. He added that during the attack on the  police station, an inspector and two civilians were killed. “When the other half got to the Keystone Bank, they forcefully entered the banking hall, and when the distress call came from the bank the police could not move there as it was under attack,” “But the police on guard at the  bank and others at the Unity Bank close to it engaged them in a gun battle and in the process three of the criminals were gunned down, and their arms were recovered,” he said. He said a robber who sustained injuries died later but was able to give useful information that will assist investigation.
