The Lagos State police command said it has arrested about 40 more suspected members of various secret cult gangs for their alleged involvement in series of violent clashes in theÂ  Ajah, Epe and Sangotedo areas of the state. The latest arrest last week came on the heels of the arrest two weeks ago of about 120 suspected members of the Black Axe, Aye and Eiye cult groups in Ikorodu, Lagos, with three of the suspects confessing to the recent murder, in Shomolu, of Chop Up, who was an aide to Rotimi Olowo, a legislator at the Lagos State House of Assembly. The suspects arrested last week were understood to have been intercepted while they were carrying out various initiations of new members. Items said to have been recovered from them included a locally made double-barrelled gun, a single-barrelled cut-to-size rifle and machetes. Some of the gang members were identified as Ayinla Asis, Peter Segun, Balogun and Goddy Samuel. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who confirmed the incident, said that the suspects had been raining terror on many areas in Lagos. Edgal also expressed worry about the rate at which youths were joining different deadly cult gangs in the state.
