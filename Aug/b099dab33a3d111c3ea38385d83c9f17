A Nigerian national in South Africa, Okolie Olileanyi Paul, has been killed by a fellow Nigerian in that country. This is coming barely three weeks after a 42 year-old Nigerian, Chibuzor-Nwankwo was shot dead by Lawrence Nwarienne, also a Nigerian operating a bar in South Africa, in the early hours of July 27th in Kempton Park, Johannesburg. The Nigeria Union South Africa (NUSA) in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Iyke Odefa, said the 28-year old Paul from Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State was allegedly stabbed to death by a fellow Nigerian and a housemate, Mr Donald Mordi who hails from Ika Northeast LGA in Delta State. Odefa said the deceased was stabbed during an argument that resulted into physical combat. According to him, the ugly incident happened in Roodenport West Rand on August 17 in the wee hours when an argument ensued between the duo. “The assailant stabbed the deceased to death with several deep cuts,” he said. “Mordi has been on the run since the gruesome murder. The police have been informed, thus, a case file has since been opened. “The legal desk of the Nigerian Union South Africa (NUSA) is already on the case. “We appeal to the law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned until the culprit is apprehended and brought to justice. “We convey our sincere condolences to the deceased family,” he added.
