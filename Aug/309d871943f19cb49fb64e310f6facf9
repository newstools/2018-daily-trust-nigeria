The former Acting National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, yesterday said he is fully committed to the realisation of the presidential ambition of Senate President Bukola Saraki. Baraje, who said this in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital on the sideline of the graduation ceremony of students from the Baraje Centre for Arabic and Islamic Studies, said Saraki has what it takes to become the president of Nigeria. He said the Senate president had been nursing the ambition since 2011 but withdrew voluntarily for both Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari in 2011 and 2015. “Saraki has been trying his luck to be president since 2011 but withdrew for Jonathan and did same thing for Buhari in 2015. With his ambition, it is right and I will go to any place for him to win because what Nigerians are looking for is in him. He is the only one that can right the wrongs in Nigeria today and I will give him my strong support,” he also said. While reacting to a question on the alleged plan to impeach him by the ruling APC over his seat in the Senate, Baraje said only the senators could elect and impeach their president. On whether Saraki’s defection is a miscalculation, the PDP chieftain said “Anything that is politically blended is politically possible. Saraki considered a lot of things before decamping. For those of us who know him know that he consulted widely before taking a decision. In fact, he consulted up to a fault before decamping to the PDP and did a lot of consideration.” Baraje also disclosed that his formal declaration for the PDP would soon hold in his ward, adding that he belongs to where his leader is.
