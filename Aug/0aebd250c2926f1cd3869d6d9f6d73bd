The Middle Belt Forum has protested siege on Benue State House of Assembly, saying they would hold President Muhammadu Buhari responsible if there is a breakdown of law and order in the state. The forum’s protest came on the heels of eight members of the assembly serving an impeachment notice on Governor Samuel Ortom on Monday. Ortom had defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the All Progressives Congress (APC). President of the forum, Dr Pogu Bitrus, who briefed newsmen at the end of a meeting said, “It is shameful that President Buhari who realised after about four months that his Inspector General of Police did not obey his directive to go and secure lives in Benue State and has done nothing to him is so eager to deploy policemen to the State to enforce illegality for political calculations. “The Benue people, in particular and the entire people of Middle Belt, in general will perceive any breakdown of law and order by this illegality as a declaration of war on the people of Middle Belt by the federal government.”
