Troops of the 81-Division Task Force Battalion under the Operation Lafiya Dole in Borno State have killed four Boko Haram insurgents and recovered some weapons. The troops, while conducting counter terrorism and counter insurgency operations in northeast on Tuesday, killed three insurgents in a failed ambush staged by the sect members along Gulumba Gana - Masa - Dikwa road in Dikwa Local Government Area of Borno state. Army spokesman at the Theatre Command in Maiduguri, Col. Onyema Nwachukwu, said in a statement yesterday that shortly before the ambush, the troops who were on a fighting patrol had uncovered  two Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) buried in the ground along the road by the terrorists. “While the troops carried out counter IED actions to disarm the explosives, the insurgents sprang the ambush but met with fierce resistance by the troops, who swiftly countered the ambush, killing three of the insurgents, while others fled with gunshot wounds. The troops also captured two AK 47 rifles,  one Light Machine Gun and an empty magazine from the terrorists. “One of the troops who unfortunately sustained injury during the encounter is currently receiving medical attention in our medical facility,” Col. Nwachukwu said, adding that in a separate operation, also conducted on Tuesday, troops of the 3-Battalion, successfully staged an ambush against Boko Haram insurgents traversing a crossing point behind Ngamboru town in the state. “The troops neutralized one Boko Haram insurgent and recovered one AK-47 rifle and seven rounds of 7.62 MM ammunition during the ambush,” he said. He urged members of the public to report persons with gunshot wounds seeking medical attention to security agencies.
