Donald Trump’s election campaign has begun legal action against an ex-White House aide and reality TV star for allegedly breaching her contract. Donald J Trump for President, Inc has filed for arbitration against Omarosa Manigault Newman, claiming she violated a 2016 non-disclosure agreement. A feud between the two has escalated as Mrs Newman promotes a new book that is very critical of him. On Tuesday, Mr Trump angrily denied her claim he was taped using the N-word. He tweeted: “I don’t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have.” Mrs Newman - a former star of The Apprentice who was fired after a stint as a White House adviser - claimed that Mr Trump was recorded using the word while working on the show he hosted for 11 years. But she has not said she ever heard him using the word himself.
