A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Helpline Foundation for the Needy, has made case for youths’ engagement in political and digital spaces. The group, in collaboration with MC Tagwaye Foundation, Brekete Family and Echoes Africa Initiative, made the call at an event as part of activities to commemorate the 2018 International Youths Day. The NGOs expressed worry that despite the intellectual and numerical strength of the youths in the country, they were still relegated to the background in the political space, noting that the time was now to change the narrative. President and Founder of Helpline Foundation for the Needy, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, harped on the need for the youths to be engaged, educated and entertained, just as she emphasised that the hope of the country rested with them. “It is time the youths participate in the scheme of affairs so that they can contribute their quota positively in the development of our nation, Africa and the world at large in line with the 2018 Youth Day theme. “As it has been recognised, youths need safe spaces where they can come together, engage in activities related to their diverse needs and interests, participate in decision making processes and freely express themselves,” she said.
