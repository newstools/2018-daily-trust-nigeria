The FCT chapter of the Australian Alumni Association of Nigeria has organised a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programme for its members on project management. The president of the association, Dr Bridget Momoh, said the need for the training was to acquaint members with project management skills. He said the association was building capacities and re-enforcing what the participants had already learnt during their scholarship period in Australia. “We also hope to learn and apply project management and strategic planning principles in our various places of work. The participants at the training come from very diverse sectors of the economy,” Dr Momoh said. The project facilitator, Mr Gideon Peter, said the training was organized in collaboration with E&F Management Consulting Limited, explaining that the project was an achiever tool that cut across every aspect of human endeavour. “If you have the mind-set of a project manager, the wastages across sectors will not exist. And also the undermining of the human resource will not happen because we will maximise the people and resources we have,” he said. A participant, Dr Olajumoke Akiode, said the knowledge of project management would help expand her professional horizon and make her more efficient as a leader.
