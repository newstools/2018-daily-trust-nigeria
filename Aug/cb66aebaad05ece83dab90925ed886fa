Nigeria has warned its pilgrims to refrain from displaying political banners and posters in Muna and Arafat as 2018 Hajj begins on Sunday. The chairman and chief executive of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), Abdullahi Mukhtar Muhammad, disclosed this during a pre-Arafat meeting with Nigerian Hajj stakeholders in Makkah. Saudi authorities said about 1.6 million Muslims from across the world, comprising over 55,000 Nigerians will perform this year’s Hajj, the fifth pillar of the Islamic faith. “Don’t paste or hang any banner that is political in nature. There should be no picture of any individual inside or outside our tents,” the chairman said. The NAHCON chief said Saudi Arabian authorities don’t accept any politicking during Hajj. Daily Trust reports that over the years, state pilgrims officials display political campaign banners in the entrances of their tents. In Arafat and Muna, Nigerian tents are usually adorned with banners of state governors and their First Ladies, as well as other politicians, purportedly wishing their pilgrims successful hajj. Nigerian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Justice Muhammad Dodo also urged Nigerian pilgrims to pray for their country. “We have no alternative than to pray for our country,” the envoy said. He said Nigeria is facing lots of challenges of insecurity, among others which makes praying for the country, more than expedient. “We are going for elections next year; let’s pray to God to enable us have a peaceful elections,” Ambassador Dodo said.
