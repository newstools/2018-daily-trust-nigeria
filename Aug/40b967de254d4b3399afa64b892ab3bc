Malians voted in a run-off presidential election under heavy security on Sunday, with incumbent Ibrahim Boubacar Keita expected to win a second term despite a surge in ethnic and militant violence during his tenure. Keita, 73, is running against Soumalia Cisse, 68, the main opposition leader and a former finance minister. The first round on July 29 was marred by armed attacks and other security incidents at about a fifth of polling places, as well as opposition charges of fraud. Keita took 41 percent of the vote in the first round against nearly 18 percent for Cisse. As voting progressed throughout Sunday, however, no serious incidents had been reported. Soldiers ran body checks on voters in the capital Bamako as they waited in line under rainy skies to cast their ballots. The government has stepped up security for the run-off, deploying an extra 6,000 troops on top of the 30,000 already on duty.Â  Keita called for a peaceful day and urged people not to respond to any provocation as he voted in Bamako on Sunday morning.
