Over 5000 ex-Nigeria Airways workers have begged President Muhammadu Buhari to pay their terminal benefits. The National Chairman, Nigerian Union of Pensioners, Nigerian Airways Branch, Sam Nzene in a chat with Daily Trust in Abuja said the association resorted to plead with the President for prompt payment of their claims. Recall President Buhari had about sixteen months ago approved the payment of about N45 billion, being total terminal benefits of the staff of the defunct Nigerian Airways that was liquidated in 2003 by then President Olusegun Obasanjo. Nzene said efforts by the association to meet with the minister of Finance; Mrs Kemi Adesoun over the delayed payment hasn’t been successful. The minister had told a Senate ad hoc committee on ‘Promissory Note Programme and Bond Issuance’ that the terminal benefits of ex-Nigeria Airways workers would be paid through promissory notes and bonds issuance. “We have written to President Buhari to interfere in the matter so we can be paid” he said.
