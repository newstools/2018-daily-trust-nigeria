Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and Emir of Kano Sanusi Lamido Sanusi have appealed to Nigerians to respect the cultural differences of the country and tolerate one another. They spoke in Umuahia yesterday when they paid a courtesy visit to Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu. Ganduje was in the state to receive a chieftaincy title from the chairman of the South East Council of Traditional Rulers and chairman of Ndi Eze in Abia, Eze Eberechi Dick. Ganduje said the honour would enhance national integration, noting that Nigerians would do better if cultural and religious differences are understood and respected. Sanusi said that Kano remained the cosmopolitan centre of Nigeria as it had accommodated different people doing businesses. Ikpeazu stressed the need for every ethnic nationality in the country to respect each otherâ€™s differences.
