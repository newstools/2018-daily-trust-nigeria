Spain sent back to Morocco on Thursday 116 migrants who had stormed the border fence at its Ceuta enclave in North Africa the day before, a Spanish Interior Ministry spokesman said. Hundreds had attempted to get over the highly fortified border on Wednesday, and 118 made it to Spanish soil. Some of them threw a corrosive substance which left seven police officers with burns. Police identified the entire group and gave them legal and medical help before starting the process of expelling them, which the migrants accepted, the spokesman said, adding two will be allowed to stay because they are minors. The spokesman later added that the migrants had all been informed that they had the right to request asylum in Spain, but none accepted the offer to start the process. Amnesty International criticized the approach, saying in a statement: “Due to the speed at which it is carried out, it is difficult to guarantee access to a personalized procedure with full guarantees.”
