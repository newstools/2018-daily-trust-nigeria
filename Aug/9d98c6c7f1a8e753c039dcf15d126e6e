The Managing Director of the Comerel Travels and Tours Limited, Ustaz Abubakr Siddeeq Muhammad, said diversification of the nation’s economy from predominant oil will increase the number of intending pilgrims to perform the hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. He told Daily Trust yesterday on telephone during the 12th Hajj Induction 2018 course for intending pilgrims of the organisation, in Abuja, that the low patronage was due to the nation’s state of the economy. He said “In the life of every business, there is usually a moment when you experience low patronage as we are experiencing this year. This does not however reduce our standard that we are known for. NAHCON has been very supportive to us and others. One of the ways to ensure the return of high patronage is the diversification of the nation’s economy from relying on oil alone. “Private businesses should be further encouraged to help the government,” he said.
