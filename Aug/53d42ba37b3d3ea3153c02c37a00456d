The Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has unfrozen Benue State government's bank accounts  . The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom, Mr Terver Akase, confirmed the report to Channels Television in an interview on Thursday. DailyTrust reports that Benue state government accounts were frozen by the EFCC on Tuesday. Akase condemned the action noting that it was not wise to dislocate the state financially due to the security situation in Benue. “If EFCC freezes the accounts of any state government, Benue or anywhere else, I think it is unconstitutional, it is not right, because you are shutting down government. “Government must spend, more especially Benue where there are issues of insecurity.
