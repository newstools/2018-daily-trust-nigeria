The Jigawa State Deputy Governor, Barrister Ibrahim Hassan Hadejia, yesterday in Dutse, the state capital, formally declared his intention to contest for a senatorial seat in the 2019 general elections. Hadejia made the declaration before elders of the eight local government areas that make up Hadejia Emirate Council who paid him a courtesy call in government House, Dutse. The elders had approached him to declare for the seat. The leader of the delegation, Alhaji Umar Mohammed, Magayakin Hadejia, said the deputy governor was not just their son, butÂ  had represented the emirate for a long time very well without disappointing us. After the deputy governor announced his intention to vie for the senate seat, they pledged their total support and allegiance to him and promised to work for his success in the polls next year. He said the decision was in response to numerous calls by the elders and other APC supporters from his constituency. The deputy governor commended Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar for his support and cooperation towards making his tenure as deputy a success. He, however, pledged to maintain his loyalty in the governor and the APC towards its overall victory. Barrister Hassan Hadejia, who is the longest serving deputy governor in Nigeria, was commissioner of Justice and attorney-general, secretary to the state government and later deputy governor all during the Saminu Turaki administration in the state from 1999 to 2007. In the 2015 All Progressives Congress (APC) congresses, Barrister Hadejia won the governorship primaries, but was overturned overnight and the ticket handed over to the current Governor Badaru. On the joint ticket, he and Badaru won the governorship election in 2015.
