Jordan's army says its forces have killed several fighters belonging to ISIL to prevent them from crossing from southern Syria. Military units used "all types of weapons" to shell fighters who had come close to its side of the Yarmouk Valley in clashes that lasted nearly 20 hours from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon, an army source said. "We applied rules of engagement and members of the Daesh (the Arabic acronym for ISIL, also known as ISIS) gang were forced to retreat inside Syria and some of their members were killed," the source said.
