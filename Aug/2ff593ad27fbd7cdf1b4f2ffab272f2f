A former governor of Kaduna State and presidential aspirant of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in next year’s election, Senator Ahmed Makarfi, has warned the leadership of his party on the manner of  accommodating and integrating those that recently defected to the party in order to avoid an implosion. Makarfi spoke yesterday in Lokoja when he met leaders and stakeholders of the PDP in Kogi State to solicit their support for his presidential aspiration. He said the leadership must be wary of the mistake made when the PDP was handed over to Senator Ali Modu Sheriff. Makarfi said: “Everybody is welcome but we must be careful so we don’t give the impression that it doesn’t pay to be loyal. We must not create a situation whereby you have a home and you have a visitor and when the visitor comes, you give him a guest room to stay, then the next day, he wants the master’s bedroom and then the next day, you leave the home for him...does that happen?” “PDP must never allow that kind of thing to happen. Let them come in and enjoy the privileges but you must know what to give and what not to give,” Makarfi said. According to him, the PDP must get it right in choosing its presidential flag bearer and other candidates for the 2019 elections, adding, “It will be a great disaster not only for the PDP but entire Nigeria if we make that mistake.” Responding, the PDP chairman in the state, Engr. Sam Uhotu, assured Makarfi of support, saying the party would have been buried were it not for the efforts of the senator who came to rescue it.
