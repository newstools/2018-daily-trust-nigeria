A group, Host Communities of Nigeria Producing Oil and Gas/Minerals Resources, northern states area on Tuesday, called on the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) to prevail on the Federal Government to consider youths of the northern extraction in pipeline security. 

The leader of the group, Bishop Gabriel Simeon Ojoka, during a visit to the ACF office in Kaduna, said this will help in reducing some of the social vices currently ravaging the northern region and Nigeria as a whole.

While lamenting that too much attention was given to oil and gas, as well as the Niger Delta region without comesurate attention to mineral resources in the northern states, he urged the federal government to invest more on mineral resources in the North.

"Our coming here is to get the Arewa Consultative Forum, which is the voice of the North to prevail on the current Federal Government on the need to invest more on these mineral resources and the northern states," he said.

According to him, the highest number of unemployed youths and women are found in the northern states. 

"Despite the huge mineral resources deposits found in almost every remote village in all LGAs in the northern states, most communities do not know what is called 13 percent derivation from mineral resources nor development resulting from the mining activities taking place on their lands.

"For many years, these communities have been with no accessible roads, light, water and other amenities. Between April and May, 2015, 28 children in Kawo and Magiro, two remote villages in Niger state were mysteriously reported dead after suffering symptoms of convulsions, insomnia and hallucinations. It took the help of doctors without borders to discover that the children died of extremely high level of lead in their bodies," he lamented.

Responding, the acting chairman of ACF, Alhaji Liman Kwande said the forum was committed to making the North self sufficient.
