Some youths under the auspices of Sokoto State Students and Youth Forum yesterday said Governor Aminu Tambual’s administration had performed woefully in the area of youth development. Addressing journalists in Sokoto, the chairman of the group, Isa Usman, said youths and students in the state had no option than to support the All Progressives Congress and ensure its success in the 2019 general elections. Usman said that payment of scholarship and students’ allowances were not consistent under Tambuwal. He cited the recent threat by the Baze University to sack the students of the state brought from abroad to the university by the state government over non payment of school fees. He recalled what he called “unprecedented” commitment of former Governor Aliyu Wamakko to youth development, saying that during his administration, students’ allowances and scholarship were consistently and promptly paid. Usman further advised youths not to allow politicians to use them as thugs. The group declared support for President Muhammadu Buhari and Wamakko. In his reaction, Tambuwal, who dumped the APC for the Peoples Democratic Party last week, said the youth were only playing the script of their sponsored who, according to him, are enemies of his government. Tambuwal, who spoke through his media aide, Abubakar Shekara, however described the group’s allegations as false. The governor said his administration had spent N3bn on scholarship and students’ allowances in the last three years while attending to other aspects of the people’s needs. “So, for somebody to say that this government is not consistent in paying scholarship and students allowance, he is not saying the truth,” he said.
