Moroccoâ€™s ministerial council, chaired by King Mohammed VI, has approved a draft law that would reinstate compulsory military service. Women will be included in the military draft, which will oblige citizens under 25 to serve for a year. Conscription for men only was scrapped in 2006. The Moroccan authorities say it is being brought back to promote patriotism. Public reaction has been mixed. Some have welcomed the return of conscription, seeing it as a way to help tackle youth unemployment.
