The former vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jean-Pierre Bemba, has said he intends to stand for the presidency in elections due this December. Mr Bemba said as long as the election was transparent, he would abide by the result, rather than taking up arms as he did before. He plans to return to the Democratic Republic of Congo this week from Belgium after spending a decade in jail. He was freed after his war crimes conviction was quashed on appeal at the International Criminal Court. President Joseph Kabilaâ€™s government argues that Mr Bemba is not eligible to run for president because of a former corruption conviction but the ex-warlord is challenging this in court. Mr Bemba said he is ready to hold talks with the president. The long-delayed election is meant to choose a successor to Mr Kabila, whose second and final term in office ended two years ago.
