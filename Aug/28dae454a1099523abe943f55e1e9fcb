Macedonia would invest around 784,439 U.S. dollars in 2018 in kindergarten construction and adaptation, a 44 per cent increase on 2017, the Minister of Labour and Social Policy said on Monday. Mila Carovska, the minister, said at a press conference that more than 80 per cent of the investments are for rural municipalities, in order to achieve an equal regional development and equal opportunity for children from urban and rural areas. A total of 329,992 U.S. dollars, or 42 per cent of the budget, was spent in August. “This amount is almost the same as the amount invested for the whole year of 2015 and about 56,570 U.S. dollars more than the budget spent for this purpose in 2016,’’ said Carovska.
