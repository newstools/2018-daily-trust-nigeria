Family of late Chairman of the All Progressive Congress, (APC,), Barr. Enerst Odu, of Ezza North has distanced themselves from the recent protest over the death of their son. The protesters who were addressed by Chief of Staff government House, Abakaliki, Hon. Offorie Okore, called on Nigeria police to investigate the cause of his death.  But, Mr. Odu Sunday, elder brother of the deceased insisted that  the protest which happened on Thursday last week was carried out by purported members of the state Peoples Democratic Party.  He however cautioned those pointing accusing fingers on innocent people on social media and pages of newspapers to desist from such or face the wrath of the gods.  The elder brother of  the deceased made this known when Hon. Austine Igwe Edeze, APC chieftain and aspirant for 2019 Guber in the state, paid the family of late Barr. Udu a  condolence visit at their family compound in Abakaliki.  "We have no hand in the protest either were we informed before hand. So as a family we want to use this opportunity to call those behind the protest to order, death can come anytime irrespective of your age."  "So l don't see the reason why some unwanted elements in Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should use the opportunity to mock us, we are warning them to stop mocking the death and desist from pointing accusing fingers on innocent persons", he stressed.  Speaking earlier, Chief Edeze, who was visibly angry over the fake reports in social media including national dailies, condole the family.  "We are not God, His the giver and taker but those using the media houses to politicize the death of our beloved brother/ strong member of APC should stop or face the law of Karma. Those who accompanied Hon. Adeze to the visit were a house of representative aspirant for Ezza/lshielu Federal constituency in the forth coming 2019 election Mr. Mike Ifere and APC Ward chairman in the area Mr. Oshima Ekuma and others.
