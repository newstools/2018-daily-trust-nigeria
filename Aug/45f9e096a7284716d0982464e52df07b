Leaderships of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) and the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) have resolved to end the age-long inter-professional rivalry in the health sector. President of NMA, Dr. Francis Faduyile and its PSN counterpart, Pharm. Ahmed Yakasai made the declaration yesterday when the former led executive members of the association on a courtesy call to Pharm. House in Lagos. It was a frank session as the two major professional bodies in the health sector appraised the age-long rivalry which they agreed have drawn back the sector and even diverted attention from the germane issue of poor budgetary allocation by both Federal and state governments to the health sector. They however agreed to put in place committees to draw up a checklist of issues responsible for the rivalry and explore ways of jaw-jawing to resolve the problem with a view to improving healthcare delivery in the country. Both Yakasai and Faduyile agreed that the inter-professional friction has done more harm than good to the sector and declared it is high time they buried the hatchet for the good of the patients which both Doctors and Pharmacists and other healthcare providers have pledged their commitment to.
