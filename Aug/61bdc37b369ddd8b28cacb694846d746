The FCT Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS) has said it has put in place measures to stem fake documentation and registration of vehicles in the territory. DRTS director  Aliyu Bodinga, who stated this in an interview, reiterated the commitment of the directorate to safeguarding its database and equipment. Aliyu said the move would stop hackers from accessing its system. He said DRTS had tackled the menace of fake vehicle registration in the FCT. He implored motorists to always visit DRTS offices to renew their documents in order not to be victims of impostors. “Because our data base is secured and it’s difficult for somebody else to fake our documents such as vehicle licence, impersonators try to fake license from other places. But once they arrive the FCT, we use Abuja Auto Inspectors to detect them,” he said. Bodinga, while commenting on the forthcoming enforcement of installation of air condition in taxis in October, said the move was to enhance road worthiness of vehicles and not to impose hardship on motorists.
