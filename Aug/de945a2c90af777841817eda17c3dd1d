The Sokoto Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service has seized 68 cartons of tramadol and 120 kilogrammes of cannabis worth N21.1 million as well as six cartons of expired cigarettes. Speaking yesterday while handing over the seized items to the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency and the National Food and Drugs Administration Commission, the Area Comptroller, Nasiru Ahmed, asked border communities to see smuggling as dangerous to the society. He also stressed the need for stronger synergies between security agencies to curtail the menace. “Nigeria is our country and we need to double our effort to stop illicit drugs and firearms into our country,” he said. He said investigation is ongoing to unravel the owners of the seized items.
