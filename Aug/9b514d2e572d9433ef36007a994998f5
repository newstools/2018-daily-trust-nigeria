A former Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu has replied Senate President Bukola Saraki on his case at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), saying he has no case. Saraki had while reacting to an exclusive interview Adamu granted Daily Trust on Sunday, said he (Adamu) became the attack dog of the Presidency since the EFCC dusted his file on alleged case of corruption and also went ahead to arraign Adamu’s son in court. Reacting to Saraki’s allegation, Adamu who chairs the Senate committee on Agriculture said he told Saraki when his case was struck out at the court in 2016. “I think because he has come so much to talk about EFCC, he’s being dishonest about it. This is because when my case was terminated, when it was discharged, in the Federal High Court in Lafia, way back on June 28, 2016, as a senator, when I got back to Abuja, I went to him (Saraki) and told him that my case has been discharged. All the other accused persons were discharged. “He congratulated me. Of course it wasn’t for him to announce formally at plenary, but he congratulated me. There were other colleagues of mine I discussed the matter with. They knew about it. Each time they talk about Abdullahi Adamu, they say EFCC; I have no case with EFCC. I’ll give you the documents to see,” he said. Adamu made available to Daily Trust the ruling on his case by a Federal High Court in Lafia dated June 28, 2016 with reference number FHC/LF/CR/08/2010. The court presided over by Justice A. A. Okeke had while ruling on the application by the prosecution counsel struck out the case and discharged Adamu and the 11 other accused persons.
