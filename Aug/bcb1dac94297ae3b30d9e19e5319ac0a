The chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kuje Area Council, Alhaji Ismaila Yenche, said the party was not jittery over defections of some members to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the area. Yenche, who spoke with newsmen at the party’s secretariat on Saturday, while reacting to defections by some members of his party, said PDP was still fully on ground despite losing the last area council election to the ruling APC in 2016. He said the PDP was quite aware of some of its members that defected, saying such party members cannot even win their poling unit at any election in the council. According to him, PDP has been receiving decampees into its fold silently. He said the party was strategising ahead of next year’s council election, adding that the party shall emerge victorious with the calibre of APC stalwarts that have pitched their tent with the PDP in the area. Yenche added that the poor performances of the present APC led administration in the last two years has already put the PDP ahead of the ruling APC in the area.
