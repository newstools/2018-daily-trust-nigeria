A judge in Uganda has granted bail to popular musician-turned-politician Bobi Wine and 32 opposition politicians who are facing treason charges. They are accused of allegedly throwing stones at a vehicle in President Yoweri Museveni’s convoy earlier this month. Bobi Wine, affectionately known as the “ghetto president”, appeared on crutches in court. The army, who had detained him, denied reports that he had been beaten, calling the allegations “rubbish”.
