A Kuje Upper Area Court, Abuja, yesterday sentenced a 30-year-old carpenter to three monthsâ€™ imprisonment for stealing a motorcycle valued at N180, 000. Luka Musa, who resides at Anguwan Gade Area of Kuje, was convicted on a two-count charge of breach of trust and theft. The judge, Abdullahi Abdulkareem, gave the judgment after Musa pleaded guilty to the offences and begged for leniency. Abdulkareem, however, gave him an option of N50, 000 fine. The judge remarked that cases of motorcycle theft were rampant, and hoped that the sentence would serve as deterrent to others. Earlier, the prosecutor, Doris Okoroba, told the court that one Emeka Okafor of Paseli area reported the case at the Kuje Police Station on August 20. The prosecutor said the complainant gave the accused his motorcycle for hire on an agreement of weekly returns. Okoroba said Musa absconded with the motorcycle and was seen at Lugbe Area after three weeks. She said the complainant raised an alarm on sighting Musa, and the accused was consequently apprehended and handed over to the police. The prosecutor said Musa admitted during investigation that he committed the offences in contravention of sections 186 and 326 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
