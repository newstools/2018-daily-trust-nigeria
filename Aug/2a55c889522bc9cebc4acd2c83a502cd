A six-year old girl died when a fence came down on her at New Kutunku, Gwagwalada. The incident, which happened when the girl was  said to have gone to ease herself behind their neighbour’s fence after a torrential rainfall at about 5pm on Friday, has left the residents shaken and sad. The girl, Hafsat Nuhu, died of injuries she sustained from the incident. A resident, Yusuf Ahmad, said the deceased was with her father when she felt the need to urinate and picked a kettle of water to purify herself afterwards. “Part of the fence collapsed on her, he said. “It was her scream that attracted people inside the house to the scene. She was removed from under the rubble and taken to hospital, but the hospital referred them to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, where she was confirmed dead by doctors,” he said. She has been buried according to Islamic rites. He said the funeral prayer was led by the Chief Imam of New Kutunku Central Mosque, Malam Yusuf Mshebwa, adding that the case was not reported to the police due to the nature of the death.
