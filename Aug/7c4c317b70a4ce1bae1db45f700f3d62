The Plateau State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday said it had uncovered a plan by the Governor Simon Lalong administration to forcefully and illegally shut down some media houses in the state. In a statement yesterday by the state PDP Publicity Secretary, John Telpark  Akans,  the party said it was reliably informed that the plan which was at the instigation of Governor Lalong, was in partnership with external forces hostile to the people of the state. “Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State through his Commissioner for Information, Mr Yakubu Datti, in line with the dictatorial policies of the All Progressive Congress (APC) have called on the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to shut down some media stations/outlets  in the state, for what he (Datti) claimed as ‘unprofessional conduct’. We, at this point call on the Federal Government through its agency, the NBC to also note that, this plot, if carried out, will be in defiance of people’s rights and freedom of speech. It called on Plateau people to reject the plan and the dictatorial policies Lalong and the APC are desperately seeking to impose on plateau, adding that the governor and his party must abide by the tenets of the principles of rule of law/people’s rights and decent freedom of expression, particularly now that the nation is heading into the 2019 general elections. There was no immediate reaction from the government.
