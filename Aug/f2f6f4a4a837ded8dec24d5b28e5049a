The Kebbi State House of Assembly yesterday refused to confirm the appointment of the state’s Acting Chief Judge, Justice Asabe Karatu, over an allegation that she altered her primary school certificate. The motion for her rejection was moved by House Leader Bello Yakubu, representing Birnin Kebbi South Constituency and was seconded by Hamza Bello from  Danko/Wasagu West Constituency. Speaker Abdulmumin Kamba said the house would not clear any nominee with an altered certificate. He said: “This honorable house will not clear any nominee who comes before it with altered credentials. It is now left for the government to decide on whom to send as a nominee to the house.”
