Saudi Arabia barred all citizens from receiving medical treatment in Canada as a diplomatic dispute over criticism of its human rights record intensifies. Riyadh also announced it is coordinating the transfer of all Saudi patients from Canadian hospitals to other medical facilities outside Canada, the Saudi press agency SPA reported on Wednesday. The Gulf state stopped sending patients to Canadian hospitals “according to directives by the leadership,” it said. It was unclear how many Saudi patients would be affected by the decision. Saudi Arabia expelled Canada’s ambassador, recalled its own envoy, and cut trade ties with Canada after it publicly denounced a crackdown on rights activists in the Gulf kingdom on Twitter.
