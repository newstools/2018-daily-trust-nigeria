The Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo, on Monday met behind closed doors with the Senate Leader, Ahmed Lawan, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.

Lawan was accompanied to the meeting by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Ita Enang.

The meeting may not be unconnected with the call that the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, must vacate his seat having defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party.

Again, the Presidency has been calling on the National Assembly to cut short its ongoing vacation in order to attend to important national issues including the budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission.
