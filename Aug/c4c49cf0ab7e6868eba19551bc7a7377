Former Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar has called on politicians to always play by the rules and shun do-or-die politics for the country’s democracy to advance. Fielding questions from newsmen at the Minna Central mosque shortly after theEid el Kabir prayers yesterday, the former leader said Nigeria’s political space was being needlessly heated up by politicians, adding that enduring political culture can only be built when politicians adhere to the rules of the game. He said it was pertinent that politician understand that leadership comes from God and He bestows same on whomever He wishes, adding that with such understanding, the prevailing issue of do-or-die politics should not arise. He said the 2019 general elections would be a test case that Nigeria democracy has come of age, asking Nigerians to put aside their differences by ensuring hitch-free polls. He urged Muslims to imbibe the exemplary life style of Prophet Muhammad and the lessons of Eid el Kabir by living in peace with people of other faiths. Niger State Deputy Governor Ahmed Mohammed Ketso called on those who registered in the just concluded Continuous Voters Registration exercise by the Independent Electoral Commission to obtain their Permanent Voters Cards to enable them to elect credible leaders of their choice in 2019. The Chief Imam of Minna Central Mosque, Mal Isa Fari, enjoined Muslim faithful to internalize and practise the innate and core lessons of the festival which, according to him, essentially reinforces the spirit of sacrifice, tolerance, sympathy, empathy, devotion to duty, and the promotion of harmonious coexistence. He also enjoined wealthy Muslims to assist the needy and vulnerable in the spirit of love and brotherhood that Islam stands for.
