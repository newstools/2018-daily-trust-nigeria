The Igbo Leaders of Thought (ILT) have appealed to President Mohammadu Buhari to quickly set up a Constituent Assembly that will fashion out a new constitution for the country before the 2019 general elections. In a communiqué released after their meeting in Enugu on Tuesday, the group said the appeal became necessary following the alleged general rejection of the 1999 constitution, noting that the observed faults in the constitution would continue to affect election outcomes if not checked. The group deplored the rate of killings in the country, insisting that it had assumed genocidal proportions and placed the country as a “failed state”, while also asking the federal government to immidiately address the situation before the next elections. The Igbo leaders called for the immediate de-proscription of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). They noted that members of the organization do not carry arms but engages in protests; a development they added, was within their legitimate rights.
