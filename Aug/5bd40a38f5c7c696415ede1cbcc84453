Senate President Bukola Saraki yesterday met behind closed doors with former Military President General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida at his hill top mansion in Minna for over two hours. It was learnt that the meeting was on the Tuesday’s invasion of the National Assembly by Department of State Service operatives. The meeting was also said to have discussed the defection of some lawmakers, including the senate president from the All Progressives Congress  to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Saraki shunned journalists who sought to ask him about his mission to Babangida’s residence. Babangida’s security aides had earlier told journalists that Saraki’s visit was private.
