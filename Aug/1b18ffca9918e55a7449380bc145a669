Telecommunication customers have tasked the Nigerian Communication Commission and service providers to device means of assisting security agencies in tackling insecurity. They made the suggestion weekend at the  97th edition of Consumer Outreach Programme in Sokoto. Some of the speakers at the occasion lamented how attackers were coordinating their activities using facilities of service providers. “They are using your facilities to coordinate their activities and there is no way they can be traced,” one of the customers and human rights activist, Nura Attajiri,said. According to him, many people have lost their lives because of bandits’ attacks, particularly in the northwest. Earlier, Director, NCC Consumer Affairs Bureau, Felicia Onwuegbuchulam, said the programme was to enable a tripartite meeting between the regulators, operators and consumers with a view to resolving pressing  consumer issues with respect to provision of telecom services. “As the commission has been inundated with various complaints such over unsolicited text messages, calls and failure to roll over unused data at the expiration of data bundle among others,” she said.
