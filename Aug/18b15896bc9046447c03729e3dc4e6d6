Nigeria’s Ambassador to South Africa, Malam Ahmed Ibeto, has also re-joined the PDP yesterday. A former deputy governor to ex-governor of Niger State, Dr Muazu Babangida Aliyu, Ibeto registered as PDP member at his Ibeto ward, Magama Local Government Area, yesterday. He was presented with the party’s membership card immediately after the registration ceremony which was witnessed by many party supporters and loyalists. Daily Trust recalled that Ibeto left PDP for the APC few months to the 2015 general elections following disagreement with his boss, Dr Aliyu. He was to be compensated with a ministerial slot but his name was said to have been dropped and later nominated and appointed as Nigeria’s Ambassador to South Africa by President Muhammadu Buhari. It was learnt that Ibeto arrived Nigeria from Pretoria on Sunday and handed over his letter of resignation at the Ministry of External Affairs on Monday. The Zonal Vice Chairman of the PDP for Zone C, Yahaya Abdullahi Ability, confirmed the defection of the former deputy governor to Daily Trust on phone.
