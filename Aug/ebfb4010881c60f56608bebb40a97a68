The Abuja Zonal Coordinator of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Dr Theophilus Lagi has called on Acting President Yemi Osinbajo, to call Oyo and Osun state governments to order over the plight of academic staff of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomosho. Briefing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, Lagi said the poor conditions of staff and students at the institution had been due to total neglect in terms of funding by Oyo and Osun state governments. “This situation in LAUTECH is so dire and needs the intervention of well meaning Nigerians to impress on the two visitors to this university to search their conscience and do what is expected of them, to give priority to university education in their respective states,” he said. While noting that gross underfunding in LAUTECH has adverse effect on the development of the university, Lagi said the gradual decay in infrastructure in the university was alarming, saying the university looked like ‘glorified’ secondary school.
