Suspected gang members on Sunday evening went on rampage in Malali, Kaduna North Local Government Area of Kaduna state, attacking residents. The gang members, Daily Trust gathered, were protesting the killing of their colleague on Friday during a burial in the area. The attackers believed to be from Badarawa, attacked residents of Unguwan Gado in Malali area of the state. It will be recalled that the state government had imposed a 7pm to 7am curfew in the two communities after two youths were killed on Friday in a communal clash in Kwaru and Ungwan Yero of Kaduna North Local Government Area. A resident of the area, Fatima Isa, said the gang members came in revenge of the killing of one of its members. â€œWe were going about our business when we saw people running. We did not realise what was happening until we heard shots fired by security personel. The youth from Kwaru came into Ungwan Yero in Malali and started causing trouble." She said if not for the timely intervention of security agencies who came in and brought the clash under control, it would have been a different story. When contacted, Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Yakubu Sabo Abubakar, confirmed the incident. He said armed policemen were on ground to ensure security of lives and property. He said the curfew has been reviewed to 24hours by the state government.
