There was pandemonium when some residents of Ibadan besieged a radio station owned by the popular gospel singer, Yinka Ayefele, to protest against the state government’s plan to demolish the property. Oyo State Government issued a three-day notice for demolition of the radio station, for allegedly contravening town planning law of the state. Ayefele has approached the state’s High Court to stop the demolition but there are fears the state government was going ahead with the demolition. The director of Yinka Ayefele Nigeria Limited, Mr. David Ajiboye, told reporters at the music house that the company had urged the court to restrain the defendant from the planned demolition. The property is situated at plot 11A and 11B along link ring road to Lagos express road, Ibadan, Oyo State.
