Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, has accused the Executive arm of government of treating the 2019 general elections as emergency.

He said this during a meeting of the leadership of both chambers of the National Assembly with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu.



“As leaders of the National Assembly, we are committed to appropriating whatever is needed within the confines of the resources of the nation for INEC to be able to actualise this and that is why this meeting is important.

"
However, personally, I have some questions that I intend to raise, but I will raise these in the process of discussion because it appears that we are treating this 2019 election as an emergency, which it ought not to be so, that is just my concern.”


The INEC chairman Professor Yakubu, on his part, thanked the leadership of the National Assembly for their continued support.
