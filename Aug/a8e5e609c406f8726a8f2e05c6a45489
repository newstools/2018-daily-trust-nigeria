The European Heads of Missions in Nigeria have commended the federal government for taking swift action against the blockade of the National Assembly by the operatives of the Department of State Services. The envoys, in a statement issued by the EU delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS on Thursday, reiterated the importance of Nigerian law enforcement agencies to staying neutral and ensuring that independent institutions operate without interference. The statement said, “The EU Heads of Missions have noted with concern recent examples of interference in the democratic process by law enforcement services – the most recent case being the barring of access to the National Assembly on August 7. “The EU is fully committed to supporting democracy in Nigeria, and it commends the Federal Government’s swift action to protect the independence of the National Assembly as a critical pillar of democracy. “The EU reiterates the importance of all law enforcement services staying neutral and ensuring that independent institutions can operate in line with their constitutional mandates, free from interference and intimidation. “The upcoming general elections in 2019 are vital in ensuring national stability, peace and prosperity for all Nigerians. “It is for the Nigerian people to decide the outcome of the elections, and the EU calls upon all stakeholders in Nigeria to play their part so that voters can make their decision through a free, fair, credible and peaceful election process.”
