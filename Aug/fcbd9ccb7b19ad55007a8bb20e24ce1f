A fierce fight allegedly between two rival gangsters Friday claimed the lives of nine people in Tse-Ujoh in Ikyurav-Tiev community of Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. Daily Trust gathered that the notorious gangsters had been operating around the Sankera axis of the state which consisted of three local government areas of Kastina-Ala, Ukum and Logo. Locals told our correspondent that the gangsters had often in recent times engaged themselves in supremacy battle for the criminal control of the area and that the same groups were responsible for the killing of many people early last year at the popular yam market in ZakiBiam of Ukum LGA. The locals alleged that the latest killings were occasioned by the resignation of a member of the gang from the nucleus body so that he could operate in isolation, a development said to have angered his other colleagues who insisted that he remained part of them even after the former had surrendered weapons in his possession to them. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Moses Yamu, confirmed the incident. Yamu said the attack was carried out on the community on Thursday by some armed outlaws who had been terrorising the vicinity, adding that eight people were confirmed dead by that evening while the ninth person who was receiving treatment in the hospital died yesterday. He said further investigation into the matter had began.
