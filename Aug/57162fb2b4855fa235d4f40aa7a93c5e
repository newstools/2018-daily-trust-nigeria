Nine youth corps members have drowned in River Mayo Selbe in Gashaka Local Government Area of Taraba State. Daily Trust gathered that 22 corps members went to the river to swim on Saturday when the incident happened. The police public relations officer Taraba State Police Command, ASP David Misal, who confirmed the incident, said “Information at our disposal reveals that 22 youth corps members serving in the state were on a picnic party in River Mayo-Selbe in Gashaka LGA on Saturday when the incident happened.” He confirmed that nine out of 22 corps members died while the villagers rescued 13. ASP Misal further stated that seven corpses had been recovered while search for the remaining two corpses continued. He said the youth corps members were swimming in the river when the volume of water increased, which carried the victims away. The NYSC state Coordinator, Mrs Florence Yaakugh, also confirmed the incident. She disclosed that the seven bodies have been recovered while the search for the other two bodies was still ongoing by the locals in collaboration with security agencies and the NYSC. “So far, seven bodies have been recovered and we are working with other relevant persons to recover the rest and to identify the persons,” she said. She said the NYSC would soon have the identity of all the Corps members involved and make such known appropriately. “This is a very sad development and the entire NYSC family in Taraba state is already thrown into deep mourning,” she said.
