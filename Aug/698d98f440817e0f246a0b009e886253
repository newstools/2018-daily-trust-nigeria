Nigerians should rise against increase in subscription rates by cable pay TV operator, DSTV, to forestall indiscriminate price increase in the future, two Abuja based lawyers, Okonache Ogar and Patrick Abang have said.  The lawyers in a letter sent to media houses, said Nigerians needed to ask DSTV the reasons why it increased its subscription rates.  “As a people, it seems we are incapable of sustaining a fight against our oppressors. And, this we reckon is principally the reason why undertakings like MultiChoice and few others that enjoy dominant market positions keep taking us for granted even though they make the most money from us. The simple deduction is that, in Nigeria, unlike in other climes, the Customer is Not the King but a Pawn, to be exploited, derided and manipulated at will’’, the letter said.  The lawyers called on all Nigerians to demand that MultiChoice Nigeria suspends its price increase and revert to the old rates with immediate effect.  They also said MultiChoice Nigeria as a matter of urgency should introduce, within four months, pay-as-you-watch package as it is the practice in other countries.  They added that MultiChoice Nigeria should also introduce pay per channel view option within 4 (Four) months.   They said Nigerians should mount sustained campaign calling for the boycott of further subscriptions to the services of MultiChoice Nigeria if their demands for price slash and others are not meant.
