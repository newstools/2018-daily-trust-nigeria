Women across Africa, under the aegis of African Women Intercultural Dialogue (AWID), are to discuss issues relating to human trafficking, sex slavery, among others at a summit slated for September 25 in Abuja. Cookey Chinaka Iwuoha, the Programme Coordinator, said the summit was to provide “a policy briefing insight to re-think socially transmitted beliefs, knowledge, customs, skills, memes and languages that unconsciously support the dis-empowering place of women in developing societies and weakens women’s social capital in Africa.” Organisers said the summit has already been endorsed by the UN Women Nigeria, United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNECSO), International Organisation for Migration -UN Migration Agency, National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and National Center for Women Development (NCWD).
