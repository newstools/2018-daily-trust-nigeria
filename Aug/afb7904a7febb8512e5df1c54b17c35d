The Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, yesterday, said only a popular candidate will be fielded to fly the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) flag in the 2019 general elections so as to defeat President Muhammadu Buhari. Gov. Dickson also charged the members of the PDP to work together in order to build a cohesive and united party, rather than engaging in anti-party activities that could undermine their fortune. Dickson, who made the call at a consultative meeting with stakeholders of the PDP at the Government House, Yenagoa, added that anti-party posturing could affect the chances of the PDP in next year’s elections.
