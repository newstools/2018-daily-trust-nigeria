Five persons have been confirmed killed following a violent clash between members of two rival cult groups around Rafiki area, along the Rukuba road in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. Operation Safe Haven yesterday confirmed that two persons were critically injured in the clash which occurred around 8:30pm on Tuesday. This was barely three months after 12 people lost their lives in a similar cult clash around Gada Biyu in Jos north, less than three kilometers from Rafiki area. The new OPSH Commander, Major-General Augustine Agundu, told journalists that troops from sector 1 had responded to a distress call in the area, but on arrival, had discovered that the attack was caused by rival miscreants. He said: “Young men who have decided to take the part of lawlessness and in their lawless outing, they were able to engage themselves so ferociously that resulted in some deaths and that is an act that we are actually condemning in its entirety.” He said the Special Task Force was working with other security agencies to ensure that such incidents did not reoccur, stressing that “we are going to carry out deliberate operations to clear some these areas and locations to allow law abiding citizens to carry out their responsibilities.” The state police command said contrary to insinuation, the attack was not carried out by Fulani herdsmen, but was a cult clash carried in an isolated area. Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Tyopev Terna, said four persons were killed on the hills; while another person was killed in his vehicle. A security personnel attached to Operation Safe Haven said shells of AK47 ammunition, wraps of Indian hemp and bottles of illicit drinks were recovered from the scene.
