Police authorities in Kano have beefed up security around the state deputy governor, Professor Hafiz Abubakar, following a complaint of alleged threat to his life. The Police Public Relations Officer, Magaji Musa Majia, told Daily Trust yesterday that necessary measures had been taken to protect the deputy governor’s life. He said: “As number two citizen, the deputy governor deserves protection from us. So, we have deployed more security personnel to his residence and convoy and we have placed another team of undercover security operatives around him for effective surveillance.” The Police Public Relations Officer of Kano Zone One Headquarters, DSP Muhammad Sambo Sokoto, said the office of the Assistant Inspector-General of Police had been copied with the petition. The deputy governor had petitioned the police and State Security Service over an alleged threat to his life and plans to impeach him. Abubakar, an associate of Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, had in his petition, alleged that the state government had released funds to mobilise youths from the 44 local government areas of the state to protest against his stay in office. But the Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, described the allegations as baseless and unfounded, saying“It is laughable for the deputy governor to even think that he has the political clout that warrants mobilizing youths to stage a protest against him. Government will not waste its money in doing that.”
