An Ikeja chief magistrate’s court yesterday remanded a driver, Emmanuel Okafor, in Kirikiri Prisons for allegedly assaulting a minor sexually. The chief magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, refused the plea of the 35-year-old accused person for bail and ordered that he should stay in prison until when the case would be heard again in court. The prosecutor, Sergeant Raphael Donny, told the court that on July 30, 2018, the accused, who resides in the same house with the four-year-old child, took her to the back of the house and allegedly assaulted her sexually. Donny said, “He was fingering the girl’s private part when her cry attracted other occupants and they traced where the crying was coming from. They caught the accused in the act and apprehended him before he could run away.” The matter was adjourned till August 22, 2018 for mention.
