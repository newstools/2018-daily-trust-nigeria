She also pledged her commitment to the success of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state and across the country in the 2019 elections.

The declaration came immediately after her brother dumped the APC and returned to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

In a message sent to our correspondent, Gbemisola, who is the Chairman, Governing Council of Federal University of Otuoke, Bayelsa state, said she would soon galvanize all her supporters and associates to begin a re-election campaign for Buhari.

The message read in full: "I maintain my unwavering support for President Muhammadu Buhari, now and for his re-election in 2019, and for the success of our party, the APC, in Kwara State and across the federation.

"All members of my political organisations including GRS Movement (GRSM); GRS Foundation (GRSF); GRS Friends on Facebook (GRSFOF); Paramount Women Forum (PWF) and GRS Grassroots Youth Movement (GRS-GYM) will begin to implement the first phase of our "Get-Out-The-Vote for PMB and APC.
