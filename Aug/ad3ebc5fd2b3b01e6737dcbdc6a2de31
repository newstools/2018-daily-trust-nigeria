A group, the Arewa Solidarity Front, ASF, has written to the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole to ensure the APC reclaims the position of Senate President by replacing Senator Bukola Saraki with Senator Godswill Akpabio. ASF in the letter signed by its chairman, Haruna Abdullahi Maikano, said Akpabio has shown that he is a true nationalist with strong democratic credentials who has friends across the nation’s geo-political divide. The group said it cannot fold its arms and watch a few try to truncate democracy and harm what is of interest to the entire country by going against what is acceptable in a democratic setting stressing that after following what is happening in the National Assembly for some time, it has come to the conclusion that retaining the current leadership of the Senate would be harmful to the polity. “We make bold to say that it is unacceptable to allow the incumbent Senate President to continue to ridicule the president and the country’s international image with avoidable controversies over budgets and clearance of federal government’s appointees,” the ASF stated. In the letter, the group called on the national headquarters of the APC to prevail on the Senate to take appropriate democratic steps by pushing for the emergence of another as Senate President who they say will be willing to join hands with the president in moving Nigeria forward. “Our efforts have reached advanced stage, to secure a minimum of 2 million authentic signatures in favour of the vote of no-confidence on Saraki by Nigerian voters,” the ASF said adding that at the end of the exercise, it intends to meet with all the senators in their immediate constituencies in Northern Nigeria to further drum up support for Akpabio.
