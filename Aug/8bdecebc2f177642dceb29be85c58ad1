US President Donald Trump said that Israel will pay a “high price” in any peace talks in return for the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem in May. Speaking at a rally in the US state of West Virginia, Trump called the decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem “very big”. He said that in return, Palestinians will “get something very good because it’s their turn next.” The President did not put forward any concrete suggestions as to what this “something very good” might entail for the Palestinians.President Trump also remarked that the US had “taken Jerusalem off the table.” He added “if there’s ever going to be peace with the Palestinians, then this was a good thing to have done in past negotiations, they never got past Jerusalem becoming the capital. So I said ‘let’s take it off the table’,” the Times of Israel reported.(NAN)
