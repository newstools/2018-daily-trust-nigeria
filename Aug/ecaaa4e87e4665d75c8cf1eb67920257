The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has enjoined Nigerians, particularly Muslims, to imbibe spirits of Godliness, tolerance, perseverance and sacrifice as the prerequisites for peaceful co-existence in the country. In his Sallah message to Nigerians, signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak, in celebration of this year’s Eid-il-Kabir festival, Obasa asked Nigerians to imbibe the spirit that Prophet Ibrahim, his son Ismail and wife Hajarat displayed in their joint decision to sacrifice Ismail to keep the covenant the Prophet had with God while looking for a child. “They did not waiver in their belief in God. They persevered in the face of the difficulty posed by the decision to sacrifice their only child. The son was tolerant enough to present himself for sacrifice. These are the qualities we needed to engender peaceful co-existence in Nigeria: Godliness, perseverance and tolerance,” Obasa said. Noting that Nigeria was a group of people with different tribal and religious backgrounds, the Speaker stressed that the people should, nevertheless, be committed to achieving a common purpose. “We must eradicate every form of rancour and discord among us. We must understand and respect our differences, and tolerate one another in order to maintain peace and security of life and property,” he said. Obasa, who noted that the spirit of Eid-el-Kabir extolled the virtue of sacrifice, also enjoined Nigerians to rededicate themselves to national service in order to build the kind of great nation they desired. While commending the people for supporting the All Progressives Congress at all levels of government, the Lagos Speaker, who is the Chairman of Conference of Nigerian Speakers, urged them to patiently await the fulfilment of all the promises made to them. “The government is committed to serving the people sincerely and ensuring that everyone enjoys the dividends of democracy,” he said.
