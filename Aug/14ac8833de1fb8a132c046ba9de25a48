The National Economic Council (NEC) yesterday said states owe the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) N41 billion in Value Added Tax (VAT). Jigawa state Governor Abubakar Badaru disclosed this at the end of the NEC meeting presided over by Acting President Yemi Osinbajo at the State House Villa, Abuja. Badaru said the chairman of the FIRS, Babatunde Fowler disclosed this while briefing the council. “He informed the states what their positions are and the outstanding due to the states of about N41bn. He believes the states have to pay. He came up also with new technique and system that will help automatic collection of taxes both VAT and withholding tax. I think the states take and are willing to pay their outstanding," he said. He said the council was also told that from January to date, about N40bn was remitted from the states. “This has a significant increase compared to what happened last year,’’ he said.
