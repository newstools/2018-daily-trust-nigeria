The Emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II has appealed to politicians to abhor violence in their quest for power, stressing that there is more that unite Nigerians across various shades of divides beyond the game of politics. Speaking on Thursday in the Kano state government house during his Sallah durbar, Hawan Nassarawa, the royal father called on Nigerians to obtain their permanent votersâ€™ cards so as to be able to exercise their franchise in the forth-coming general elections. He also urged them to enroll for the national identity card. He lamented over the lackadaisical attitude of the people towards obtaining the national identity card which he said is very important for any Nigeria citizen. While commending the Kano state government over its achievements in the health sector, Sanusi cautioned the residents of Kano metropolis against indiscriminate dumping of refuse on the water ways. He charged them to ensure regular clearing of drainages with a view to avoid the imminent danger of flood disaster in the state. In his address, Kano state Governor Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje reiterated the commitment of his administration to the infrastructural development of the state, emphasing that all capital projects it started across the 44 local government areas would be completed before the year runs out. He said his administration would continue to invest in quality education at all levels, as it remained paramount to the development of the state.
