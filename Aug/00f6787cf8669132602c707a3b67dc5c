The Peoples Democratic Party( PDP) has lost one of its National Executive Committee (NEC) member from Kwara State, Ahmed Yinka Aluko, to the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC). Aluko, who ran in the 2015 elections as Deputy Governorship candidate on the PDP platform, resigned his elective position and membership during yesterdayâ€™s NEC meeting. The former Special Adviser on Security Matters in Kwara accused the opposition of impunity and undemocratic practices. Aluko said he was displeased by the decision of the PDP national leadership to hand over the structure of the PDP to Senate President Bukola Saraki, who defected on Tuesday to the party.
