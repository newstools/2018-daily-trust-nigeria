The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has said it arrested a total of 4,983 offenders for 6,097 offences committed nationwide during the just-concluded Eid-el Kabir special patrol operations it conducted. In a statement signed on Tuesday by the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, it stated that the most prevalent offence recorded during the period was Seatbelt Use Violation as 1,540 offenders were apprehended by the corps. It added that a total of 102 persons were arraigned by the Mobile Court within the special patrol period compared to 218 persons in 2017; while 99 offenders were convicted compared to 208 in 2017, and 3 persons were discharged and acquitted. It also noted that within the period, it engaged 1,761 drivers nationwide in a free and voluntary Eye Test exercise. “Out of the total number of 1,761 drivers tested by the optometrists, 350 drivers were discovered to have sight defects while 35 drivers went home with free eye glasses. “The eye test which lasted from Friday 17 to Sunday 26 Aug. 2018 was successfully carried out in collaboration with Optometrists Association across the country,” the corps noted. It further added that the corps has renewed its commitment towards creating a safer motoring environment in Nigeria. The corps spokesman quoted the Corps Marshal, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, saying the Corps now has a wider coverage due to the establishment of more FRSC Commands, Outposts, road side clinics and Zebra points who now feed in reports from different routes that were hitherto not thoroughly covered. He said the increase in number of road crashes, increase in the number of persons involved, and increase in the number of persons killed is due to the reports that emanated from the new FRSC formations. It will be recalled that the Corps Marshal had earlier directed that the 2018 Sallah special patrol cover 45 corridors which include but not limited to Sokoto-Tambuwal-Jega-Birnin Kebbi; Mokwa-Birnin Yero-Zaria; Maiduguri-Biu-Numan-Jalingo-Wukari; Akwanga-Lafiya-Makurdi; Jos-Bauchi-Gombe; Katsina-Kano-Wudil-Dutse-Azare-Potiskum, Kaduna-Saminaka-Jos, and Abuja-Kaduna-Kano. “In the same vein, the Corps recorded a significant increase in the number of people rescued without injury during the 2018 Eid-el-Kabir Sallah special patrol operations. “During the special operations, a total of 612 persons were rescued without injury as against 552 persons in the same period in 2017 representing 10.87% increase. Accordingly, the increase was as a result of improved patrol operations. “Total number of persons rescued with injuries in road traffic crashes during the 2018 Sallah celebration period was 397 compared to 400 in 2017, representing a decrease by 0.75%. “In addition, from the total number of 118 crashes, 63 were fatal compared to 79 in 2017 which represents 20% decrease in total number of people killed; 61 were serious  compared to 83 in 2017 which represents 26.51% decrease; and a total of 26 were minor crashes compared to 22 in 2017 which represents 18.18% increase. “Of the 1072 persons involved in road traffic crashes during the 2018 Sallah special patrol operation, 213 vehicles were involved compared to 221 in 2017, and 63 persons lost their lives in 2018 compared to 79 in 2017. “A total of 201 animals were also involved in crashes in 2018 as against 2 in 2017. “The breakdown of vehicles involved in road traffic crashes across the nation was as follows: 18 Tanker/Trailers, 21 Trucks, 37 Buses, 89 Cars, 29 motorcycles, 10 Tricycles, 9 pickups, and 201 animals. “Further to that, a total of 4 crashes claimed at least for lives during the period; these crashes occurred in Kantagora on the 20th August, 2018 claiming 11 lives, another occurred in Wudil on the same day claiming 7 lives.

Kazeem said “the positive changes in the reduction of offences and offenders, impoundments, and arraignments captured above is attributable to increase in Public Enlightenment, Enforcement, Traffic control, cooperation from Stakeholders, and the fully automated process of obtaining Drivers licence which ensures that Motorists must be trained in Driving Schools before they are qualified to apply for their Licences.”
