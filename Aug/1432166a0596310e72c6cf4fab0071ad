A motorway bridge has collapsed in the northwest Italian city of Genoa, killing at least 35 people as vehicles plummeted to the ground, emergency services say. Dramatic video footage captured the moment of the disaster when one of the huge supporting towers crashed down during torrential rain. Vehicles and debris fell 45m (148ft) on to rail tracks, buildings and a river. Rescuers are trying to free people caught in crushed vehicles or rubble. Fears that other parts of the bridge might fall have prompted the evacuation of buildings in the area, a rescuer told Italy’s Ansa news agency. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini promised that anyone found to be responsible for the bridge collapse would be held to account. “I have crossed that bridge hundreds of times,” he said. “Now, as an Italian citizen, I will do everything to get the names and surnames of the managers responsible, past and present, because it is unacceptable to die like that in Italy.”
