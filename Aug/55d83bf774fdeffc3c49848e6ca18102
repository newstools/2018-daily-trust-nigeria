Anyone found guilty of acts or intents that aid and abet terrorism in Nigeria shall spend at least 25 years in jail with no option of a fine, says National Assembly’s Counter Terrorism (Prevention and Prohibition) Bill 2018. In addition to the establishment of National Counter Terrorism Centre to coordinate anti- terrorism efforts, the bill recommends 25-year jail term for all physical acts and intents of terrorism, terrorists’ meetings, provision of instructions or training for terrorists, harbouring or hindering arrest of terrorists, concealing information about terrorists, among others. Chairman, House Committee on National Security and Intelligence, Aminu Sani Jaji (APC, Zamfara), who gave the insight in Abuja yesterday, while briefing newsmen at the National Assembly Joint Committee on Counter Terrorism Retreat, said the essence of the bill was to bring Nigeria at par with international best practices on counter terrorism. “Nigeria has one of the highest frequency of terrorist activities in the world. Hence, we recommend that there should be a centre headed by a director with trained personnel to ensure effective coordination of counter terrorism efforts,” he said. While assuring that the bill would be passed once the lawmakers resume from recess, and thereafter sent to the Senate for concurrence, Jaji said the bill had taken care of all global anti-terrorism charters in which Nigeria is a signatory. He also dismissed fears that the intended centre for counter terrorism would duplicate functions of other security outfits, saying “the functions of the counter terrorism centre will be complementary.” Dr Saidu Abdullahi Danwanka, one of the resource persons at the retreat said the bill had a comprehensive legal framework that prohibits acts of terrorism with adequate penalties for such acts, saying “Ignorance of the law is no excuse” given the federal government’s commitment to counter terrorism. The two-day retreat drew stakeholders from the intelligence and security circles such as the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Department of State Security (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and academics.
