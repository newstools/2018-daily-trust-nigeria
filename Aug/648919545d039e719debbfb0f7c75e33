A vacation judge, Justice Emmanuel Ogundare, at a Lagos High Court, Igbosere yesterday, granted the application of bail of five Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members accused of murder. The five members are Rotimi Kujore, Ismaila Abiola, Kehinde Fasasi, Fatai Adele and Amos Fawole. The court granted the prayers and adjourned the hearing of the motion ex-parte to August 23, 2018. Earlier, the defendants’ counsel, Mr K. O Osinowo had told the court that the defendants have been in jail for an offence they did not commit. He said one of them got shot when they were in a meeting. Osinowo told the court that the PDP Chairman in Lagos State, Mr. Moshood Salvador, who was also accused of the same offence after being incarcerated in prison custody by a Yaba Magistrate’s Court, was on Tuesday released by a vacation judge, Justice Obafemi Adamson, following the legal advice from the office of the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP). The defendants alongside the PDP Chairman in Lagos State, Mr. Moshood Salvador, and Victoria Falowo, Mukaila Odukoya, Oropo Isaac, Mohammed Babangida and Ugochukwu Nwoke, were accused of the murder, of the party’s local government Chairman in Apapa Local Government Area of the state, Adeniyi Aborishade. A Yaba Magistrate Court, Lagos had earlier ordered the remand of the suspects after they were arraigned by the police over conspiracy and unlawful killing. The Chief Magistrate, Mr. Oyetade Komolafe, however, issued a remand order and thereafter adjourned the matter till August 27, 2018 for Department of Public Prosecution advice.
