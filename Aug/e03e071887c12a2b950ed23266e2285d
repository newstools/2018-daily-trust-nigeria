Emmerson Mnangagwa has taken the oath as Zimbabwe’s president, after winning last month’s bitterly contested election that marked the country’s first vote since Robert Mugabe was removed from power. The Constitutional Court confirmed Mnangagwa’s election victory in a ruling released on Friday, dismissing a challenge by the man he defeated in the July 30 ballot, opposition leader Nelson Chamisa. Thousands of people, some from outside the capital, and foreign leaders gathered on Sunday at Harare’s national stadium for the swearing-in of Mnangagwa, who just secured the 50 percent of votes needed to avoid a runoff against Chamisa. Mnangagwa pledged to “protect and promote the rights of Zimbabweans” in his oath. The election was touted as a crucial step towards shedding the pariah reputation Zimbabwe gained under Mnangagwa’s predecessor Robert Mugabe, and securing international donor funding to revive a crippled economy.
