Senate President Bukola Saraki and his deputy, Ike Ekweremadu, have alleged that the federal government is planning to implicate and indict them along with some of their colleagues in the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) over the recent invasion of the National Assembly by the Department of State Services (DSS). The two senate presiding officers said they got information that the government was planning to use the preliminary report submitted by Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ibrahim Idris to link them to the invasion. In a statement by their spokesmen, Yusuph Olaniyonu and Uche Anichukwu, the two presiding officers said after receiving the interim report, the price resolved to constitute a closet panel. They alleged that the mandate of the closet panel to review the report and submit a final recommendation was to turn facts on the head and blame the invasion on them to present them as having worked in tandem with the sacked Director General of the DSS Lawal Daura. “We have been reliably informed that instead of the Presidency to set up a public inquiry or judicial commission to probe last Tuesday’s invasion of the National Assembly as being demanded by the general public, they have commenced a process of manipulation and fabrication. “The Presidency has set up a closet panel, which would work to a predetermined conclusion in which they will now claim that the Senate President and the Deputy Senate President worked in collusion with ex-DG of DSS, LawalDaura to stage the invasion. “Their plot only failed because the media, particularly social media, Nigerians and international community responded very swiftly as some legislators who came into the complex were refused entry by gun-wielding, hooded security operatives. “Now, they want to turn the facts on its head and blame us for their botched plot against democracy. This is their new tactic and plot as we approach the  period of the 2019 polls,” the statement said.
