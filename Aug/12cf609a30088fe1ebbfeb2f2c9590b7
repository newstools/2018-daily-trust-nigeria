A pro-democracy group, Movement for Democratic Goals (MDG) said it will mobilize its members to resist any plan by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) or any other person or group planning to impeach Senate President Bukola Saraki. A statement by the National Coordinator of the group, Aliyu Abdulkareem, yesterday in Abuja, said, “We have been reliably informed by our sources in the APC that governors and senators on the platform of the party are holding several meetings to raise funds to begin several illegal processes that may force Senate President Bukola Saraki out of office by a group of minority senators. “We also have it on good note that the governors and senators are planning to meet this week to finalise plans and raise the said  funds as part of their individual commitment to the plans that would eventually lead to the impeachment of Saraki as Senate President.” The group said while it is part of democracy for a Senate President to be impeached, “We strongly condemn any illegal and unconstitutional attempt by the APC and its members to pooh-pooh the constitution in a desperate bid to impeach the Senate President by a minority vote.”
