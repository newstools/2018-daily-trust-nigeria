Alhaji Sani Bello travelled to Sokoto to advise his fellow Governor Aminu Tambuwal against his defection, a political associate and adviser on strategy to the Niger State governor, Chief Ray Murphy, has said. Murphy, who reacted yesterday to the social media reports suggesting that Governor Bello was one of the governors that would defect from the APC to the PDP, dismissed the insinuation as false. He said the governor and his people were happy with the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari. He quoted the governor as saying that those decamping were making a mistake because their destinations would not be better than APC. Murphy said: “As a member of the APC, the governor is satisfied and his people are satisfied and he is concerned with the progress of the APC in Niger State. “He has received cooperation from the people of Niger State, the party at the national level and from Mr. President and he has no reason whatsoever to leave the party. “He has a good relationship with the President as a governor, as he said those who are decamping are making a mistake. “He said nobody should link him with any thought of decamping, though those who are decamping are his associates as they are governors. “He even went to Sokoto to dissuade Tambuwal from decamping. But Tambuwal decamped for his personal reason, including his presidential ambition. That is his position,” Murphy said.
