A Nigerian journalist, Jones Abiri who has spent two years in Department of State Services (DSS), denied planning to bomb oil installations as claimed by the government.

Abiri, publisher of the Weekly Source, a newspaper based in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state, was arrested in 2016 for allegedly being the leader of the joint revolutionary council of the Joint Niger Delta Liberation Force, a separatist group.

The journalist was also accused of threatening to bomb oil installations.

While speaking with reporters after he was arraigned in court on Thursday, he also denied demanding money from oil companies.

“The alleged offence was that I sent a threat message to Nigerian Agip Oil Company and Shell, demanding the sum of N250 million from them… I don’t know of this,” the journalist said.
