The Kano State Government has spent the sum of N275 million on youths empowerment, the state Governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, has said.

Ganduje stated this in Kano on Saturday during the flag-off of its newly introduced cash transfer disbursement to 8, 800 youths at the Government House, Kano.

According to him, the gesture was to enable the beneficiaries to start their own businesses in order to become self-reliant.

“The programme is driven by the need to encourage our youths to be self-employed and to establish their own businesses.

“A total of 8, 800 youths drawn from across the 44 local governments of the state will benefit from the empowerment and each of them will receive N20,000.

“Another set of 6, 600 comprising women only will also benefit from the programme and each of them will get N15,000,” Ganduje said.
