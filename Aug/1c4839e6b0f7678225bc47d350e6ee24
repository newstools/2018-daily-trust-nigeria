Secretary of the Area Councils Service Secretariat of the FCT Administration, Adamu Abubakar Bappa, has said that the need to ascertain the staff strength of all area councils necessitated the planned biometric data capturing exercise. He said the exercise, to be carried out by all the six area councils, would enhance adequate planning which would usher in better days for all staff. Bappa, who spoke with journalists on Tuesday, said the administration was concerned about the wellbeing of residents, especially the staff, hence the need to have a system that could fast-track development in the territory. “The biometric data across the six area councils will make us know the actual staff strength in the councils, including the teachers. It is like a compendium of staff, so we expect bonafide staff not to panic,” he said. Bappa said the consultant, who would work with staff of the relevant agencies for the exercise, was given six weeks to conclude the job and submit the report of the study to the FCT Administration.
