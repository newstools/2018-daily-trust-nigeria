US Republican Senator John McCain will no longer be continuing treatment for his brain cancer, his family has announced. His family said he had “surpassed expectations for his survival” and made the choice to end his treatment. Mr McCain, 81, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain tumour last summer and had been undergoing treatment since July 2017. He left Washington in December, but has remained a vocal political figure. He has, at times, been a fierce critic of President Donald Trump. The six-term senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee was diagnosed after doctors discovered his tumour during surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last July. (BBC)
