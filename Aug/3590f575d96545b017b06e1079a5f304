An Ogba, Lagos, chief magistrate court yesterday ordered that a teenager, Habeeb Dosunmu, be remanded in prison for allegedly robbing a lady with a pair of scissors. The police alleged that Dosunmu attacked Rita Ikuni armed with the dangerous weapon along Mushin Road by Eleja bus stop, Itire, Lagos, and threatened to stab her. The prosecutor, Inspector Ekadu Edet, said though the incident took place at night, Ikuni was able to identify the accused as the person who attacked her. On Ritaâ€™s report of the attack at the Itire police division, policemen were able to trail the accused and arrest him. The prosecutor appealed to the court to entertain the matter as a case of armed robbery since Edet was, he alleged, armed with a dangerous weapon during the attack on his victim. The presiding magistrate, Mr K.O. Ogundare, ordered Dosunmu to be remanded in prison custody without an option of bail and directed the prosecutor to send the case file to the Department of Police Prosecution (DPP) for advice. The matter was adjourned till September 20, 2018.
