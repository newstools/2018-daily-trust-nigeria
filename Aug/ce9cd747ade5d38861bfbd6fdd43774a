The President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki has described the death of former Secretary General of the United Nations (UN), Koffi Annan, as the end of a golden era in global politics and international relations.

Saraki in a statement by his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Mr Yusuph Olaniyonu, described the late Annan as a quintessential African diplomat on the global plane and a citizen of the world.

He said the deceased deployed his vast capacities to tackle intractable global challenges ranging from hunger, conflict, epidemic and restoration of peace in war torn countries.

Saraki noted that many developing nations benefitted immensely from the humanitarian efforts of late Annan as he was able to raise the concerns and challenges confronting “forgotten peoples and nations in the Assembly of world powers.

“Africa has indeed lost one of her best. He shall be sorely missed.”

The president of the senate commiserated with the wife and children of the deceased, the Government and people of Ghana.
