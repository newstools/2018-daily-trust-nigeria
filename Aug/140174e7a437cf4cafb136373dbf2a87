Nigerian contingents attending this year’s Hajj have prayed for a peaceful and successful general elections scheduled for next year at Arafat, Saudi Arabia. The special prayer session was organized by the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) and attended by many Nigerians that performed Hajj this year. Over 55,000 Nigerians are among the two million Muslim faithful that converged on the Plains of Arafat to perform the major ritual of Hajj. The prayer session was led by various Muslim clerics drawn from the six geopolitical zones of the country, and conducted in Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, English, Arabic, Ijaw, Fulfulde, among other languages. The clerics prayed for the peaceful conduct of the next year’s general elections as well as divine succor for the resolution of the myriad challenges of insurgency, herders-farmers clashes, kidnappings for ransom, robust economic growth, among others. In his opening remarks, NAHCON chairman Abdullahi Mukhtar Muhammed said this year’s prayer session was expedient because the country is facing an election year. The NAHCON chief said the pilgrims should also take advantage of the special day to pray for the continued wellbeing of the country. He said pilgrims should also pray for the country’s leadership especially President Muhammadu Buhari to enable him continue to steer the nation well. In his brief remarks, the Nigerian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Justice Muhammad Dodo said this year’s Arafat is the last one before elections billed for 2019. “By the time the next Arafat day holds, elections would have been held in our dear country, may I therefore, call on you all to pray for the successful conduct of the elections,” the ambassador said.
