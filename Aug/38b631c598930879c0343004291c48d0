Over 5,000 internally displaced persons in Zurmi Local Government Area of Zamfara State returned to their communities, the outgoing force commander, Operation Saharan Daji, Major-General Mohammed Mohammed, has said. Speaking yesterday during the handing over of  the Force command to Major-General Stevenson Olabanji, he said the command was making efforts to stabilise communities in Shinkafi. “We are gradually stabilizing Zamfara state, our standing troops are functional and bandits are fleeing our operations even though we are aware of this and we have blocked the possible escape routes ranging from Bena in the neighbouring Kebbi state and Kontagora in Niger state,” he said. He said Operations Saharan Daji had been formalized into one operation by the Defence Headquarters with a mandate to end armed banditry, kidnapping, and cattle rustling. In his address, Olabanji pledged to sustain the collaboration between the army and other security agencies.
