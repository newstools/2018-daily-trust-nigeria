Suspected gunmen shot dead a man and abducted two others at Sheda in Kwali Area Council. A resident said the deceased, Mr. Nandap Chackven was killed on Monday at about 11:40pm. The resident Joshua Musa said heavily armed people invaded the village and whisked away two residents. He said the deceased, a tenant to one of the kidnapped people, was shot after he attempted attacking the gunmen thinking they were hoodlums that usually terrorised the residents. “The man was shot on the chest and abdomen,” he said. Musa added that after killing Mr. Chackven, the gunmen went into the compound and abducted the landlord and one of his neighbours. Wife of one the kidnapped victims, Mrs. Felicia Yunusa, said about 16 gunmen entered their house after they broke the door with a log. “One of the gunmen used the butt of his gun to hit my husband’s elder sister and collected N60,000 from her after they had collected some money and three handsets, including that of my husband,” she said. Mrs. Yinusa said the gunmen escaped with her husband, Yunusa Yusuf, and one of his neighbours, Isah Ibrahim, into the bush. She said one of the gunmen had called on Tuesday demanding for N10m ransom. “Actually, they used my husband’s handset to call at about 7am on Tuesday and demanded for N10m ransom,” she said.
