Briefing journalists at the end of a closed door meeting yesterday, Chairman, National Assembly Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, Senator Suleiman Nazif(APC, Bauchi) confirmed that INEC has submitted a new budget reflecting the sum of N143 billion as originally requested by President Muhammadu Buhari. Nazif said a sub-committee has been established to look into the details of the new budget submitted by INEC. The sub-committee is expected to complete its assignment today. “INEC has submitted a new budget that reflects the position of the National Assembly Joint Committee and we have set up a sub-committee to complete the assignment tomorrow,” Nazif told journalists. Also speaking with journalists, Senator Aliyu Sabi (APC, Niger) assured that the committee is determined to urgently complete work on the election budget. He said part of the reason for setting up the sub-committee was to speed up the legislative processes for the election budget.
