Non-stop rainfall wreaks havoc in Kaduna  From Christiana T. Alabi, Kaduna  Non-stop rain that fell for hours in Kaduna on Thursday wreaked havoc as many parts of the state was flooded with water.  The rain which started falling Thursday at about 1pm continued into the night.  The heavy flow of water submerged some houses, pulled down many fences and houses in different areas. The roads, gutters and drainages were also flooded.  As at evening when workers closed from work, the rain was still falling heavily as a result of which many commuters were stranded.  Our reporter observed that the Kaduna river has already overflown its banks at different locations.  The Kaduna State Environmental Protection Authority (KEPA) had earlier notified communities along River Kaduna to maintain vigilance as rainstorms are highly probable.  The State Emergency Management Agency had also warned people residing close to water ways and river banks to vacate such areas for fear of flood.  The Nigerian Meteorological Services (NIMET) had predicted that Kaduna State may experience flood this year, which led the state government in collaboration with Zoom Lion Global Alliance, a waste management company to embark on emergency evacuation of refuse from areas prone to flood.
