Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has challenged his predecessor, Senator Rabi'u Musa Kwankwaso, to launch his presidential campaign for the 2019 general elections in Kano. Speaking at the second phase of empowerment of 6,600 women yesterday, Ganduje said the people of Kano would never welcome Kwankwaso. "The people of Kano have every right to reject him. In fact, we have already rejected him. We never considered him as potential presidential candidate. We shall continue to maintain our position about him. We know nobody but President Buhari. "Kwankwaso is aware that the people of Kano will use democratic way to show him an exit from political participation,” the governor said Ganduje recalled that when some of the popular markets in Kano experienced fire disasters, Kwankwaso did not come to the state to sympathise with the victims not to talk of donating to them. He said those who care about Kano had made their contributions to the victims. He said Kano is solely for Buhari and not any other presidential candidate, noting that, "We are waiting for Kwankwaso to come to Kano and launch his campaign. We will use all democratically accepted ways and say ‘No’ to him."
