The FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has warned board members of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) against deviating from the cityâ€™s master plan. Bello, who was speaking while declaring open a retreat for members of the 7th FCDA board in Abuja, urged them to always insist on the implementation of the Abuja master plan in order to avoid congestion being experienced in Lagos which, he said, was already rearing its head in the territory. The minister, who was represented by the FCT Permanent Secretary, Christian Ohaa, also urged the board members to ensure they bring their wealth of experience to bear on their assignments. He said that way, they would bequeath to future generations a reputable federal city. He therefore charged the 10 board members to chart a way forward through brainstorming session at board meetings, saying the retreat could not have come at a more auspicious time than now that the administration is being repositioned to deliver on its mandates.
