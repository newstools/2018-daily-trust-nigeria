The Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA) has said it will continue to fix failed portions on the Abuja-Keffi road until the Federal Ministry of Works carries out the planned holistic expansion of the dual carriageway. The agency commenced intensive rehabilitation works on the Abuja-Keffi dual carriageway at the weekend. The road has, in recent weeks, witnessed traffic gridlock in areas where the road has failed forcing motorists to slow down. The areas currently being repaired include that between the popular Sharp Corner at Mararaba to Chris Park junction; the building materials area down to the military checking point and other critical areas of the road. The FERMA team, led by the Federal Road Maintenance Engineer in charge of the FCT, Engr. Ambrose Omame, who worked throughout the night over the weekend, said work done included the desilting of drainages and waste evacuation. On his part, the Nyanya Unit Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission, Mr Arinze Agu, who also joined the FERMA team with his men to ensure free traffic flow at night, urged motorists not to drive on the road shoulders and desist from overloading their vehicles.
