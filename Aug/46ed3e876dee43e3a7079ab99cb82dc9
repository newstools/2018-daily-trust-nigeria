This rising attack and detention of journalists in Nigeria signals a disturbing and gory descent back into the abyss of Decree 4, an anti-graft advocacy group said on Wednesday.

This was disclosed in a statement by Akin Fadeyi, executive director of Akin Fadeyi Foundation (AFF), conveners of the inter-sectoral campaign against corruption in Nigeria – Corruption not in my country.

“It is a sad irony indeed, that the same General Buhari, a beneficiary of freedom of expression under democracy through which he became a civilian President has returned to running a repressive government through a security apparatus that is becoming increasingly rascally,” the statement said.

The anti-graft said “the detention of Mr. Samuel Ogundipe now is regrettable, reckless, unlawful and makes a huge mockery of a government that has just announced a planned policy reform of the same Police institution. 

“It is equally laughable that a supposed law enforcement institution which is expected to be informed and versed in the doctrinal tenets of the media profession regarding confidentiality is demanding and pressurizing Samuel Ogundipe, a reporter to divulge the source of information over a story published by the newspaper, and several newspapers on a correspondence between the Inspector General of Police and the Vice President. 

“We expected the police to know better, pick a learning from Samuel's bold exposure and therefore, fine-tune its internal processes for better outputs in subsequent outings.”

The statement said this bare-fang attack on Premium Times is a clear demonstration of ignorance of every letter in the Nigerian Freedom of Information Act signed into Law on May 28, 2011.
