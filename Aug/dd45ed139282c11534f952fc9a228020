The Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo (III), has called on ethnic chiefs in the chiefdom to ensure peace in their domains. Nizazo, who spoke at the coronation of some ethnic chiefs at his palace on Saturday, said the traditional heads should ensure cooperation of all residents in managing crisis. He noted that the ethnic chiefs must know how to maintain the long-existing practice of crisis management especially between farmers and herdsmen to ensure peace and progress of the chiefdom. “We want to ensure that all ethnic groups are duly represented in the area council to have their full support and cooperation in crisis management,” he said. The traditional ruler also said Abuja is a melting point for all ethnic groups in the country, adding that all hands must be on deck for success in running the affairs of communities. Four sons of Kwali chiefdom, Ibrahim Tera (Galadima of Kwali); Jiya Nizazo (Sarkin Yama of Kwali), Mohammed Kura (Majidadin of Kwali); and three other persons from Yoruba, Jukun and Fulani ethnic groups were turbaned by the traditional head.
