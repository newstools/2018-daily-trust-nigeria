Islamic scholars from northern region on Sunday met in Kaduna to look at activities of the Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky-led Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), popularly called 'Shi'ites', saying IMN remains a security threat to the country. The scholars stated this at the book presentation on the "Fallacy of Shi'ites beliefs," authored by fiery professor, Prof. Umar Labdo of the Maitama Sule University (formerly Northwest University), Kano and organised by the Mahdi Foundation and the International Institute of Islamic Research and Development. They equally condemned what they described as "excesses" of the IMN in the north and alleged that the sect had manipulated the Holy Quran to suit themselves. Secrerary-General, Jama'atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Dr. Khalid Aliyu Abubakar, said the only way to check the excesses of the Shi'ites is through the acquisition of knowledge in order to dislodge them. "We have come to the end of this important presentation.  If there is knowledge, we can change the excesses of the Shi'ites," Khalid said. The book reviewer from the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Prof.  Salisu Shehu Abubakar, expressed grave concern that the Shi'ites had manipulated the Quran to suit themselves. He called on Muslims not to allow Shi'ite members occupy any position of authority in the land. "We have heard that they have directed their members to collect their Permanent Voter Cards. We must all ensure that all Muslims collect their own (PVC) too," he said. On his part, the Emir of Hadejia, Adamu Abubakar Maje, who was represented by Galadima Hadejia, Alhaji Usman Abdullaziz, said the emirate council would support any move to curtail IMN’s extremism. Reacting to the claims by the scholars, spokesperson of the IMN, Ibrahim Musa said any gang-up by any group against them would fail. He added, "This gathering is also an attempt to justify the Zaria massacre of December 2015 and the subsequent victimisation of IMN members, which in reality is unjustifiable."
