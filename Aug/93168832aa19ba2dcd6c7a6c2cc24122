A former military governor of Kaduna State, retired Col. Abubakar Umar, has alleged that the former Director General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Lawal Daura, was running a parallel government before his recent sack. In a statement, Umar, who commended the government for sacking the former DSS boss, said:  “In the last three years, Lawal Daura had marched from one audacious act of impunity to another, had rudely defied the president, had routinely ignored court orders and seemed all but successful in carving out for himself a government within a government in Nigeria.” He said given all the distress created by the actions of Daura and those caused through his refusal to act, the decision to sack him did not come a moment too soon, and in the interest of Nigeria’s democracy and in order to guard against unexpected threats and conspiracies, the action taken by the acting president must not stop halfway but the government should seek to discover the motives as well as the explanation for some of those actions. The former governor said questions that should be asked should include: where, and in what condition the assets handed over to Lawal Daura by Ita Ekpenyong are, the reasons Daura deployed DSS operatives and prevented EFCC personnel from searching the residences of Ekpenyong and former D-G, NIA, Mr. Oke and the explanation for the raid on the farm belonging to Ibrahim Magu, which raid led to loss of life. He said similar punishment should be meted to  other persons involved in the invasion of the National Assembly.
