For revealing the HIV status of a female worker to her employer, a middle-aged man, Casmir Obi, will remain in prison custody till he perfects the conditions of the bail an Igbosere chief magistrate court granted him at the weekend. Two women, Margaret Monday and Stella Clement, have been listed as Obiâ€™s accomplices. The three accused persons were sued on Friday for allegedly exposing the health status of a patient. The patient (names withheld) had reported the matter at the Area A Command, Victoria Island, after she discovered that she was sacked from her job because the accused persons had allegedly revealed her health status to her employer. The prosecutor, Mr Reuben Solomon, told the court that the news of the HIV status began to spread like wildfire after the accused persons made the case known to the public. Solomon said his client, a worker in a restaurant at the Bar Beach police station, had consulted Obi, whom she knew as a doctor, for treatment.
