The Electoral Act amendment bill passed by the National Assembly on July 24 and transmitted to President Muhammadu Buhari on August 3 is still awaiting the Presidentâ€™s assent, a presidential aide has said. Ita Enang, who is the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly matters (Senate), said in Abuja yesterday that media reports that the President rejected the bill were not true. Enang said the President declined assent to a bill transmitted to him on June 27, noting that the one the lawmakers passed hours before they proceeded on their annual recess was still with the President.
