Governor Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo of Gombe State yesterday declared his ambition to contest the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential ticket in 2019. Dankwambo made the declaration in Gombe, during a meeting with delegates and executives of the party from the North-east region. He said he decided to vie for the PDP ticket after numerous calls and wide consultations with stakeholders from the zone. “There have been calls on me from across the country to contest the presidency in 2019; however I feel it is pertinent to seek the consent of delegates from my zone before I throw my hat into the contest. “Therefore, after much consultation with various stakeholders, I was asked to show interest and counting on your support I have accepted to contest for the office of the president under the PDP in 2019. A date for a formal declaration would be announced after the on-going consultation is concluded,” he said. The governor added that the North-east zone has been consulting and lobbying other geo-political zones to allow the region to produce the next flag bearer of the PDP. He maintained that the country needs an honest, young and energetic leader that would provide a purposeful leadership, defeat Boko Haram, revive the economy and take out hunger from the country. He said: “We should go for an honest leader that would not lie to us that he would finish the Boko Haram in three months. What we need is a president that would provide us with a template that can show to us that he can finish the Boko Haram in good time. “The country needs a leader who knows the economy because people are hungry, therefore we need a president that has a plan to improve the economy”.
