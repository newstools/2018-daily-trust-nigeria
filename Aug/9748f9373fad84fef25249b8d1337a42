A customary court at Mapo, Ibadan, on Friday dissolved the eight-year-old marriage between Kazeem Olaniyi and Alimat, his wife. Alimat, in her petition, described Olaniyi as “irresponsible”, alleging his attitude once forced her to leave Ibadan for Lagos to ensure she provides for her children. She alleged that her husband had three children from another woman but hid that fact from her. She said Olaniyi was giving only N200 daily as feeding allowance for their two children and never cared to pay house rent and the children’s school fees. It was her elder sister and mother, she told the court, who paid for the house rent when the landlord issued them a quit notice. But Olaniyi maintained he was a responsible man who cared so much about the well-being of his family. He said his wife gave birth to her first child at one of the best hospitals in Ibadan, owned by one of his friends. He said his wife was “a troublesome woman” who never listened to him and refused to change. The president of the court, Mr Suleiman Apampa, dissolved the marriage and granted the custody of the two children to the plaintiff. He ordered Olaniyi to be paying N6,000 monthly as their feeding allowance through the court and urged him to be responsible for their school fees, health and well-being.
