The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) on Friday evening concluded the airlift of intending pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the 2018 hajj exercise. 

The pilgrims, including those of private tour operators and NAHCON officials, were airlifted at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja. 

Speaking with newsmen, the commissioner of operations, Abdullahi Modibbo, said state pilgrims welfare boards registered about 40,000 people, while close to 19,000 registered through private tour operators. 

Modibbo, however, said the late conclusion of the airlift was due to late registration by intending pilgrims, stressing that NAHCON had been making efforts to ensure timely airlift. 

"Pilgrims did not turn out for registration in good time. If they had turned out in good time, everything would have been done much earlier than now", he said. 

Meanwhile, the return flight to Nigeria is expected to commence August 27, 2018, Modibbo added.
