A 34-year-old armed robber, Abiodun Oluwa, has been arrested hiding in the ceiling of his house when police came calling. A locally made pistol with one cartridge was allegedly recovered from him.

The police also swooped on Toheeb Ogunjimi, Matthew Olumosu, Qudus Akala and Akintoya Faruq at Olayinka/Cele, Itire, and allegedly recovered one black toy gun, one Itel phone, three Nokia phones, one Tecno phone, one Alcatel phone, one Sony phone, one locally made double-barrelled pistol and one live cartridge from them.
