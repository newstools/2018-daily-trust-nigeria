The crisis rocking the Benue State House of Assembly continued in a Makurdi High Court on Wednesday as the matter has been adjourned to August 24 for hearing. Daily Trust reports that two factions of the lawmakers are laying claims to the leadership of the House. But, an interim orders issued by the Presiding Judge, Justice Theresa Igoche, restraining the factional leaders subsist with one group ordered not to parade themselves as principal officers of the House and the other directed not to reconvene at the assembly complex. The impeached, Terkimbi Ikyange is insisting that he remains the substantive Speaker while the newly elected Speaker, Titus Uba is also claiming right of office after his 22 members faction met without the embattled Ikyange convening the House while on recess. Ikyange is represented in court by Mamman Mike Osuman and other lawyers while Governor Samuel Ortom, Uba and 23 others are represented by Sebastian Hon (SAN) with Edward Ashiekaa (SAN) as well as other lawyers. While both the embattled Ikyange and Uba severally secured court orders restraining each other from conducting business of the House, the governor, Uba and 23 others are also applying for an interim injunction restraining the Chief Judge of the State from receiving process and constituting any panel for the impeachment move against the Governor. Our correspondent reports that at the resumed trial yesterday,  the matter could not continue for the dual reasons of problem of service and time requirement for response to court process. Hon posited that he was not ready to continue with the business of the day on account of service while Osuman argued that the Motion on Notice brought by Ortom, Uba and 22 others was not ripe for hearing. Justice Igoche after listening to both counsels however adjourned the matter to August, 24.
