Russia condemned new US sanctions as “draconian” on Thursday after news of the measures sent the rouble tumbling to two-year lows and sparked a wider asset sell-off. The US State Department said on Wednesday it would impose new sanctions by the end of August after determining that Moscow used a nerve agent against a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain. It was an allegation Russia has repeatedly denied. Moscow has long cast the accusations as a Western plot to damage its reputation and provide a convenient pretext for more sanctions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking to reporters on a conference call, said the US move was “absolutely unfriendly”. “Making a linking to these events is for us unacceptable and such restrictions like those passed by the American side earlier ... are absolutely illegal and do not correspond to international law,” said Peskov.
