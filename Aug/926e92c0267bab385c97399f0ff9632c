An eight-year-old girl named Khadijat has been battered by her aunt who brought her to Kaduna from Kogi state. It was gathered that her aunt, Mrs Peace Afolabi who resides at Kakau in Chikun Local Government area of Kaduna state inflicted injuries on her body with razor blade while her husband also burnt the little girl’s buttocks with fire last Tuesday. Residents in the neighbourhood said Mrs. Afolabi claimed that the little girl stole her N20 and that she sold goods worth N300 in her shop to a customer on credit. Daily Trust further gathered that the little girl had been facing one form of torture and child labour before she was eventually battered by the couple. Mrs Afolabi is said to be a twin sister to Khadijat’s father and that she brought the girl from Kogi to stay with her in Kaduna. When contacted, the state Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Hajiya Hafsat Baba, said the girl has been rescued and taken to the hospital while the culprit has been handed over to police for further interrogation. She however warned parents and guardians to desist from abusing children, saying anyone found wanting will be punished under the child protection law of the state.
