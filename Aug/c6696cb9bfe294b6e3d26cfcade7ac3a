The Yobe State committee on environmental sanitation has warned residents of the state against indiscriminate dumping of refuse on water ways. The state Deputy Governor, Engr Abubakar Ali, who is also the chairman of the committee, gave the warning at the inauguration of sub-committee to investigate the remote cause of the flood that destroyed hundreds of houses in Damaturu, the state capital. The deputy governor said government had spent huge amount of money on drainage constructions to prevent flood but, the unsavoury practice of indiscriminate dumping of refuse had rendered many families homeless. He said the state government would act swiftly on the report submitted by the sub-committee, while emphasize the administration’s commitment on zero tolerance to violation of environmental laws in any part of the state. The General Manager, Yobe State Environmental Sanitation Agency, Alhaji Idi Wadina, also regretted that the effort of his agency to maintain clean, hygienic and flood free environment was being sabotaged by ‘unscrupulous’ people on daily basis. “We never failed in our responsibility to routinely evacuate drainages, waste disposal, and removal of sand heaps that blocked main roads across the state. “To our dismay, the same people that dumped refuse into their drains are waiting for us to evacuate it at their door steps. They don’t care about their health condition or even blame government at the time of flood or disease outbreak”, he said. He advised those who built on water ways to immediately vacate as the agency would not spare anyone caught violating the state law.
