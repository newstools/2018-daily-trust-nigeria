The Senator representing the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in the National Assembly, Philip Tanimu Aduda, has said he has not defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Aduda, while addressing journalists, yesterday, urged his supporters to disregard the rumour on his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). “I want to make it clear that I did not defect from PDP to APC as being reported by some media outlets and on social media. I remain in PDP and I will have nothing to with APC,” he said. Aduda, who spoke through his special adviser on political matters, Abdulrahman Mohammed Takushara, said he had been a member of the PDP since 2003 and saw no reason why he should abandon the party that brought to him to the National Assembly. Aduda also condemned the siege on the National Assembly by men of the DSS in the attempt to debar the lawmakers from their constitutional responsibilities. “I condemn in its entirety the illegal, discriminatory, and nefarious occupation by the DSS of the National Assembly complex,” he said.
