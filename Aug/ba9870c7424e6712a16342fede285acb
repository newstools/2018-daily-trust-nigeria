At least 10 persons died Saturday in a twin suicide bomb attack in a crowded place at Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State. Residents told Daily Trust that two women detonated explosive devices at the entrance of the town from the direction of Gwoza. A resident, Aura Garga, said the bombers struck around 12 pm on Saturday, killing themselves and ten others. He said many people who sustained various degrees of injuries were evacuated for medical attention. Military authorities at the 28 Task Force Battalion in Mubi could not be reached for comment. Madagali, located more than 250 kilometers from Yola, had suffered frequent attacks since its liberation from Boko Haram in 2015.
