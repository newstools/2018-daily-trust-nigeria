Ondo State governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu SAN, has declared Thursday (August 30, 2018) as work-free day in Ondo state. According to the state commissioner for Information, Mr. Yemi Olowolabi, this followed a resolution of the State Executive Council which stated that a work-free day be observed in the state to allow public servants participate in the continous voters registration exercise which closes on Friday, August 31, 2018. The governor urged the people of the state to take full advantage of the holiday to register and obtain their permanent voters cards (PVC). He said if they register, they will be able to cast their votes in the forthcoming general election in Nigeria. “Workers in state are expected back at work on Friday, August 31, 2018,” the commissioner said.
