One of the victims, who was brought back to Nigeria recounted her ordeal in Saudi Arabia. The victim, whose face was veiled while speaking, said her Dubai-based friend introduced her to an agent in Nigeria who facilitated her trip to the Kingdom. She said, “I was taken for medical in Dr Wada’s Hospital. She promised that I would go to Saudi Arabia as a sales girl and that I would be earning Saudi money that is equivalent to N150,000. “Everything was processed through an agent and when we got there, it was a different thing entirely. “When I got there, I was taken to a particular home, my passport was taken from me. When I see the condition, I told her that I could not cope and she said that I would pay N1.7 million before I could be released and if I could not pay I would have to work for two years. “So I contacted a journalist friend who contacted NAPTIP and the agency contacted the embassy through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That’s how I was brought back. “It is not easy for all the girls in Saudi Arabia. I almost committed suicide.” She, therefore, called on the federal government to come the aid of other girls who are trapped in the kingdom. “Nigeria girls are passing through hell in Saudi Arabia. There may not be work in Nigeria but it is better to stay back. “I went through physical torture because my boss and her children would beat me when I said that I wanted to go back to Nigeria,” she added.
