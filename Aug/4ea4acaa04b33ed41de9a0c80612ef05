House of Representatives lawmakers under the aegis of Parliamentary Democrats Group (PDG) on Sunday accused Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, of sponsoring some APC senators to cause chaos and instability in the National Assembly. Briefing journalists in Abuja, PDG spokesman, Timothy Golu (PDP, Plateau), alleged that "these APC senators who were offered huge sums of money by Osinbajo and Oshiomhole, have resolved to clamp down on the lawmakers that recently defected from the APC to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)." Golu added, "We hereby advise the Vice President not to allow himself to be used to desecrate the institution of the National Assembly or to perpetuate any illegality under his watch as the Acting President." The lawmakers said they were dismayed that Osinbajo and Oshiomhole could dole out such huge sums of money from government coffers to sway senators and members of the House of Representatives against the the leadership of the two chambers. The group expressed concern that the attempt by the APC-led government to muzzle the opposition portends grave danger for Nigeria's democracy, warning that PDG was poised to resist all such "extreme plot by desperate politicians." It also called on Nigerians to uphold the integrity, sanctity and independence of the National Assembly to ensure that all members freely associate with political parties that will enable them deliver the dividends of democracy to their constituents.
