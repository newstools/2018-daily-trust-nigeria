At least 24 people have been killed in a bus accident east of the Ecuadorean capital, Quito. The bus collided with an SUV carrying five people, three of whom died. Most of the 38 people listed on the bus’s passenger list are Colombians and Venezuelans, officials said. The accident comes just two days after 12 fans of Barcelona SC football club were killed when the bus they were travelling in overturned on their way back from an away game. Tuesday’s accident happened between the towns of Pifo and Papallacta on a bend called locally “devil’s curve” at just before 03:00 local time (08:00 GMT). Firefighters said the bus belonged to the Colombian company Cotrans and had originated in the Colombian city of Neiva. Its Colombian driver is reportedly among those killed. Ecuadorean officials have contacted the relevant embassies for help identifying the dead.
