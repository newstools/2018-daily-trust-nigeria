Australia’s Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has announced her resignation from the cabinet. Her move came as new Prime Minister Scott Morrison named his cabinet after winning a bruising leadership contest on Friday. Ms Bishop said she had not yet decided whether to stand at the next general election, due in 2019. She had sought the prime minister’s job after Malcolm Turnbull stood aside, but was eliminated in the first round.
