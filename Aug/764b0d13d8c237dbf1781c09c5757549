Four men are being held at the Lagos Police Command Headquarters for allegedly diverting goods worth N10 million. The four suspects were said to have diverted a 1 by 20 feet container which was seized by operatives of the Nigeria Customs Service. In their confessional statement, the suspects - Ganiyu Yusuf, 62, Femi Adewara, 51, Ibrahim Suleimon, 30s, and Akeem Abdullahi, 48 - said, contrary to what the police alleged, they actually bought the goods from a licensed Customs auctioneers in Apapa. Ganiyu Yusuf said they paid N4.5 million before the container was released to them three weeks ago. He said they had gone to the Port to see the consignments which include 406 cartons of floor tiles; six iron doors, three packs of wooden frame; and 29 wood PVC. “We were in our business place at Sango Ota area of Ogun State when the police came to arrest us. Before we were brought to Lagos, we were told that we should be ready to lead them to those who sold the goods to us. I know that we bought the goods at a very cheap rate, but those who put us in this mess should not be allowed to go free,” he added. Lagos State Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal, who confirmed the arrest, adding that the stealing was done with the aid of forged documents which enabled them to move the container out of the port. “Suspects will be charged to court as soon as investigation into the case is over” he added.
