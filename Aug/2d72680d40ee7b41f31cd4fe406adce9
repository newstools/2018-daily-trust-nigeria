At least 15 people have died in a bomb and gun attack in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, an official says. Gunmen stormed a government building after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate. Afghan security forces had ended the assault and killed two of the gunmen but much of the building was destroyed, a government spokesman said. No militant group has yet said it is behind the attack, although the Taliban issued a statement denying involvement. Jalalabad and its surrounding area, which is near the border with Pakistan, has borne the brunt of IS attacks.
