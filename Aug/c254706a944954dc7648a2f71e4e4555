Iran’s parliament has voted to remove the economy minister from office as the country battles an economic crisis. Masoud Karbasian was targeted by a no-confidence vote over problems in the banking system, tax regulation and his failure to fix the economy. The move comes three weeks after Labour Minister Ali Rabiei was ousted in a similar process. President Hassan Rouhani’s government has struggled to control rising prices and the falling value of the currency. The re-imposition of sanctions by the US after its withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal has exacerbated the crisis. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused the US of launching a “psychological war against Iran and its business partners”, Tasnim news agency reported. Mr Karbasian lost the vote of confidence by 137 votes to 121 with two abstentions. The result was broadcast live on state radio.
