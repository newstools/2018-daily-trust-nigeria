The Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahaman Ajiya, has been awarded the Best Local Government Chairman in Nigeria and also the Best Chairman in North Central Nigeria at the Nigerian Local Government Development Award Night organised by Segnip Promotion Limited. The Managing Director of Segnip Promotion Limited, Mr. Kayode Adebayo, said the award was based on merit, adding that the committee went round the 774 local governments in Nigeria to physically assess projects carried out by the chairmen. “At the end of that tour of the 774 local governments in Nigeria, Abaji Area Council happened to be the best as we were able to see some viable projects,” he said. In his response, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya said the journey was tough during his first year in office. He said things later improved as God continued to give him the support of the electorate. “I see this award as a challenge to do more, it has opened my eyes to the fact that the world is watching. I assure the good people of Abaji to expect nothing less,” he said. The ceremony was held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, on Thursday.
