Malaysia’s civil aviation chief has quit after a report into the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 found failures by air traffic control. Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said the official report, released on Monday, highlighted lapses by controllers in relation to emergency procedures. The passenger jet had been missing, the report said, for about 20 minutes before authorities sent an alert. The aircraft mysteriously disappeared in 2014 with 239 people on board. An official search ended in May, although Malaysia’s new government has said it might resume the search if more credible evidence emerges. Responding to the report’s findings on Tuesday, Mr Rahman said in a statement that it was “with regret and after much thought and contemplation” that he was resigning as chairman of the civil aviation authority of Malaysia.
