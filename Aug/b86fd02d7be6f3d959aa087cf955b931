Traditional rulers in Ekiti State have pleaded with the state government to beef up security in their various palaces. Their call followed the gruesome murder of their colleague, the traditional ruler of Odo Oro Ekiti in Ikole Local Government Area of the state. Oba Gbadebo Ogunsakin was killed last Monday. The monarchs, mostly made up of Third Class and others with lesser grades, under the aegies of “Majority Obas of Ekiti”, made the appeal when they visited the town which has been in mourning since the incident took place. Led by the Olowa of Odo Owa Ekiti, Oba Ayomide Oyedeji, they described the incident as shocking, unfortunate and worrisome. According to them, the perpetrator of the crime may not have been successful if the palace had been fortified by armed security men, complementing local guards. Though they acknowledged that government had always given attention to their welfare, they said beefing up security in the palaces would be an added advantage. The traditional rulers also urged residents of the various communities to be security conscious and proactive by not leaving the job of watching over the palaces to security officials alone. The community was thrown into mourning last Monday when a 40-year old suspect from a royal background,  Omoniyi Ademola, who was initially said to be mental unstable, entered the palace unchallenged and stabbed the traditional ruler to death. The state police command has since arrested and paraded the suspect, who the police allege also owned-up to the crime. Speaking to journalists during an interview on Friday at the police headquarters, he said he defended himself when the deceased attacked him, saying he did not know that the Oba would die. At the time of filing this report, commercial activities were yet to return to the town as markets remain shut in honour of the late Oba. The late monarch ascended the throne in 1986.
