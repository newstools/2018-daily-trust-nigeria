The Cooperative Society of the Nigerian Union of Teachers in the Federal Capital Territory (NUT-FCT) has said it has empowered over 7,000 teachers in the territory. The cooperative society said the teachers were empowered by easy accessibility to credit facilities which, it noted, had strengthened and emboldened them to face the future without fear. The NUT-FCT made this known during a press conference ahead of its Annual General Meeting (AGM) yesterday. The chairman, publicity committee of the AGM, Comrade Muhammad A. Muhammad, said aside the credit facility, the cooperative had also been paying dividends to its members. “The NUT FCT Cooperative has over 7000 subscribers with access to loan and determined savings. The teachers have not only been empowered but also strengthened and emboldened to face the future without fear,” he said. He said NUT was established in 1931 to protect the rights and privileges of teachers. “The NUT-FCT wing has held to this dream of our visionary leaders. “Eight years ago the NUT-FCT took this vision further by establishing a cooperative society - in 2011,” he said adding that AGM will take place on August 11, 2018 at Government Senior Secondary School, Gwagwalada.
