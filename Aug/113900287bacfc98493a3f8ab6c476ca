The Nigerian Customs Service, Area 11 Onne, Rivers State,  has intercepted another set of military wears in the state. Displaying the wears to journalists yesterday, the Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs in charge of Zone C, Sanusi Umar, listed them as 620 sets of complete military camouflage uniforms and caps, 10,100 pieces of inner military T-shirts and 512 pairs of military jungles boots. He said they were loaded in a 40-footer container with registration number, MRKU 4909151. He recalled that the command had last month intercepted a-40 footer container loaded with 4,400 military wears. He said: “We are here to brief you on an ongoing investigation on container MRSU 3040298 containing military camouflage uniform and other military wears. You will recall that on 31st of July last month we briefed you on that container where we intercepted about 4,400 camouflage uniforms and shoes imported by a certain company.” He said the suspected importer of the wears, Ongwatabo Jerry, had been arrested and taken to Abuja for further investigation.
