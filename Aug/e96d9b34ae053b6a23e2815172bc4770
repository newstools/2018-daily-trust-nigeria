Principal Officers of the National Assembly could not hold a scheduled emergency meeting yesterday following the siege on the assembly complex by security operatives. Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yusuf Lasun (APC, Osun), who briefed journalists on why the planned meeting was called-off, blamed the Executive arm and security agencies for attempting to truncate the legislature. “We were informed yesterday by the Senate President through text messages that there will be meeting by 12:00 pm. But with the situation on ground, no meeting can hold. “People should realise that what defines democracy is the legislative arm of government. Today, that arm of government is being trampled upon; it is about to go into extinction,” Lasun said. The meeting of principal officers of both Senate and House of Representatives was earlier scheduled yesterday to discuss the proposed N242 billion budget for the 2019 general elections.
