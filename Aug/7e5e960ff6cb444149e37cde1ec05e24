 House of Representatives lawmakers under the aegis of Parliamentary Democrats Group (PDG) on Monday said despite appeal from the Presidency, the two chambers of the National Assembly would only reconvene if there are concrete assurances that no attempt would be made to impeach Senate President, Bukola Saraki or Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. The group, which stated this in Abuja via a press statement signed by its spokesman, Timothy Golu (PDP, Plateau), also said meetings are ongoing to consider the request from the Presidency, adding "there must be assurance that no illegality will be done against our leaders." Golu said the lawmakers are interested in peace, stability and the growth of democracy but are only worried by statements from anti-Saraki senators, such as Ali Ndume and Abdullahi Adamu, to the effect that the Senate President must resign or be removed. According to him, the leadership of the legislature can only be determined by the lawmakers themselves and not the executive or any political party. "The legislature is an independent arm of government and nobody can dictate for us. Our presiding officers are doing well and we have no cause to complain. We advice the Presidency and the ruling APC to allow us decide our fate," the statement noted.
