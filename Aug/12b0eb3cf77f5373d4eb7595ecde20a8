The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, cannot be arrested for alleged contempt of court because the warrant has no jurisdiction in law. Justice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, had Wednesday last week, issued a bench warrant for the arrest of Prof. Mahmood Yakubu over his alleged persistent refusal to honour summons to appear in court with respect of a suit involving the Anambra State chapter of the PDP. Justice Pam had summoned Yakubu to explain  why he should not be committed to prison for refusing to recognize the Oguebego-led faction of the PDP in Anambra State in compliance with a judgment the Supreme Court delivered in December 2014. However, Counsel to Prof. Yakubu,  Chief Adegboyega Awomolo, (SAN) told journalists in Abuja yesterday that he had filed  an appeal  at the Court of Appeal in Abuja in which he claimed nullified the arrest warrant. He said as head of the electoral empire, Prof. Yakubu  was not served any order of the court as required by law, and could not be accused of  disobeying  the court.
