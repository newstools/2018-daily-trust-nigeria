Telecom firm, Globacom, has called on Nigerians to exhibit the spirit of tolerance and love during the celebration of the 2018 Eid-El-Kabir. The feast of Eid-El-Kabir, also known as Eid al-Adha, is an important annual Muslim feast usually marked between the 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th day of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah of the lunar Islamic calendar. This year’s celebrations come up on August 21 and 22 and the Federal Governrment has since declared the two days as public holidays. But Globacom, in a press statement on Monday, called on the Ummah to imbibe the virtues of humility and sacrifice as exemplified by the life of Prophet Muhammed (S.A.W). Globacom said: “We call on them to use the occasion to continue to live up to the code of belief of their faith through acts of charity, peaceful co-existence with their neighbours and obedience to the injunctions of the Holy Quran”. The Eid-el-Kabir celebrations commence with the Hajj, when pilgrims to Mecca in Saudi Arabia descend from Mount Arafat. The Grandmasters of Data congratulated all those who embarked on the Holy Pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia this year and asked for Allah’s mercies as they travel back home. “We wish all Muslims a very happy Eid-el-Kabir celebration and assure  all Nigerians of a delightful communications experience during the holiday by providing high quality service throughout the season and beyond,” Glo said.
