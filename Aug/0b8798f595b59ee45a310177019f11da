The flood caused by hours of heavy downpour last Thursday in Kaduna has claimed the lives of two brothers, Daily Trust has learnt. The boys were said to be between 12 and 16 years of age. It was gathered from neighbours at Ungwar Pama where family of the deceased reside that the duo had been declared missing after the rain on Thursday. “You know it rained almost through-out Thursday, so the two brothers went out during the rain and did not come back home. The boys are the only children of their parents,” a neighbour said. Their corpses were found by local divers in a river somewhere at Narayi, an area in Chikun local government area of the state. There was so much weeping when the remains of the two brothers were brought home before they were conveyed to Sabo cemetery for burial. When contacted, the executive secretary of Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Ben Kure, said his agency has not gotten any information about the incident. “So I cannot comment for now,” he said.
