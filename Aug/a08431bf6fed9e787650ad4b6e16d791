A middle-aged man, Femi James Adisa, will on September 3, 2018 know his fate on his request to have custody of his four-year-old son in the case he instituted against his wife at a grade C customary court sitting at Oja-Oba, Mapo, Ibadan. The court yesterday heard from the petitioner that since his wife, Adewunmi, left his house last year, she had been supplying his four-year-old son with alcoholic beverages which, he said, had been making him behave abnormally. Adisa added that since Adewunmi voluntarily moved out of his home last year, she had been denying him access to his son, adding he wasn’t comfortable with the kind of upbringing the boy was getting in the neighbourhood he was residing with his mother. He further alleged that Adewunmi had not been a faithful wife, and was so troublesome she was always fighting with neighbours. “She is not a faithful wife.  The mistake I made was that I knew her parents were not happy that I wanted to marry her but I still went ahead with the marriage. “She hasn’t been taking care of my child in her custody. She has been giving him alcoholic drinks, which made him addicted to alcohol. Please give me the custody of my son,” he begged. Adewunmi, however, said she should be the one to accuse Adisa of alcoholism “as he is a heavy drinker.” She said her husband never cared for the family, especially their son. “He didn’t have time for us and he used to beat me. We have been living separately for the past one year now. He came to pick the boy when he had an accident, that he wanted to take care of him. But he later told me I wouldn’t set my eyes on the boy again. My son never tasted alcohol as he claimed, but I don’t know if he used to give him when I was not at home,” she said. The president of the court, Chief Odunade Ademola, who condemned consumption of alcoholic drink by a teenager, adjourned the case till September 3, 2018 for judgment.
