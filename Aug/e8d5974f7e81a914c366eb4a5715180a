Nasawara State Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura yesterday promised to pay all outstanding allowances of youth corps members before the end of this month. He made the promise in Keffi during the closing ceremony of the orientation exercise for the 2018 Batch B Stream I corps members. Represented by his deputy, Silas Agara, the governor said: “We have taken proactive measures to ensure that all corps members affected are paid as when due from this August. I want to assure you all that as you go to resume in your host communities, your allowances will reach before the end of this month.” He advised the corps members to explore the diverse agricultural potentials in the state to have an alternative means of livelihood, contribute to the development of host communities and key into government’s commitment to stimulating the agricultural sector. NYSC Coordinator Zainab Isah urged the corps members to take full advantage of the Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) training learnt in the camp to be self-reliant.
