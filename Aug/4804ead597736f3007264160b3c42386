Members of the Kwankwasiyya group in Plateau State on Friday, trooped to the secretariat of the People’s Democratic Party in Jos where they declared support to the party and vowed to work for the success of the PDP in the 2019 general election. Members of the group, draped in the symbolic white attire and red cap were led by the Kwankwasiyya State Coordinator, Tokji John. John told Daily Trust that, “we visited the State Party Chairman, Hon. Damishi Sango to declare our support to the PDP in Plateau State. We were received warmly and we have assured the party that we will go to the various local governments and wards to start mobilisation because we would give our massive votes to the PDP.” He said it took the group this long to declare its support to the PDP because most of the group’s state exco were members of the All Progressives Congress and therefore, they needed to make consultations before taking a stand. He said  “43 out of the 45 members of the state exco are now fully with us in the PDP, except for two persons who are yet to join to us."
