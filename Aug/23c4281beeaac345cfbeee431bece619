The Divisional Police Officer  (DPO) in charge of Pen Cinema Police station, Harrison Nwabuisi, has been removed over allegations bordering around  corruption. Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, yesterday directed for his removal over a newspaper publication alleging gross professional misconduct during the Sallah day celebration. The DPO, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) and some of his boys were alleged to have been carrying out illegal raids and extorting money from innocent persons around Agege area. A statement by the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Chike Oti, noted that the attention of the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP Edgal Imohimi, was drawn to a Newspaper publication of Friday, August 24, 2018, captioned " Power-drunk Lagos DPO leads team to mosque, raid adherents, others." Oti said that in the publication the reporter, mentioned that the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Pen Cinema Police Division, Lagos State, Harrison Nwabuisi, has been conducting raids during which he allegedly arrested innocent residents and extorted money from them. He said that it was further reported that the police operation took place on Wednesday, being the last day of the Sallah holiday, at Alimi Ogunyemi Street, in the Ifako Ijaiye area and mentioned one Sheriff Aranjure as a prime witness to the alleged extortion by the DPO. "Sequel to the allegation, the CP has directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, DCP Yetunde Longe, to investigate the officer and other ranks against whom the allegation was made. He equally directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Administration, DCP Elkanah Ayuba, to recall the DPO to the Command Headquarters to allow unbiased investigation into the matter.  "While recognising the fact that raiding is a major crime fighting strategy of the police, given that it enables proactive intervention into a budding problem, the CP however said, that it must be purposeful, corruption free and Intelligence driven" he added
