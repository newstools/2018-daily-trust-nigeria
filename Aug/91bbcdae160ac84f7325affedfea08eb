The Kano State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the recent political alliance between the two former governors of the state, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau and Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, as a kangaroo union. APC Deputy Chairman in Kano, Shehu Maigari, who spoke in Kano yesterday, said the alliance would not affect the victory of the APC in the 2019 general elections. Maigari said the union would not last because the two politicians have different political ideologies and beliefs and could not work to achieve a common goal. He said, “politics is a game of ideology and like minds, but Shekarau and Kwankwaso are two different individuals with different beliefs, ideologies and are going towards different directions. “One should not expect these two individuals to work together to achieve a common goal. People are now waiting to see if Kwankwaso’s emotion will influence Shekarau’s actions. “Shekarau is being respected for his focused political ideologies, therefore, I wonder how he can sacrifice this respect for just self-centered interest.” The deputy chairman added that it has now become clear that both Shekarau and Kwankwaso were not protecting the interest of the electorate. Maigari also said that the defection of Senator Kwankwaso to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the APC would not add any value to the PDP in Kano State.
