A driver, Solomon Boniface Okon, has been arrested by the Oyo State police command for allegedly stealing his employer’s vehicle, a Honda CRV with registration number LSR 782 DF. The vehicle was recovered in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State after it had been sold to a man the police described as Okon’s accomplice. The Oyo State police Commissioner, Abiodun Odude, who paraded the suspects at a press conference in Ibadan yesterday, said Okon led policemen to a hotel where the car was recovered. Also paraded were a bricklayer, Daniel Segun, who allegedly robbed female students of Ladoke Akintola University, Ogbomoso, in their hostels, and a suspected internet fraudster (yahoo boy), Aremu Mayowa, said to be an undergraduate of the same institution, who was arrested for alleged rape. Other suspects paraded were two suspected armed robbers, Waris Lukman and Sodiq Olabode, who were allegedly stealing motorcycles in the Olomi area of the state, and another suspected internet fraudster, Abiodun David, who was nabbed for allegedly placing fake advertisements online to defraud people. Odude said all the suspects had confessed to the crimes they allegedly committed. “Those not yet arraigned in court will be arraigned after conclusion of investigations. Apart from the achievements mentioned above, the command, through intensive stop-and-search exercises and robust intelligence, also recovered no fewer than 10 assorted stolen vehicles. These vehicles have been released to their owners,” he said. Odude said, “The clampdown on criminal elements will be sustained beyond the yuletide and the general election periods. This is to ensure security during the festive season, and, thereafter, safety for the electorate, candidates, INEC staff and other participants in the electoral process.”
