Governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Sir Stanley Amuchie, has expressed optimism that he will reclaim his victory at the party’s governorship primary election. He claimed that the party wrongly gave the ticket to Senator Ifeanyi Araraume. Speaking to our correspondent, after hearing in the suit he filed against Araraume, Amuchie said that he had refrained from campaigning so as not to breach the restraining order of the court. He said: “The Court today reiterated its earlier directive that both parties should maintain the status quo in order not to tamper with the rest of the matter. “Today’s Court session was a continuation of the case we filed asking the Court to cause my name not to be removed as Governorship Candidate of APGA based on the gubernatorial primary election conducted on October 7, 2018 at Concorde Hotel, Owerri, which we clearly won as testified by both INEC and Police observer teams. “We know that the main aim and strategy of the defendant is to delay the course of justice and frustrate us. But we will neither be frustrated nor deterred in upholding the ticket which belongs to us legally and constitutionally.” He asked his supporters to keep hope alive, stressing that, “we have great confidence in the judiciary and we believe that we are standing on the pedestal of justice having met the requirements necessary to fly the flag of our great party in the 2019 Governorship election in Imo State.” Imo APGA gov'ship aspirant denies supporting Ihedioha Imo 2019: APGA has no Gov'ship candidate yet - Onyeagucha ‘APGA yet to field gov’ship candidate in Imo’
