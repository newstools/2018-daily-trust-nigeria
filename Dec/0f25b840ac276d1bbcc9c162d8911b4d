The APC governorship candidate in Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, yesterday, expressed confidence that Governor Ibikunle Amosun will raise his hand at the flag off of his campaign. This is despite his, Amosun’s, stiff resistance that led to crisis and defection in the ruling party. Abiodun spoke, yesterday, at his home town, Iperu-Remo, Ogun State where he formally unveiled his running mate, Engr. Naimot Salako-Oyedele. The APC gubernatorial candidate said there was still enough time to nip the crisis rocking the party in the bud ahead of the next election. Analysts believe Abiodun’s prediction might be wishful thinking considering that Governor Amosun had since endorsed the candidature of his preferred candidate, Adekunle Akinlade, who had since dumped the APC to the Allied People’s Movement (APM) and picked its gubernatorial ticket. Amosun had categorically stated that he would not support any gubernatorial candidate other than Akinlade in the next election. Yet Abiodun said he believed Amosun as “the leader of the party and APC governor” would be part of his campaign and raise his hand as candidate during the flag off the campaign. The oil magnate promised to build on the “massive road infrastructure” which Amosun has started with a view to building “a more friendly state for investors.” He added that if elected, his administration would prioritise education, health care services, youth and women empowerment as well as agriculture in order to transform Ogun “into the food basket state.”
