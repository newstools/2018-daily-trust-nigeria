President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the security and law enforcement agencies to ensure a free, fair and credible general elections next year. The President gave this charge in a Christmas message he personally signed on Monday. He urged them to secure the sanctity of the ballot box and ensure that the outcome of the polls reflects the will of the Nigerian people. “My avowed commitment to free, fair, credible and violence-free polls is not a ruse or yet another vain political promise. My word is my bond. “It is a sworn declaration on the advancement of Nigeria, the future and safety of our young and unborn generations. “Let us tell the world that, indeed, something good can come out from Nigeria. And it will happen, as we all team up to make it happen,” Buhari said.
