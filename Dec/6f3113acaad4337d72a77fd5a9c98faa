The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, has warned that anyone arrested making love in a car in any public place would be arrested and prosecuted. Edgal gave the warning yesterday against the background of an online publication declaring that sex in a car in a public place was not a crime in Nigeria. Edgal, who spoke through the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, said that “the attention of the Command has been drawn to an online publication credited to @POLICENG PCRRU to the effect that sex in a car in a public place is not a crime in Nigeria provided that the location is not a place of worship, parties are at least 18 years, the act is consensual and both parties are of the opposite sex.” Edgal added that sequel to the development, he has been advised by the Director of Public Prosecution of the Lagos State Ministry of Justice and the Legal Department of the State Police Command, Panti, Yaba, with relevant sections of the law. “The authorities of the Lagos State police command, hereby, declare that the assertion that sex in a car in a public place is not a crime in Nigeria is misplaced as the provisions of the Criminal Law of Lagos State prohibit such acts in public even if it is done with consent of the other party,” he said.
