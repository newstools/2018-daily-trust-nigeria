Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), Abdulkadir Saidu, yesterday, assured Nigerians of uninterrupted petroleum products supply and distribution especially during the festive period and beyond. Saidu appealed to motorists and other petrol consumers to desist from panic-buying, as PPPRA, he said was working hard with other agencies of government to ensure that there was no shortfall in the supply and distribution of petroleum products nationwide. The executive secretary in a statement he personally signed, also refuted the rumour of an imminent increase in the pump price of petrol, adding that the retail price remains at the subsisting price cap of N145 per litre. He further added that PPPRA would continue to carry out its oversight function of monitoring depots and filling stations across the country, to ensure adherence to the regulated price and to nip in the bud other forms of sharp practices at retail outlets.
