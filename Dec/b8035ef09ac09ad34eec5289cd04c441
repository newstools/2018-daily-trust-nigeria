A group under the aegis of Coalition of PDP Support Groups in Sokoto State says no amount of intimidation will deter its support for Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. “We want to assure our teeming supporters and well-wishers that no amount of pressure, oppression or threats will make us to change our support for Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and his lieutenants until we succeed in returning our dear state, the seat of the Caliphate back to its glorious past,” the group said. Coordinator of the group Muhammad Akibu Dalhatu, who said this in a statement in Sokoto, alleged plot by the opposition APC in the state to use federal might to intimidate PDP leaders. But the APC spokesman, Alhaji Bello Danchadi, dismissed the allegation of intimidation, saying “the recent tour of PDP and negative public response they encountered from people has worsened their desperation.” He added that the PDP was afraid of the popularity of the APC leader in the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko.
