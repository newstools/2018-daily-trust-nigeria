The death toll from a volcano-triggered tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 220, with over 800 people injured, officials said on Sunday. “222 people are dead, 843 people are injured and 28 people are missing,” Indonesia’s national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. “This number is predicted to increase because not all victims have been successfully evacuated, not all health centres have reported victims and not all locations have got complete data,” he added. The tsunami hit both sides of Indonesia’s Sunda Strait on Saturday, sending a wall of water crashing about 20 metres inland and sweeping away hundreds of homes and hotels, officials and witnesses have said.
