The Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) in Ekiti State, yesterday, condemned a faction of the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, led by Chief Reuben Fasoranti, for allegedly betraying the South West people by endorsing former Vice President Atiku Abubakar for the 2019 presidential election. The Chief Reuben Fasoranti faction had recently declared support for the candidature of Atiku “because of his promise to restructure the country and adopt true federalism.” In a statement, yesterday, by the CNPP Acting State Chairman, Deacon Olu Akomolafe, in Ado Ekiti, the group said the people of the South West would resist attempt to trade with the collective destiny of the region. “We won’t allow these leaders to sell Yoruba and rubbish the race’s good name because of politics,” the statement said. “Yoruba nationals will not subject themselves to any evil force out to tarnish the image of the race and put it to disrepute. “The dividends of democracy being enjoyed under the Buhari-led progressive government should be encouraged. All that Yoruba have gained under the Buhari-led government have never happened in Nigeria’s history. “The vice president’s slot which Yoruba are enjoying shall be guarded jealously except where any presidential candidate can provide a better position than that. “Everyone could attest to the role being played by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the honour he has brought to us as a people,” the statement said.
