The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has described the late President Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari as a nationalist and patriot who has respect for dignity of labour. “He holds a special place in our hearts. For instance, he signed into law the National Minimum Wage Act of 1981 that provided for a new national minimum wage of N125 which was equivalent to about $200. “It took more than deft move and political will to execute this. It took the milk of human kindness in Shagari and his deep appreciation of the dignity of labour and value of the human life to do this,”  a statement by the NLC President Ayuba Wabba said yesterday. “To truly appreciate the value of what Shagari did for workers way back then without a bloody fight, let us pause and reflect on the value of the present national minimum wage of N18,000 which is $49; and the new national minimum wage of N30,000 (equivalent to $82) which is due since 2016,” the workers said. The labour said Shagari was humble, considerate and broad-minded which made him popular amongst the ordinary people. Wabba said Shagari initiated some of the landmark projects including iron and steel and petrochemicals in his quest to make Nigeria an industrial hub, saying if not for the coup that removed him from power in 1983, Shagari would have made Nigeria highly industrialized. Wabba also commended him for his national housing scheme, leading to the building of low-cost houses for workers across the then 19 states of the federation.
