A coalition of Buhari support organisations, yesterday, gathered in Abuja to celebrate and pray for President Muhammadu Buhari on his 76th birthday. The birthday event, tagged: “Love Feast and Prayer for Buhari at 76” was held at Millennium Park in Abuja and attended by over 1,000 supporters of the president. The supporters, under the auspices of ‘Buharists Hangout’, prayed for the president, cut a birthday cake for him and presented a birthday card and a cash donation to support his re-election campaign for 2019 elections. Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, who received the gifts on behalf of the president, thanked the group for their support and prayers. “For people to gather here on their own to mark the president’s birthday in his absence is an indication that they are proud of him. This kind of thing is not common in our political history, which shows that there are people who wish Mr President well against all odds,” he said. The lead administrator of Buharists Hangout, Dr Uche Diala, said the event was to thank God and appreciate the president for his good work across the country. “We have a president who had a health challenge, but God healed him, and he came out stronger for us. This celebration today is to felicitate and identify with Mr. President because he means well for our dear country,” he said. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, urged the group to not only celebrate the president but also emulate his character. Mustapha was represented by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Political Matters, Gideon Sammani.
