Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara has said that patience and perseverance of his constituents gave him the opportunity to serve them and the country. He disclosed this while speaking at a ceremony organised in his honour by Gubbiya community of Bogoro Local Government Area of Bauchi State.  He said the people of his Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency consistently voted for him to represent them until he became speaker in 2015. “You have done everything to me by voting me three times. There is nothing I can do for you but to do everything I can do to bring developmental projects that will make your life better.
Your patience and perseverance gave me the opportunity to serve you and other Nigerians,” he said. “Because of what you have been doing to me, I have a responsibility to protect your interest and that is what I have been doing. I will never be involved in anything that will jeopardise your lives or that of any Nigerian. “If you have been sending a different person to the House of Representatives every four years, we wouldn’t have been where we are today in terms of development. You choose continuity and development and voted for me three times,” he said. Dogara said he had attracted road projects worth over N60 billion to the area which linked Bauchi to other neighbouring states and opened up the area in order to improve the socio-economic wellbeing of the people. In his welcome address, the chairman, Gubbiya Area Development Association (GADA), Mr. Bulus Titus, said Dogara had done a lot for his constituents and deserved accolades in appreciation. 2019: Dogara yields to constituents’ request to recontest Reps seat I left because APC has failed Nigerians — Dogara Dogara''s aide resigns, denies working against the speaker
