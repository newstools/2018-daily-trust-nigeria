The Acting President of the Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Comrade Rayyanu Isayaku Turunku, has appealed to Governor Nasir El-Rufai to allow the councils to take over payment of salaries of their staff from the State Ministry of Local Government. He said this was to help eliminate the issue of delay in payment of salaries. Turunku made this appeal while speaking during an interaction with members of the union to mark the Christmas celebration on Monday in Kaduna. He commended the state government for evolving effective monitoring measures of the activities of Local Government Councils in the state, which he said, has brought about visible changes in the performance of the councils. Comrade Rayyanu averred that there was an indication that the Local Government Councils had imbibed the culture of prudent management of resources by focusing more on projects that have direct bearing on the needs and welfare of the populace. While commending the governor for the effort to ginger the councils towards effective service delivery, he urged the state government to assist the Local Government Councils to settle all outstanding salaries and leave grant arrears to alleviate the hardship of affected staff.
