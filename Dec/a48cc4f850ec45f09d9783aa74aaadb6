The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) on Friday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to as a matter of urgency sanction the alleged looters in his government. The body equally asked Buhari to re-open alleged bribery scandal against Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, in order to protect  the nation’s integrity. In a statement made available to our correspondent in Abeokuta by NANS spokesman, Adeyemi Amoo, it noted that a number of corrupt officials have been exposed and there is need to get rid of them in the Buhari-led government. Amoo expressed dismay that Ganduje’s scandal has been “stylishly been swept and kept under the carpet” in the name of party loyalty. “However, we have watched and monitored with keen interest, that those exposed and subjected to probe/investigations so far are those looters that chooses not to hide under the APC. “NANS hereby assures the president, that if he fails to address the Kano Governor’s scandal amongst other alleged looters hiding under him, in the pretence of loyalty, we shall sensitise our constituents (NANS) on the risk of re-electing President Muhammad Buhari in the coming general elections,” the NANS publicist said. He, however, commended Buhari “for his steadfastness in fighting and exposing some popular looters that have partook in looting the resources of this country.” Utomi, Balarabe Musa, AYCF task FG on looters list Viral Video: NANS gives Buhari 7-day ultimatum to probe Ganduje Buhari right not to release looters names – Sagay
