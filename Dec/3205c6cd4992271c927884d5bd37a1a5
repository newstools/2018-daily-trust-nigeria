Five suspected informants of kidnappers have been mobbed to death in Danjibga village, Tsafe local government area of Zamfara State. Danjibga community had suffered series of deadly attacks and kidnappings by suspected armed bandits and cattle rustlers in recent times. Three weeks ago, a woman was delivered of her baby, less than five hours in the kidnappers’ den. She was kidnapped from her matrimonial home while in excruciating labour pains. Last Thursday, the chairman of the local government, Alhaji Aliyu Abubakar claimed that about 40 people were killed and more than 1,700 persons displaced in the local government in the past two weeks. The vice chairman of the local government, who is also a native inhabitant of the community, Alhaji Aliyu Yunusa Danjibga, told Daily Trust that the suspected informants were identified and slained by the residents after the community had suffered series of deadly raids and kidnappings. “Kidnappers are still holding a lot of people in captivity apart from those who regained freedom after ransom was paid,” he added.
