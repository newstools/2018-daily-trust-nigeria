The Management of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) says it is keen on fixing all access roads to all the country’s sea ports. This, according to the agency, became imperative due to the negative impact that traffic gridlock occasioned by bad roads is having on the nation’s ports and by extension the economy. In 2018, NPA said N4.34 billion was budgeted for the rehabilitation of the road that leads to the Lagos Port Complex. It said other roads would be done in 2019. The NPA Managing Director, Hadiza Bala Usman, while reeling out her score card in 2018, said NPA also ensured the review of the Port concession agreements for seamless collaboration and sustained development of the maritime industry Usman also said NPA had commenced the process for International Standard Organisation (ISO) 9001 certification of the nation. “We accomplished the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding  (MOU) with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH) for the reconstruction of the Port access road. “The project cost is put at N4.34 billion. Nigerian Ports Authority’s contribution is N1.829 billion,” Usman said.
