The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) said it has invested N19 billion as capital expenditure to improve its networks and services between 2014 and year 2018. AEDC Director of Corporate Services, Mr Abimbola Odubiyi disclosed this on Thursday when he received the Senate Committee on Privatisation led by the Vice Chairman, Dr. Yahaya Abdullahi during an oversight visit to the AEDC headquarters in Abuja. Odubiyi who represented the Managing Director, Mr Ernest Mupwaya also said average power supply in Abuja metropolis is now at 18 hours. “In Abuja area,  the improvement in power supply has gone up tremendously and there are hardly people who complain that they don’t have power. There are places enjoying 24 hours, others are 12 hours but in Abuja metropolis, the average is 18 hours,” he noted. Odubiyi said before the power sector privatisation in 2013, about 90 million were not connected to the national grid and the losses were over 50 per cent. However with the over N19bn investments, the Distribution Company (DisCo) has reduced its Aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) losses to 24.92 per cent by October 2018 while being rated among the three top performing DisCos. On metering, he said 51% customers have been metered while 49% are unmetered. So far, 22,617 meters procured this year are being installed by June 2019. With the Meter Assets Providers (MAP) scheme in 2019, AEDC hopes to attain 100% metering level of its about 1,023 million enumerated customers. “We are confident that with these four metering strategies, close to 100 per cent of our customers will be metered,” Odubiyi noted.
