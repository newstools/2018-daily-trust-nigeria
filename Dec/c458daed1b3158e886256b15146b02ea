A Kano based businessman Alhaji Sabitu Muhammad Yahaya has urged  youths in the state to embrace farming to reduce rate of unemployment among them. Yahaya, who is the chairman of Jifatu Enterprises Company, made the plea at Jifatu day at the ongoing 39th Kano State Trade fair. He said the youths should start thinking about what they can do as government and the private companies in the country could not provide them with the kind jobs they are looking for. “Everyone should be awake and understand the fact that the era of looking for white-color jobs has passed, so the youths are left to create jobs for themselves.  I call on you to try farming as it yields positive result,” he said. Alhaji Yahaya said when the present administration decided to focus its attention on agriculture, he welcomed the idea and started investing in the sector and his investment was yielding positive results. “In the beginning when I started investing in farming I didn’t expect  much, but I am so amazed for what is coming out from the sector, that is why I sells the idea of farming to everyone I have the opportunity to meet” He added that the agricultural sector had opened a door for him to participate in food processing business which added value to his company. “I used to sell my farm produce in markets, but early last year we started processing what we grow. Now we produce semovita, wheat flour, rice, and many more, this has added a value to our companies,” he said.
