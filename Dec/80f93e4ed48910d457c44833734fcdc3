The Ogun State Manager of the federal government’s Home-Grown School Feeding programme, Mrs Tinuola Sopeju, has disclosed that 30,000 residents of the state have benefited from the programme in two years. Sopeju stated this in Abeokuta while speaking with journalists at a joint year-end high-level dissemination meeting on the programme in the state. The Home-Grown School Feeding programme is one of the social intervention programmes of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, and Ogun was one of the few states it was piloted two years ago. Adepeju explained that 25,000 farmers and 3,390 food vendors, transporters, butchers and others were benefiting from the programme directly and had been receiving their salaries from the federal government. “We employed Ogun farmers to supply us different food items like fish, meat and other edibles, and we also employed some food vendors, who are also involved in cooking nutritious food for the students. These employees get their salaries directly from the federal government at the end of the month. “We are more bothered about the health of the pupils. That’s why we focus on preparing good food for them, and this has led to tremendous increase in the number of pupils in public schools. “The programme has recorded huge success, which has made other states in the federation to visit Ogun to learn from that success,” she said. The Commissioner for Special Duties in the state, Adeleke Adewolu, noted that non-governmental organisations had really helped in financing the programme and its monitoring across the state.
