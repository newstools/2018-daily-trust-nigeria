The CBN’s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, in a statement reiterated that the Bilateral Currency Swap Agreement (BCSA) with the Peoples’ Bank of China was achieving its major objectives of reducing the use and influence of a third currency transactions; reducing the pressure on the naira exchange rate; easing trade transactions between Nigeria and China and maintaining financial market stability in Nigeria.
