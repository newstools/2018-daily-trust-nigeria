Nigeria has pleaded with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to help it combat extremist Islamic ideology among the youth in the northeast. The Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan-Ali, made the pleas in Maiduguri yesterday at the flag-off of the distribution of relief materials donated by King Salman Ibn Abdul-Aziz Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre to displaced persons in Born and Yobe States. “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia should please help Nigeria in the propagation and promotion of the right Islamic ideals to the youth in the Northeast in order to eradicate the warped Boko Haram Islamic ideology in the region,” he pleaded. The minister, who said blamed insurgency on poverty caused by bad governance, also appealed to Saudi Arabia to share defence intelligence and information with Nigeria on insurgency and terror. Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State assured that the relief materials would be judiciously distributed.
