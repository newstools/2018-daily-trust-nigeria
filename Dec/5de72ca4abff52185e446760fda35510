The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Fulani socio-cultural association, has said it will soon decide who to back between President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC and his main challenger, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the PDP. The National President of the organisation, Alhaji Bello Abdullahi Bodejo, and National Secretary, Engr. Saleh Alhassan, made the declaration, yesterday, in Abuja at a news conference. Their comments were coming on the heels of a two-day national delegates meeting of the association. “We have ensured that our members are massively registered in the elections and should exercise their franchise in a peaceful manner wherever they would cast their votes. “We expect our members to fully turn out to cast their votes. We are happy that the stereotyping of Fulani herdsmen has gone down due to the fact that the two perceived leading presidential candidates are Fulani. “The polity has benefited from this development as we now have campaigns being issue-based and not on ethnicity, religion or other primordial sentiments. We believe this is healthy for the nation. “On who we are going to support, we are still weighing what the two perceived leading candidates would bring on the table, what they have in stock for the pastoralists that are facing numerous challenges across the country and when we finished our assessments, we will invite the world to know our direction. But for now, we are asking our members to get ready with their PVCs and wait where we can negotiate the best for them, especially on their economic livelihood. “We would look at the agenda that the two or any of the presidential candidates has for our members,” Bodejo said.
