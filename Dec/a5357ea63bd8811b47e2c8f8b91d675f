The governorship candidate of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in Oyo State, Akogun Sharafadeen Alli, has charged the electorate to collect money from those he called “moneybag politicians” but ensure that they vote with their conscience. He also condemned the security levies imposed on churches and mosques by the present administration in the state. Alli, who spoke during an interactive session with reporters in Ibadan, over the weekend, said people should be wary of any governor opposing the implementation of the proposed local government autonomy. “If our local government is not autonomous, we will continue to have problems. Any governor who is against local government autonomy is wicked. I will support local government autonomy as a governor because it is the only way the masses can have a sense of belonging in governance,” he said. Alli, a former secretary to the state government, who also picked holes in education policies of the state government, said the payment of N1000 by primary and secondary schools pupils was not in tandem with the regulation of the Universal Basic Education (UBEC).
