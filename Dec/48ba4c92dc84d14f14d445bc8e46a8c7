The minister of Communications, Barrister Adebayo Shittu, says he will be a bastard to support the APC governorship candidate in Oyo State, Chief Adebayo Adelabu, after he was defrauded out of the primary election. Shittu disclosed this on Wednesday while fielding questions from journalists in Abuja. When asked whether he would support the preferred candidate of Governor Abiola Ajimobi in 2019, the minister said, “I think it doesn’t arise. I will be a bastard to be defrauded out of a primary process and to simply behave like a slave! It won’t make sense. I have been a foundation member of APC and I have twice aspired to be governor. In 2011, I aspired and I was defeated by the incumbent. “In 2015, I aspired I was defrauded from the primary at that time and I challenged that process which produced Governor Ajimobi who won for a second term. I went to court; we were still in court when my appointment was announced. That made me to abandon that case and the governor, instead of him to thank his God that he was relieved of the case, started a campaign against my confirmation by the Senate. “He (Ajimobi) was going around, blackmailing me, urging senators not to confirm me. At the end of the day, common sense prevailed, I was confirmed. And ever since, he has continued to attack me. And what is the basis of the attack? He believes that, which is wrong anyway, that he and his cohorts cannot have a Buhari at the federal level and another Buhari in me at the state level. He told people close to him that if Shittu succeeds, he would be in jail. Why he thinks so, I still don’t know.” Shittu rejects indirect primaries in Oyo APC 2019 guber race: Minister gets presidency’s nod to contest I’ll succeed Ajimobi in 2019 as Oyo governor – Communications Minister
