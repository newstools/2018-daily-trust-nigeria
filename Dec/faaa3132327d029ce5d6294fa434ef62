Uber has introduced a new application to increase efficiency of driver-partners and enable them focus on driving while using the app. Also, the app has been made to be less complex and complicated to allow drivers to focus more on driving, according to Uber Greenlight Operations Manager for West Africa, O’Yoma Ukueku. In a release made available to our correspondent, Ukueku who said the new is increasing efficiency among thousands of Uber driver-partners said it It also provides them with real-time updates on market conditions around them and opportunities for more trips nearby. They can also choose to navigate to such nearby with just a tap. The Manager said having criss-crossed the West African region especially Lagos, Abuja, Accra and Kumasi, the feedback from driver-partners on the new app has been encouraging. He said, “At the Greenlight Hubs, driver-partners are offered information sessions, tailored workshops focusing on training and skills development such as safety tips, crime prevention and financial tips. Potential driver-partners are also assisted at the Greenlight Hubs through the onboarding process. In my recent interactions with them, one theme that has come as consistent feedback is their reaction to the newly launched Uber driver app. For many drivers using the app globally and in West Africa there’s a general consensus that the new features provide an improved experience on the road and allows them to use the app more efficiently whether on the road or off.” Also included in the app, according to him, is an earning tracker that allows drivers to know how much they earned in their previous trip, to allow them to track their progress toward their financial goals. “At Uber, we remain committed to creating business and economic opportunities for driver-partners and we are always looking at ways in which we can make their experience more memorable and continue to stimulate their growth as small business owners”, he added.
