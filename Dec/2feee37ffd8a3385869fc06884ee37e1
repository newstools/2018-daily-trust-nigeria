The Justice Must Prevail Party (JMPP) has pledged to eliminate corruption and ensure absolute security in Nigeria through the instrumentality of the covenant of 12 Pillars of Oath of the party. To achieve this, the national chairman of the party, Dr. Olusegun Gidansujada Ijagbemi, said the party would build a 26-feet-tall-concrete wall round the country to guard against Boko Haram, smuggling and other criminal activities at border areas. He stated this when the 689 candidates contesting for various positions on the platform of the party were sworn through an oath barefooted at the partyâ€™s convention in Abuja. According to him, the oath was to rescue Nigeria from bad leadership.
