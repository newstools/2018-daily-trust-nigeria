A man, Abayomi Francis, was yesterday brought before an Ogba magistrate court, Lagos, for allegedly defrauding one Morufat Amodu of the sum of N550,000. Francis, whose address was not given, was charged with a two-count charge of false pretext and stealing. The prosecutor, Inspector Josephine Ikhayere, told the court that the accused committed the offences on June 29, 2018 at about 2.30pm at Alagbado, Lagos. Ikhayere said that the accused collected N550,000 from Amodu under the pretext of helping her to procure a Canadian passport and visa. Francis, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The magistrate gave him a N200,000 bail, with two sureties and adjourned the case till February 6, 2019 for mention.
