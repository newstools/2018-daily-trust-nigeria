Unai Emery expects Brighton to pose a similar physical challenge to Burnley as the Arsenal head coach aims for a Boxing Day victory at the AMEX Stadium. The Gunners secured a 3-1 win over Burnley on Saturday with striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored twice, claiming he had never played in a game that was as feisty. There were a number of flashpoints and Clarets boss Sean Dyche afterwards claimed that Arsenal players had dived during what proved to be a fairly hot-tempered afternoon. Arsenal boss Unai Emery expects the match at Brighton to be another feisty affair, like last season’s. The win was enough to take Arsenal level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea and Emery expects Brighton to offer a similar challenge to his players. “Brighton is the same, a very tough match physically, very organised and, like with Burnley, a very good coach who is working very well.”  New Arsenal boss to sack Arsene Wenger''s men in dramatic staff shake-up Arsenal to dump Manchester City coach for surprise candidate Arsenal pick between Ousmane Dembele and Kingsley Coman
