The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Lagos state, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Tuesday visited the paediatric section of the Gbagada General Hospital to felicitate with children battling various health conditions as well as newborns as part of his Christmas celebration. He also visited the Gbaja Hospital for Maternal and Child Care in Surulere, where he donated gifts and medical consumables to all newborns and their parents. Speaking with adult patients at the Gbagada General Hospital, Sanwo-Olu cheered them up and prayed for their speedy recovery. He said the gesture was informed by the spirit of Christmas and his personal conviction to lift the downtrodden in their times of need. He noted that his visit to the hospitals was deliberately planned on the Christmas day to put smile on the faces of families that could not celebrate because of ailments. “It is Christmas day and this season is significant because it teaches us love, compassion and selflessness. “While majority of us have our family members and friends with us to mark the day, we need to understand that several families are in pain because their loved ones are battling various ailments at the hospital. “So, it’s no Christmas for these people because they need to be with their ailing family members “On a day like this, I thought it necessary to identify with these families and celebrate with them. “I believe this gesture will cheer them up and give them reasons to be happy. “We hope that the little we have come to share with them today will strengthen them to get out of the sickbed quicker and better,” Sanwo-Olu said. In appreciation, family members of the patients gathered in groups and prayed for him for identifying with them in their low moments.
