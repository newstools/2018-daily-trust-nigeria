Afropop sensation, Ayodeji Balogun aka Wizkid, thrilled spectators at a sold-out show at the Transcorp Hilton in Abuja on Sunday night. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that thousands of Abuja residents thronged the show tagged ‘Wizkid Live In Concert’. The event, which was organised by Play Network, caused a traffic gridlock at the Wuse area as revellers turned out in thousands  to watch the ‘Ojuelegba’ crooner perform. In his electrifying performance, Wizkid took the crowd on a memory ride, singing his hit songs from the early ‘Tease Me’ and ‘Ojuelegba’ to newest ‘Soco’. The mostly-reserved Abuja crowd was obviously loosened up at the concert as they sang along at the top of their voices and danced as he performed. Reacting to the concert, guests took to social media to appreciate Wizkid for the performance: @Dres_knowsbest tweeted, “I’ve waited 5 years to see @wizkidayo live and it was amazing!! Thank u wizzes for grabbing my phone!” @PaulGaje said, “@wizkidayo made my night. Please come again.” @ZhinnEmmanuel tweeted, “Thank you so much @wizkidayo That was amazing.” NAN reports that the concert came after Wizkid’s performance in Port Harcourt on Friday. (NAN) He is set to perform at ‘Wizkid Experience’ on Dec. 19 and ‘Made in Lagos’ concert on Dec. 23.
