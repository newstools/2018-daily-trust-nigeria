Secure-D-Future International Initiative, an NGO, has expressed commitment to rehabilitating victims of insurgency, drug abuse, rape and other forms of trauma through sustained counselling. The convener of the NGO, Mrs Sa’adatu Adamu, said in Abuja, on Monday, that trauma was one of the major factors responsible for abnormal behaviour in victims of insurgency, rape and domestic violence. Adamu said insecurity could lead to trauma and trauma may cause certain mindset, adding that many people were undergoing a lot of situations. She added that “we want to see a situation where people can think positively and in a better way psychologically.” Secure the future is a growing NGO that focuses on reforming minds. “We thought it wise to give back to the society because we feel that every Nigerian, regardless of his or her social background, religion and ethic group, should have a good life and should be able to secure his or her future. “So, we say let’s see what we can do in trying to help victims of violence, insurgency, rape and other vices to reform their minds and help them understand the purpose of life. “Most times we dream big, we think big but the truth is if we don’t build, you can’t secure, so we are trying to help people to build the future so that they can secure it,” Adamu said. She said the NGO was working with international bodies to provide psychosocial support to victims of insurgency, rape drug abuse, domestic violence and others. “We are trying to actually see that this country can get better. We see a lot of people going through substance abuse. “The truth is mindset, and some individuals are influenced not because they want to; but because they don’t have a mind of their own,” she added.  -NAN How Yobe property market is changing after insurgency ‘We Were Violated and Forced to Keep Quiet’ Checking prevalence of rape cases in Osun
