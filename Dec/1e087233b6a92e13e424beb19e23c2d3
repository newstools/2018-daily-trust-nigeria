Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State has cautioned the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole to stop abusing the ex President Olusegun Obasanjo. Okorocha lamented that the manner Oshiomhole has been abusing sitting governors and former president was unbecoming of any chairman of a political party with a national outlook. Okorocha, in a statement signed by His Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, accused Oshiomhole of taking rascality too far. “Chief Olusegun Obasanjo is the former President of the Country. And no matter the provocation or his political activities this time, Oshiomhole should have considered his status as the former President of the Country in talking about him, and should have exercised caution in addressing him. Saying that God would punish the former President was never advisable. This should not be the language of APC.
. “The party’s national chairman has, in less than six months, enthroned the culture of rascality into the party and the development is not good for the Party. APC is not known for rascality and abuses. And the earlier he is called to order the better for the party.” Okorocha said that since Buhari became president he has never used any foul language on any Nigerian, low or high, and that is the best way to go and asked Oshiomhole to borrow a leaf from Mr. President.
