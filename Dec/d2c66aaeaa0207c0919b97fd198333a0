The FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has said a lot can be achieved by committing more resources into capacity building and equipping its volunteers to effectively prevent and respond to disasters in their respective communities. The Director General of FEMA, Abbas G. Idriss, said this at the celebration of the 2018 International Volunteer Day which was marked with a walk around Asokoro District at the weekend. Idriss said since the adoption of the UN resolution to recognise volunteers 35 years ago, over one billion people from various backgrounds across the globe were linked by the common spirit of volunteerism that defied difficulties and continued to strive towards creating a safer, conducive and peaceful world. He said the theme for the 2018 day was: “Volunteers Build Resilient Communities”, which highlighted the importance of volunteers and the critical role they could play in strengthening communities to withstand or recover from the impact of disasters, as well as contribute to national development. The FEMA DG said the theme justified the agency’s community-based disaster management strategy that placed its over 300 volunteers at the centre as first responders in their communities across the six area councils of the FCT.
