The president of Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Kabila, plans to stay in politics when he steps down after elections on Dec. 23 and does not rule out running again for president in 2023, he told Reuters in an interview on Sunday. “Why don’t we wait for 2023 … to envision anything,” said a relaxed, smiling Kabila in a rare interview at the presidential palace, “In life as in politics, I don’t rule out anything.” International observers say insecurity will make holding elections difficult in the vast equatorial country and create an opportunity for Kabila’s coalition to cheat, especially with the use of new voting machines. Kabila said Congo was ready to hold fair elections. “We intend to make the elections as close to perfection as they can possibly be,” he said.
