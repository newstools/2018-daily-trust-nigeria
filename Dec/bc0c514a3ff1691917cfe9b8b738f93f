The lawmaker representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani has reacted to the uproar experienced on the floor of the National Assembly while President Muhammadu Buhari was presenting the 2019 proposed budget. At the presentation which held before a joint session of the National Assembly on Wednesday, lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition party, took to cheers and jeers while the President tabled the budget. As the President reeled out achievements of the present government, members of the opposition PDP booed while their APC counterparts praising their principal. In reaction to the lack of decorum which characterized the budget presentation, Senator Sani said it is ‘absurd’ that lawmakers should behave in such a manner when a major legislative process was ongoing. He said: “The Budget Presentation was a theater of the absurd, one side of the opera occupied by the oleaginous and obsequious choristers craving for the attention of President Buhari, cheering even a sip of water, and the other occupied by unruly bands of impudent hecklers and discourteous objectors.” The Budget Presentation was a theater of the absurd;one side of the opera occupied by the oleaginous & obsequious choristers craving for the attention of Mr Prez,cheering even a sip of water;And the other occupied by unruly bands of impudent hecklers & discourteous objectors. — Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) December 19, 2018  DSS, police takeover N/Assembly as Buhari presents budget today PDP MPs disrupt Buhari’s budget presentation Buhari stands for 69 minutes to deliver speech
