The founder/Principal Partner of Nextier Advisory, Mr. Patrick Okigbo, has said that electricity tariffs in the country need to be urgently reviewed to save the sector. Okigbo said this at the opening of a two-day workshop in Abuja organised by the firm to educate political parties on the issues affecting the power and petroleum sectors ahead of the 2019 general elections. “Some of the problem is tied to the fact that the tariffs are very low. Why are the tariffs low? Because we have not achieved cost reflectivity in the tariff,” he said. Okigbo said politics was at the centre of the huge tariff gap in the sector because those in government think Nigerians will react negatively if electricity tariff is increased. He noted however that the people will only complain because they have not been communicated rightly on the need for a cost reflective tariff. “Or maybe we have not achieved increased supply so that Nigerians would see that there is a bit of an improvement so that if you tell them to pay more, they will pay… people need to pay the right tariff,” he added.
