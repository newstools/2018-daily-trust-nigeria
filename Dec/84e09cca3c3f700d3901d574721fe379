The pioneer chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Gombe State, Alhaji Adamu Yaro Gombe, has announced his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Addressing newsmen after meeting with his supporters, AY Gombe, as he is popularly known, said he and over 10,000 loyalists under the AY Support Group across the 11 LGAs of the state decided to ditch the PDP “over the grave injustice meted to our members especially after the just concluded PDP primary elections.” AY Gombe, a one-time member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the PDP, said they decided to leave the PDP because of what he described as bad treatment by the party leadership both at the state and national levels. According to him, he was not accorded the respect he deserved by the party leaders and stakeholders as the pioneer chairman of the PDP in the state. “I informed Governor Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo of the unfortunate situation and my decision to leave the party about six months ago, but he is yet to respond to me which I take as a go ahead for me and my supporters to leave the party,” he said. The ex-PDP stalwart added that they chose APC because of the performance of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration in the last three years. Our correspondent’s efforts to get the response of the state PDP proved abortive, as the secretary of the state chapter of the party did not answer calls to his phone. Also, at the time of filing this report he did not reply a text message sent to him.
