The Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, yesterday, evaded a question about his planned defection to another political party over the inability of the APC to field candidates for governorship, national and state assemblies in the state. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had banned APC from fielding candidates for governorship, national and state assemblies in Zamfara State over the inability of the party to organise primaries or reach consensus in the state. Gov. Yari was in the Presidential Villa yesterday where he met the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, together with the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, and the Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima. Yari, Gov. Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State and Rochas Okorocha of Imo State had since clashed with the National Chairman of the APC, Com. Adams Oshiomhole, over the just concluded primaries of the party. Asked whether he and his anointed candidate, Mukhtar Shehu Idris, would dump APC, Gov. Yari simply said, “If you want to discuss politics, you can go to party secretariat.” He said they met with the vice president over the forthcoming National Economic Council (NEC) meeting slated for December 14.
