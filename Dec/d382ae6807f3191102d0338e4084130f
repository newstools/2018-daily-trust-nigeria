Iran’s ambassador to Tirana and another diplomat have been thrown out of Albania for “threatening the security of the country,” officials say. Precise reasons for the expulsion were not given. However, US officials praised the decision and said it sent a clear message that conducting “terrorist operations in Europe” was unacceptable. Iran blamed Israel and the US for putting pressure on Albania, adding it had respected Albanian laws. “This unjustifiable behaviour of the Albanian government… is completely based on false and fabricated intelligence and is unacceptable and condemned,” said the foreign ministry in Tehran. The ambassador’s name was not given but was widely reported to be Gholamhossein Mohammadnia. The foreign ministry said the decision to expel the two diplomats had been taken with “ally countries” because of the pair’s “activities in violation of their diplomatic status”.
