Akwa Ibom State Governor Udoh Emmanuel explained yesterday that he gave the permission for the use of the Nest of Champions Stadium in Uyo for the flag-off of President Muhammadu Buhari’s south-south campaign because of his respect for the Office of the President. The governor, in a statement by the director-general of his campaign organisation, Idongesit Nkanga, said the decision was not a sign of weakness, but a display of his leadership maturity. He said the decision was taken to foster peace in the state. “The decision of the Akwa Ibom State government to grant the use of the Nest of Champions stadium for the APC presidential campaign flag-off after an initial concerns over the potential damage to the facility and the humongous repair cost the state government will incur after the event is a clear indication that the governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, respects constitutional offices, especially the office of the President. “It is also worthy to note that the decision is a clear indication of the huge sense of maturity and exemplary statesmanship by the governor. This action is more profane if you consider that some of the key protagonists of APC today while in power, had several times displayed a clear lack of tact and class.
