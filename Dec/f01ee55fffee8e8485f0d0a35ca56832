Following yesterday’s judgement of the Court of Appeal in Ibadan which sets aside the order recognizing him and his loyalists as PDP candidates in Ogun State, Senator Buruji Kashamu says he will challenge the judgement in the Supreme Court. His counsel, Mrs. Ifeoma Esom, who stated this after the judgement argued that the decision of the Appeal Court did not in any way affect Kashamu’s candidacy. She said “This judgment does not affect the candidature of Kashamu as the Ogun PDP governorship candidate. His candidature is predicated on the judgement of Justice I .N Buba of the Lagos Division of the Federal High Court. That judgement is still subsisting and there is no appeal whatsoever against that judgment,” she said. The Appeal Court, Ibadan Division had yesterday set aside the order granted by a Federal High Court in Abeokuta, directing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to accept and process the list of Ogun PDP candidates submitted to it by the Chief Adebayo Dayo-led faction of the party for 2019 the elections. In a unanimous decision by the three-member Appeal Panel headed by Justice J. A Bada, the court held that the order and all decisions arising from the October 2 ruling by Justice Abubakar Shittu were a nullity because PDP and other defendants were not served the court processes culminating in the orders. Justice H. S Tsamani, in a lead judgment, said service was a fundamental requirement and a condition precedent in any adjudication, stressing that any proceeding and order made on a matter where the defendants were not served would remain a nullity.
