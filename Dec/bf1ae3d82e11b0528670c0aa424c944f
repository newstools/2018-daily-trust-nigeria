The chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN), Southern Kaduna, Abdulhamid Musa Albarka, has disclosed a plan to set up a committee comprising farmers and herdsmen in the area to promote peaceful coexistence. Speaking weekend at a meeting with youth leaders and local government chairmen of the association of the eight local government areas in Kafanchan, Albarka urged his members to notify community leaders of their intention to cross their land during migration and obey constituted authorities to avoid any clash between them and farmers. He also called on the state government and the Federal Governments to include herders in their planned disbursement of funds to the victims of 2011 post-election violence.
