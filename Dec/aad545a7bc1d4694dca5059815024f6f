A chieftain of the All progressives Congress (APC) in Danko-Wasagu area of Kebbi State, Alhaji Dan Musa Ribah has moved to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with his supporters. The Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party in Kebbi, Alhaji Haruna Saidu stated this in Ribah, Danko Wasagu local government area of Kebbi State at the weekend when receiving the decampees at a rally in Ribah area of the state. He said Alhaji Dan Musa could not attend the ceremony organized for him and his followers in Ribah because he was taken away by unknown persons. Saidu explained that prior to the defection ceremony, the ex speaker informed him that he decided to leave the APC because the party was not fair to him during his trying time. He said: “We are here in Ribah because he gave me his words that he had left APC for the PDP. He has directed his supporters and community people to move to the PDP and we are receiving them today”. The PDP governorship candidate, Senator Isah Galaudu assured the defectors of equal treatment in the party.
