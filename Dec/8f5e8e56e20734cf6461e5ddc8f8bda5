The governorship candidate of the APC in Akwa Ibom State, Nsima Ekere, has said the PDP will lose 2019 elections since it has lost 90 per cent of personalities that make things happen to his party. Ekere, who is the Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), said this in Abuja while fielding questions from journalists. He said the APC had been transformed into an election-winning machine poised to crush all opposition during the coming elections. He said the APC had emerged stronger after the governorship primary in the state, stressing that all aspirants that slugged it out with him had united behind him. When asked to explain the reasons why the PDP would not retain power in Akwa Ibom State, Ekere said, “Do I need to tell you that there is no way PDP can will in Akwa Ibom? They don’t even have the men and resources. That is why you are having defection on a daily basis in the state to join the APC. Even government officials are resigning from the government and the party to join us in the APC. Do I still need to tell you that we will win?” PDP can't win again Akwa Ibom - APC gov'ship candidate Udoedehe throws weight behind  Ekere in A/Ibom Nsima Ekere and the Akwa-Ibom governorship race
