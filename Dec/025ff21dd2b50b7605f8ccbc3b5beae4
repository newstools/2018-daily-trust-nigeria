The Nigerian Guild of Editors says the media is concentrating much on political bickering and campaign of calumny by politicians instead of focusing on issues. The guild released a communique after its standing committee met in Bauchi, noting that a growing trend of dwelling on inanities and calumny in reportage by the Nigerian media instead of issues will not give Nigerians a clear choice of candidates in the elections. The NGE therefore enjoins the media to pay more attention to politicians who campaign on issues and shun the other who indulge in smear campaigns against their opponents or political parties. It also called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct free, fair and credible elections and remember that its loyalty is to the nation not to any political party or candidate. The Guild also lamented the growing trend of vote-buying and reminds the electorate not to mortgage their future for pecuniary gains. It reminds politicians that election is not a do- or-die affair as the survival of the country is of paramount importance to all.
