The National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANT) has commended the Federal Government for the successes recorded so far in the formulation and implementation of agricultural policies. The president of the association, Mr. Ken Ukaoha, made the commendation in Abuja at the joint sector review (JSR) of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) stakeholders’ advocacy meeting. He, however, urged the government to increase funding and strengthen the monitoring mechanisms of the policies to create the much-needed impact on the populace. He said though policies were already developed to increase agricultural performance, the monitoring of the impact of the policies on the people had not been effective. He said, “The agric trade agreement did not link with the continental level before but now the Federal Government has ensured that the country has strong linkage with continental and the Economic Community of West Africa State (ECOWAS) levels.” Diversification: Experts call for synergy of Agric policies Farmers advocate inclusion in policy making Don leads food security coalition to agric show
