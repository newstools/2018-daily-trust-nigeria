A female candidate vying for a seat in the Kaduna State House of Assembly under the APC platform, Mrs. Maureen Yayock Lekwot has organised a novelty football tournament to promote peaceful election in the area. Mrs Lekwot, in an interview with newsmen, during the kick off of the tournament held at the Samaru Kataf football pitch in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area said the aim was to demonstrate that the people could accommodate each other irrespective of their affiliations. “Just as football is a rallying point for especially young people irrespective of their beliefs and inclinations, it is hoped that the people would approach politics with the same spirit. “We want to use avenues like this to sensitise the community to shun acts capable of causing disharmony during the general election by demonstrating that peaceful coexistence was the best antidote to violence,” she said. The candidate said it was high time the people realised that there was no party in the state that was associated with a particular religion or tribe, adding that people should  only vote for candidates who would protect their interest. Earlier in a remark Mr Ishaku Shakarau an APC stalwart said there was need to instill in the mind of the people the need to insist on good governance. “The message of peaceful coexistence cannot be over emphasized as it was the bedrock of development of any society,” he said. Arewa Trust reports that eight communities – Zonzon, Magamia, Zaman Dabo, Jankasa, Ikulu, Ungwan Gaya, Gora and Zango Urban participated in the tournament. 2019: APC committed to peaceful elections in Kaduna State – El-Rufai LG election: Kaduna legislator warns constituents against violence Osun poll: Our victory is incontestable, says APC
