A Grade I Area Court, Karu, FCT, yesterday sentenced a  scavenger,  Yusuf Samaila, to two months in prison for stealing a car seat. The judge, Sani Mohammed, however,  gave Samaila, 19, who lives in Nyanya Pantaker, an option to pay a fine of N5, 000. Mohammed held that the court was lenient with the convict because he was a first time offender. He warned him to desist from committing crime. The convict, who had pleaded guilty to the charges, urged the court to temper justice with mercy, saying the hard times were responsible for the crime he committed. The prosecutor, Vincent Osuji, had told the court that one Abdullahi Sani of Kugbo Mechanic village, Abuja, reported the matter at Karu Police Station, Abuja on Nov. 15. Osuji said the complainant alleged that the convict stole his car seat from where he parked his car. He also informed the court that during police investigation, the convict confessed to committing the crime and the stolen item was recovered from him. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 287 of the Penal Code.
