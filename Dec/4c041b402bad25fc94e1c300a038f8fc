A former Kaduna State Governor, Alhaji Balarabe Musa has described the controversy between President Muhammadu Buhari and his Wife Aisha Buhari over cabal claims as ‘unislamic’. The elder statesman lamented that Nigerians didn’t expect such a behavior from both the president and his wife in public. He explained that as husband and wife, there were certain things that should be kept away from public views. “It’s unislamic the allegations from the both sides, here I mean the allegations of the wife and the response of the president because we don’t expect these kinds of things happening between wife and the husband. “In an Islamic society, there are certain things that should be kept away from public views. “So it’s very unfortunate and I think people should not be involved in this controversy. I dismissed it as unislamic and not in culture of Islam because you don’t expect this to happen between leaders, husbands and wives even between friends,” he said.
