The National Vice Chairman, South-South of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ntufam Hilliard Etta, has cautioned the minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Pastor Usani Uguru Usani from parading himself as the governorship candidate of the party in Cross River state for the 2019 general election. He extended the same warning to all others equally parading themselves as candidates for other elective positions, emphasising that only the candidates duly endorsed by the national headquarters of the party were those to stand for election. Eta spoke in Calabar when the governorship candidate of the party, Senator John Owan-Enoh, commissioned his campaign office which is adjacent the state’s party secretariat. He stressed that if they did not desist from the act of impersonation, the party would invoke relevant sections of the party’s constitution against them and hand them over to the law enforcement agencies. He informed that the national reconciliation committee set up by the party would soon arrive the state in order for all aggrieved party members to resolve their problems. “There is impersonation across board. This must be resisted. We are going to take it up with the law enforcement agencies. “However, the reconciliation committee will be here in Cross River; so, those who are aggrieved should avail themselves of the opportunity to air their grievances,” he said. He alleged that it was the PDP who were attempting to bring confusion into APC in the state, calling on all to unite in order for the party to have a common front to defeat the ruling PDP. Also speaking, former Senate majority leader, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba regretted that the state has so much during the government of the PDP since 1999, assuring that APC was unstoppable at recovering the state.
