The Akwa Ibom State governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, has received over 20,000 APC members who defected to the PDP. Emmanuel, who challenged the APC in the state to a debate to determine which of the political parties had a sustainable plan for the development of the state, said he was not moved by the “ranting” of the opposition, describing their members as  “empty vessels.” Addressing a jubilant crowd that sang and danced, displaying a mock coffin with the inscription ‘APC RIP’, the governor described leaders of the APC as “looters who have no sustainable plan for the empowerment of the people and the overall development of the state.” He commended the defectors for taking a worthwhile decision to join the PDP, adding that the party was the only grassroots party in the country. “Today it is a thing of joy that over 20,000 of just one group have come…This is unprecedented in the history of our state. What you are doing today is not about me, it is not about the party chairman, or any other person, it is about the soul of Akwa Ibom State,” Governor Emmanuel said.
