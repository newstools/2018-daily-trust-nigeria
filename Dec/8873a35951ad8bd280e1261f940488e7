The gubernatorial candidate of Accord Party in Katsina state, Shehu Rimi, said his administration shall focus on five key areas that are novel, innovative and geared towards the poor, if elected in the 2019 poll. Speaking at the unveiling of his programmes, ahead of the general election, Rimi said the areas are based on having a peoples-oriented government and enhanced economic policies. Others are human and infrastructural development, quality and rightful education, security and women development. If elected, he said, a much improved ministry of Family Affairs will be created to give room for holistic and comprehensive women’s health, children concerns and other necessary aspects that are essential to the general well-being of the society as the family is the smallest unit in the society. “My government will have the leanest structure with only 6 commissioners and special advisers as members of cabinet. The civil service will be strengthened and be made very professional,” he said. He said Katsina is in dire need for a better alternative government saying that presently it has been reduced to the most backward in the comity of states in the country.
