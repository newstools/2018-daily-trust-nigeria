The District Head of Ketare, in Kankar Local Government Area, Alhaji Usman Bello Kankara, has called on people in his domain to desist from the habit of open defecation and  imbibe the culture of personal and environmental hygiene. Speaking at his palace in Ketere during the inauguration of environmental sanitation and open defecation control committee, Bello said the committee was in line with the directives of  emir of Katsina Alhaji Abdulmumini Kabir Usman to all district heads to set up the committees to check the habit of open defecation and improve on personal and environmental hygiene. He said, all village and ward heads were expected to set up a similar committee in their domain  for wider coverage and effective implementation of the open defecation policy at all levels across the district. According to him, efforts of  village and ward heads must be enhanced with an enlightenment on the dangers of open defecation and supervision to ensure compliance. “UNICEF in collaboration with Katsina State government is constructing hand pumps to improve access to clean water to every community that is certified open defecation free.” “I call on households to ensure they have a proper pit latrine and ensure it is always closed. People should inculcate the habit of hand washing after using the toilet as well as before and after eating,” he said. Kanwa said as part of ensuring effective implementation, unscheduled visits shall be carried out to ensure proper monitoring and compliance across his domain.   ‘How being open defecation free zone helped us’ AMAC moves against open defecation How WaterAid got water to communities in Jigawa
