The Northern Traditional Rulers’ Council has raised the alarm that the security challenges in the country may seriously affect the conduct of the 2019 general elections. The council urged the Federal Government and the security agencies to tackle the security challenges, saying the situation was rising to a catastrophic level. “The rising wave of kidnapping and banditry, rising farmers-herders’ conflicts, resurgence of insurgency and other forms of criminalities that may seriously affect the conduct of the 2019 elections,” the council stated in a communique issued at the end of its 5th General Assembly, signed by its coordinating committee’s chairman and Emir of Gummi Justice Lawal Hassan. The council which identified unavailability of adequate grazing reserves and livestock routes as a major underlining cause of the incessant farmers- herders conflict, called for the provision of grazing reserves and livestock routes that should be gazetted and protected. While acknowledging goverrnmrnt‘s successful efforts in the return of some Internally Displaced Persons to their homes, it however expressed concern over the difficulties faced by the remaining IDPs in camps. It noted with deep concern the continued use of religious and ethnic prejudices in politics and reminded politicians that ”a democratic society cannot be established through violence, injustice and impunity.” The council urged the politicians to eschew all forms of divisive tendencies and work with security agencies to expose people involved in such nefarious activities. It described use of innocent youths as political thugs as very sad and unfortunate, urging parents to be more proactive in instilling good morals in their children. It condemned the rising level of hate speech, bickering, do-or-die political campaigns, vote-buying and money politics and urged politicians to immediately change their tactics to those of honour and decorum in order to avoid the consequences of such act.
