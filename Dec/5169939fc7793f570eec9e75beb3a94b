The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has commenced the review of its customer Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the resolution of consumer complaints and escalations to service providers. This measure is designed to ensure faster and more effective resolution of consumer complaints in the telecoms industry and improve overall consumer experience on all telecoms networks, the NCC disclosed yesterday. The review will be carried out by a joint NCC-Industry Working Committee which the Commission has set up so as to ensure robust Stakeholder participation in the exercise, and in furtherance of its consultative approach to rule-making. Speaking during the inauguration of the NCC component of Working Committee, at the Commission’s headquarters in Abuja, Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management (ECSM) of NCC, Mr. Sunday Dare, reemphasized the Commission’s uncompromising commitment to ensuring superior consumer experience on all telecoms platforms. He noted that the NCC believes that effective and timely resolution of consumer complaints as fundamental elements of consumer protection. He therefore charged the Committee to ensure that reviewed SLAs entrench the Commission’s consumer-centric focus, whilst also taking due cognizance of the relevant ecosystem, technology and other factors affecting QoS. Recall that NCC had met with service providers and Association of Licensed Telecom Operators of Nigeria [ALTON], the umbrella industry organisation in Lagos on in September to discuss ways of enhancing the speed and quality of complaints resolution. At that meeting, the Commission had expressed its strong displeasure about delays in complaints resolution, while operators pointed to the need to review some of the SLAs to reflect developments in technology and other factors impacting performance.
