The Chairman of Action Alliance (AA) in Imo State, Chief Anthony Uchendu Ahaneku, has said Uche Nwosu is the authentic and recognised candidate of the party for the 2019 governorship election in the state. Ahaneku, speaking at the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) secretariat in Owerri on Wednesday, said that Nwosu had fulfilled all the requirements to become the party’s flagbearer. He dismissed the claims of Mr. Leonard Okolienta, who said he is the governorship candidate of the party in Imo, describing him as an impostor who neither purchased the party’s nomination forms nor paid all the necessary fees. He challenged Okolienta to produce the receipt of the fees he paid. Ahaneku said, “Okolienta is not our candidate and is not worthy to be our candidate. He tried to come into the party through the back door and he is not known to us because he did not pay for expression of interest and nomination forms. “He did not meet the criteria to contest and when the party made the decision to have a candidate, Uche Nwosu fitted the bill. Nwosu will follow our ideals and reforms.  He is the one we are looking for to deliver on our mandates in Imo and we call on all Imo people to support him.” Nwosu to vie for Imo gov’ship in Alliance party My son in-law will contest Imo gov’ship in another party – Okorocha I remain Imo APC governorship candidate, Nwosu insists
