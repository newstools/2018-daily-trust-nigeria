The Presidential candidate of the National Interest Party (NIP), Eunice Uche Atuejide, said yesterday that she will sue President Muhammadu Buhari over his alleged health challenge. Mrs. Atuejide who is also the national chairman of the party, said  joined in the suit would be President Buhari’s doctors, his Chief of Staff, the ruling APC, First Lady Hajiya Aisha, and INEC. She said, “It takes a lot of work and financial resources to keep a man so physically and mentally challenged at the presidency; but to plan to impose him on this country for four more years is taking things a little too far,” she said. 7 months to elections: Number of presidential aspirants hits 46 2019’s most unexpected candidates Atiku signs 2019 peace deal, asks Buhari to sign electoral bill
