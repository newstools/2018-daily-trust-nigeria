The rail sector in African needs an annual investment of about $20 billion to bring it to the required level. This was the take of the President of the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), Prof. Benedict Oramah, while signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Russian Railways and the Russian Export Centre (REC) in Moscow. The MoU was an agreement between Afreximbank and the two other parties to cooperate in implementing export and investment projects in the railway sector in Africa. Under the terms of the MoU, the parties will cooperate by undertaking mutual consultations on export and investment projects in the railway sector abroad and by jointly developing project financing schemes in the sector. Prof. Oramah signed the document on behalf of the bank while Oleg Belozyorov, Director General of Russian Railways, and Andrey Slepnev, Director General of REC, signed for their respective organisations. Speaking after the signing, Prof. Oramah cited the huge demand for infrastructure in Africa and said the continent needed huge investments in the rail sector. He said Afreximbankâ€™s role was to find partners that would help it to deliver the necessary investment in Africa. The signing of the MoU would enable Russia to begin to participate in the opportunities that exist in Africa, he added. Mr. Slepnev described the signing of the MoU as a demonstration of practical collaboration among the institutions and expressed confidence that it would bear fruits.
