The chairman of Kuje Area Council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has expressed worry over increased cases of kidnapping and other crimes in the area. Galadima stated this while speaking with newsmen after a closed door security meeting which had traditional rulers and representatives of various security agencies in attendance in his office on Wednesday. He stressed that there was need for collective efforts by every individual by reporting promptly to security agencies wherever there was security threat. He said it was the increase in cases of kidnapping, armed robbery and other crimes in the area that prompted the council to summon the emergency security meeting. According to him, the security meeting would work out modalities on how to ensure that the entire residents have a hitch-free Christmas celebration in the area. “It is quite worrisome that the rate of kidnapping and armed robbery has increased. We are aware that at the end of the year like this, there are security challenges, but we are not relenting,” he said. The chairman, therefore, assured residents of the council on the protection of their lives and property, saying the council had engaged spiritual fathers and other clerics to continue to pray to overcome the security challenges facing the council. He added that security agents had put in place strategies to protect the lives of every individual in the area, and called on residents, especially youth, to remain law abiding to constituted authorities in the area. 8 deadly security threats Nigeria is facing ‘To check kidnapping, Governor Akpabio has acquired 11 gunboats Police arrest 20 suspected cult members in Akwa Ibom
