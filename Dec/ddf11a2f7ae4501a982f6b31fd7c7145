The Kano State Government yesterday began payment of N2 billion to 1,313 pensioners as their arrears and gratuities. Governor Abdullahi Ganduje said the payment covered the period of November 2015 to June 2016. Ganduje, represented by his deputy, Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, noted that the administration, from inception, had paid over N36bn pensions. He said a technical committee on pension had been inaugurated to improve the 2006 Pension Law and look into the possibility of amending the relevant sections of the law to strengthen the Pension Fund and insulate it from the executive arbitrariness. “I will like to use this medium to draw the attention of the Kano State Judiciary, particularly Shari’a Court in the State as a matter of urgency, to disburse all monies to the heirs of deceased civil servants immediately after the payment”, he urged.
