Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, has retracted his earlier story of speaking with the widow of Lt. Col Ibrahim Sakaba, killed by Boko Haram at Metele last month. He now said he spoke with the slain soldier’s sister, Maryam. The PDP candidate had opened himself to widespread derision following his online post that he spoke with Seun, Sakaba’s wife. But the woman denied she received a phone call from Abubakar and wondered why the 72 year-old politician lied.

The error is regretted. “Atiku Abubakar, however reaffirms his deepest condolences to the Sakaba family, which sacrifices, like those of their brave son, keeps us safe”.
