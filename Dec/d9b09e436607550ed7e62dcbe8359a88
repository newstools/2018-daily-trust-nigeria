A forum of presidential candidates has filed an action before a Federal High Court in Abuja seeking to stop President Muhammadu Buhari from assenting to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill presently before him. The suit is seeking a declaration from the court that the president’s assent to the law “will truncate the 2019 general elections.” The originating summons was yesterday brought by the Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance (APDA), Allied Peoples Movement (APM) and the Movement for Restoration and Defence of Democracy (MRDD) through their counsel, Adekunle Otitoju. Those joined as defendants are the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of INEC and the Attorney General of the Federation. In an averment in the affidavit by Shittu Mohammed Kabir, the chairman of the forum and presidential candidate of APDA, he told the court that, “I know as a fact that changing or amending the act that has been used for primary elections in preparation for the forthcoming general elections, which is less than three months away, will engender confusion in the electoral/political process.” He continued, “I know as a fact that that there is no way the electorates (sic) who are not educated in this area can assimilate the act of electoral voting and transmission in less than two months to the general elections,” he averred. No date was fixed for the hearing.
