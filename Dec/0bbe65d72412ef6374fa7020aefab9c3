The Niger State House of Assembly yesterday increased the 2019 budget estimate by over N4 billion, thereby bringing the total figure to N164.45 billion. The chairman of the House Committee on Appropriation and Planning, Muhammad Lokogoma, said adjustments were made in areas considered critical with a belief that more revenues would be sourced to finance them. The speaker of the House, Ahmed Marafa, directed the clerk to forward copies of the budget to the governor for his assent.
