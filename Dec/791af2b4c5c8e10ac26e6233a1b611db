Akwa Ibom state governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, has approved the use of Godswill Akpabio International Stadium for the flag-off of President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election campaign in the South-South region. A statement signed by the Commissioner for Youths and Sport, Mr Monday Uko, on Monday night said the approval follows the decision of managers of the stadium, Julius Berger Plc, to recall its staff to work on the stadium before the commencement of Akwa United match billed to be played there.
