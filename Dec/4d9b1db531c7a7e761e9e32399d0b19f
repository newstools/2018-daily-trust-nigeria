The Executive Secretary of the National Sugar Development Council, Latif Busari, says Nigeria needs about 250,000 hectares of land for sugarcane cultivation and 28 factories of varying capacities to become self-sufficient in food and industrial demand for sugar. Busari disclosed this in Benin weekend during the National Sugar Development Council (NSDC)â€™s Southern Region Sugar Sensitisation Workshop. He said Nigeria had the potential of becoming a net exporter of sugar if the capacity of the existing sugar plants was enhanced; and new plants established and sugarcane out-grower farmers supported through the provision of credit facilities and basic infrastructure. Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki said the state government would drive the development of oil palm sector in the state using the sugar industry model.
