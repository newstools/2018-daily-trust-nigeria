The consistent criticisms of President Muhammadu Buhari by former president Olusegun Obasanjo is indecorous, undignified, and therefore in bad taste, the senator representing Nasarawa West Senatorial District, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has said. Adamu was reacting to Sunday’s statement by Obasanjo to the effect that he would not stand on the fence in the 2019 general elections, accusing the Buhari-led government of nepotism, incompetence and brazen impunity. The former president had said in a statement by his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, that “only a fool will sit on the fence or be neutral when his or her country is being destroyed with incompetence, corruption, lack of focus, insecurity, nepotism, brazen impunity and denial of the obvious.” But Sen. Adamu, who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, said in Abuja, yesterday, that although Obasanjo had the right to criticise the president, he should not be pedestrian in doing so. He said it appeared Obasanjo was pushing his luck too far with his consistent attacks on President Buhari, saying the former president needed to learn some form of decorum from some past Nigerian leaders. “Chief Obasanjo is pushing his luck too far by using indecorous language in criticising the president. After all, what was his record in office when he ran this country first from February, 1976 to October 1979, and subsequently from May, 1999 to May 2007?” he asked.
