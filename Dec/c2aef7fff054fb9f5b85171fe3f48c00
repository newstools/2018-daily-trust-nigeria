China’s ex-intelligence chief Ma Jian has been sentenced to life in prison for crimes including taking bribes and insider trading, a court says. Ma had been put under investigation in 2015 and expelled from the Communist Party one year later. He pleaded guilty and would not appeal, a court in the north-eastern Liaoning province said. Many high-ranking officials have been toppled as part of President Xi Jinping’s vast anti-corruption drive. Ma Jian was vice-minister in the powerful ministry of state security, which oversees foreign and counterintelligence operations. His case is linked to that of one of China’s most-wanted fugitives, exiled property tycoon Guo Wengui, who has published a series of allegations of corruption among top members of the Communist Party. Ma used his position to help Guo Wengui, who now lives in New York, further his business interests, the Dalian Intermediate People’s Court said in a statement.
