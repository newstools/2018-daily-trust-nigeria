The alert level for Indonesia’s Anak Krakatau volcano has been raised to the second-highest level possible, after a series of eruptions. All flights around the volcano have been rerouted and a 5km (three-mile) exclusion zone has also been imposed. Indonesia’s disaster management agency (BNPB) said the alert level had been raised from level two to three because of the increased volcanic activity.  Last Saturday, the volcano triggered a tsunami which killed hundreds. “The volcanic activity of Anak Krakatau continues to increase,” said BNPB in a press statement, citing data from the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia. “The danger zone [has been] extended from 2km to 5km… people and tourists are prohibited from carrying out activities within a 5km radius.”  INDONESIA: Tsunami death toll rises to 373 Nearly 50,000 people flee rumbling Bali volcano Indonesia''s Mount Barujari erupts
