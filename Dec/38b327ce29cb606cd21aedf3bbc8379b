The Northern Youth Leaders Forum (NYLF) has withdrawn its support for the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and thrown its weight behind President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term bid ahead of the 2019 general elections. NYLF National Chairman, Elliot Afiyo, made this known in an interview with some journalists, shortly after a youth sensitisation programme held in Ibafo, Ogun State. Afiyo said the group rescinded its earlier decision to back the former vice president against the incumbent president because it was disappointed by the policy document of the PDP presidential flag bearer. He explained that Atiku ignored the group’s warning that his running mate should be picked from the South-South instead of the South-East. Afiyo equally said Atiku had “failed to tell and convince Nigerians what he would do differently if elected as president in 2019 during his regional campaigns.” 2019: Peter Obi's choice, a political suicide, NYLF tells Atiku I’ve forgiven Atiku, others —Obasanjo 2019: Why Atiku is our preferred choice - Igbo youths
