A statement from Afreximbank said Heirs Holdings, which has significant investments across Africa in the financial services, resources, real estate and hospitality and power sectors, plans to deploy the facilities to further support its power, oil and gas strategy, as it positions itself as an African leader in integrated natural resources. Afreximbank president, Prof. Benedict Oramah, represented the bank while Tony Elumelu, chairman of Heirs Holdings, represented the group during the signing ceremony at the inaugural Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF) in Cairo.

Together, we illustrate that Africa can create world class institutions, which are capable of successfully making the long-term investments necessary for Africa’s economic transformation,”he added. The IATF, organized by Afreximbank, in collaboration with the African Union, and hosted by the Government of Egypt, will last until 17 December 2018 and is expected to attract about 70,000 visitors.
