Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele has said states can be viable if they focus on their areas of strength and develop them to increase their revenue instead of depending on dwindling oil revenue. “I do not think states can’t be viable. They were self-sustaining in the days of regions. I don’t like states coming to Abuja with pan in hand. “We’ve abandoned agriculture. Everybody is now depending on oil. States can be viable if they leverage their advantage,” Emefiele said. He spoke on Monday evening when he received Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola in his office, according to his Chief Press Secretary, Adeniyi Adesina. Oyetola was at the CBN to request support for his programmes especially in the areas of agriculture, youth entrepreneurship and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). He was accompanied by some officials superintending as administrators of ministries – Dr. Charles Akindiji Akinola, Mr. Bola Oyebamiji, Mr. Remi Omowaiye, a member of the House of Representatives Israel Ajibola and Chief Press Secretary Adeniyi Adesina. The governor told the CBN boss that the state was ready with programmes that will generate jobs in agriculture and mining  and requested for support in form of loans for small scale entrepreneurs and farmers. He said his government plans to hold an economic summit within the first quarter of next year to address its development and to make progress in job creation, adding that the summit will also address the plan to raise revenue. Besides, there is a plan to establish nine farm centres in the nine federal constituencies, Oyetola added. Emefiele promised to support the state within the ambit of the CBN programmes, adding that he had known the governor for many years as a man of integrity and competence when he was a private sector player.
