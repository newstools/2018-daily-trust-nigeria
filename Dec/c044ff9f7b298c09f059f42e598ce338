The family of late former Vice President, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, has extolled the virtues of the first executive President of the country, Alhaji Shehu Shagari who died on Friday. Ekwueme who died on November 19, 2017 was the Vice President to Shagari during the second republic. Ekwueme’s first son, Apostle Goodheart Obi, in a statement on behalf of the family and the entire people of Oko in Anambra State, described Shagari as an example of moral leadership. The family described late Shagari as an epitome of high moral leadership, having meritoriously served Nigeria without blemish, a virtue he evidently shared with his late Vice, Dr Ekwueme. The Ekwueme family noted that Shagari had the most cordial working relationship with his Vice President and both had greater hearts of service for the nation. “They were more nationalistic in their work relation and even though they both had different religious backgrounds, they were not polarized by the issues of religion and tribe. They were first and foremost Nigerians before Christians or Muslims, Fulani or Igbo. They were both selfless,” the family said. The family recalled that Shagari again demonstrated his humility in his message through his son, Aminu Shagari, at Ekwueme’s burial, where he said he chose him as his Vice President because of his impeccable integrity and character.
