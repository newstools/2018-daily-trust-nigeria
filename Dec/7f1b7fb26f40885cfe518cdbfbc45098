Jumali Teen Summer Leadership Training Academy has trained over 50 students of the Air Force Girls Comprehensive School, Abuja on leadership skills. The director of the academy, Mrs Ezeiruaku O Ada, said the training was aimed at bringing out leadership qualities in teenagers and preparing them for leadership roles in the future. She urged students to be serious about their goals, adding that they should be attentive and use all they were taught during the training to better their lives. The academyâ€™s human resource officer, Hadiza Kubura, said many teenagers were good in their studies but few exhibited leadership skills. Kubura said at the end of the two-day programme, the teenagers would have been confident to talk in the public apart from gaining valuable leadership skills. One of the beneficiaries, Awomodu Motunrayo Jemima, a JSS 3 student, commended the organisers for the programme, adding that she was better prepared to take up leadership roles in the future.
