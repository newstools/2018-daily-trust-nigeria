The Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Abuja chapter, has sworn Tpl. Garba Jibril, as its new chairman. The new chairman expressed concern that over 90 per cent of the cities in Nigeria lack proper master plans and most of them were developed without any such plan. He said state governments do not abide by the provisions of the urban regional planning law, a development that resulted in unplanned state capitals and said it was a challenge to town planners across the country and encouraged state governments to obey the urban planning laws. “The challenge we have is that in other cities outside Abuja, in fact, in the whole of Nigeria, we have less than 10 per cent of Nigerian cities that have master plan. They lack proper guidance for the implementation of physical planning development. “We have less than 10 per cent of them that have a master plan and that is a major challenge for us. Most of the state capitals don’t abide by the provisions of the Urban Regional Planning Law. They give no regard to this law and this is unfortunate.” He added, “Most of the politicians in these states have no regard for that law. They don’t involve planners in the development of their states. So also the followers; people just buy land and start developing it without following due process and this is why we have challenges such as flooding.” NITP FCT elects new chairman National conference minus Nigerian town planners Dealing with Abuja congestion
