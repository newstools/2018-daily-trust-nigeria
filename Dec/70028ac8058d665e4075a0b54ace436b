The Development Bank of Nigeria  (DBN) is suited to finance the real sectors of the economy, a Professor of Finance and Capital Market at Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Prof. Uche Uwaleke, has said. He said “since commercial banks are profit oriented and the real sectors which are growth drivers are highly risky,” DBN can fill in the gap. “The experience of many emerging economies, especially the Asian Tigers, illustrates the critical role of these specialised banks in funnelling credit to the real sector,” he noted. He said “at present, a few banks in Nigeria are performing these roles. These include Bank of Industry and Bank of Agriculture, but they are grossly undercapitalised. Their functions also overlap.” The Managing Director, DBN, Mr. Tony Okpanachi recently said the bank had signed on at least 35,000 Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)/end borrowers within its first full year of operation. He added that it translated to a 75 per cent increase over the 20,000 MSMEs projection earlier announced for the year, and that the development further underscored the significant progress the institution had made since it commenced formal lending activities in October 2017. The unit would begin operation with $35 million in start-up funding in 2019 seeking to provide 50 percent guarantees for all credit disbursed through DBN and the funding will be increased as the unit takes on more portfolios. DBN has also reached agreement with 19 participating finance institutions (PFIs) and has strong focus on development objectives such as job creation and poverty alleviation supported by a strong, confidence boosting world class governance structure which has clear reporting standards.
