The Akarigbo and paramount ruler of Remo land, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, has handed over a 25-year plan of the entire Remo land to the governorship candidate of Allied Peoples Movement (APM) in Ogun State, Abdulkabir Akinlade. The monarch gave the challenge during a courtesy visit by the gubernatorial hopeful to the palace  of the Akarigbo in Sagamu area of Ogun East. The monarch said Akinlade is the only governorship candidate that visited him when he was in seclusion ahead of his installation as the Akarigbo last year. He expressed optimism that he will win the election. The Akarigbo, however, implored the governorship candidate to ensure that local governments were allowed to function as stipulated in the constitution if elected into office. Earlier, Akinlade promised to work hand in gloves with the traditional institutions, stressing that he will take the traditional institutions with utmost priority if elected. He also added that his administration would not embark on any new project until it completes all ongoing ones across the state.
