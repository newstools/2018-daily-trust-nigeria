A former National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and member of the party’s Presidential Campaign Council, Prof. Wale Oladipo has assured the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku Abubakar of massive votes from the South West geo-political zone. Oladipo in a statement Friday, said Atiku was a trusted presidential material who had been tested during the reign of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo who is from the South West, as a reliable politician. Prof. Oladipo stated that the wealth of experience garnered during the period coupled with Waziri’s private sector experience would be an advantage in running an all inclusive, liberal and God fearing government after winning the 2019 elections. Prof. Oladipo however, urged the leaders and members of the National Working Committee (NWC), to ensure total reconciliation of aggrieved party members in the zone for total victory for the party. “I commend the good work of members of the NWC of our party in their efforts to making the party regain its lost glory and I will also want the Board of Trustees (BoT) and other prominent leaders of the party to ensure a total reconciliation in the zone and others in general in order for it to make a successful outing in 2019. “This has become necessary so that we can go into the 2019 election battle as a united front. Once this is done, victory is assured. We need total reconciliation and it should be now,” Prof. Oladipo said.
