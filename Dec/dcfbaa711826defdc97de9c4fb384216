US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have agreed to halt new trade tariffs for 90 days for talks, the US says. At a post-G20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January. China will buy a “very substantial” amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products, the US says. Meanwhile, Beijing says the two sides agreed to open up their markets. It was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since a trade war erupted earlier this year. The dispute broke out after Trump complained China was doing nothing to cut its large surplus in bilateral trade.
