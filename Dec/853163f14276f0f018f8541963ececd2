The Lagos State chapter of the APC has described the former Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Olawale Oluwo, as a mole who had been working for the PDP. The APC State Publicity Secretary, Joe Igbokwe in a statement yesterday attributed the former commissioner’s resignation and expression of support for the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Jimi Agbaje, to the  “vigilance of the party apparatus and leadership which put Oluwo on the watch and succeeded in checkmating his rabid opportunism.” Oluwo in his resignation letter had alluded to the controversial gubernatorial primary of the ruling APC in the state which produced Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu as the party’s flag bearer instead of his boss, Governor Akinwunmi  Ambode  who was seeking a second term ticket.
