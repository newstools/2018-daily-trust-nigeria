The former National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has dismissed reports suggesting that he plans to leave the party. Odigie-Oyegun, who fielded questions from journalists in Abuja on Wednesday, urged Nigerians to ignore such rumour. He said as an originator who was part and parcel of the opposition’s plan and process to present a national democratic choice that would be acceptable to all Nigerians, it would be difficult for him to contemplate such move. “Yes, the party has issues and difficulties that need to be sorted out. But you don’t run away. You give what you have to ensure that the cracks are patched. What is going on is fluidity. I’m in APC. I can’t quite envisage that,” he said. He also spoke about his attachment to President Muhammadu Buhari since the military period, saying Buhari still remained the best candidate for re-election in 2019. Odigie-Oyegun, who voiced sadness over the state of relative instability in the ruling party, however, expressed optimism in the ability of Peace and Reconciliation Committee to mend fences.
