The Nigerian Navy yesterday warned against any form of thuggery or hooliganism in Lagos and Ogun States during and after the Christmas and New Year celebration. Particularly, it warned military men to be of good behaviour and to stay away from crisis, insisting that anyone arrested for being involved in crime would be severely dealt with. It said military men are expected to respect the laws of the land and not to violate it. According to the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Naval Training Command, Rear Admiral Stanford Enoch, security of lives and property is every personnel’s business adding that as the year is coming to an end, it is a time to be careful, as it is both joyous and deadly period. Speaking at the third quarter route match held in Lagos, assured members of the public of their safety. Represented by the Chief Staff officer (CSO), Rear Admiral Chris Ezekobe, Enoch said the 10km route match was meant to test the physical and mental fitness of personnel. “As the training command, NAVTRAC is aware of the security challenges facing the country and would ensure training is tailored to address the problems, we train at the tactical level and most of the personnel you see here are going back to the field, if we get it right at the training level we will definitely get it right in the field and vice versa. They are foot soldiers, it behooves on them to be disciplined, and vigilant in the discharge of their duties as negative elements will want to use the armed forces and other security agencies to perpetrate evil during elections, the military is the only institution that holds our constitution together. Once we miss it, the very fabrics called Nigeria is gone”, he said He urged members of the armed forces to see themselves as partners in the building of this great country.
