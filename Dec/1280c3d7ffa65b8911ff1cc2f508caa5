The attention of the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has be drawn to the increasing influx of imported substandard batteries into the country by manufacturers and assemblers of automotive batteries in the country. Speaking during the presentation of MAN Conformity Assessment Programme (MAN CAP) certificate to his company in Ilorin, yesterday, the Managing Director of Forgo Battery Limited, Joseph Offorjama, called for urgent intervention of the regulating agency to rid Nigerian market of fake batteries. Offorjama, who described the development as alarming, said the substandard and fake automotive batteries gave no value to users and may force manufacturers to close shops. He said the menace of substandard batteries was a major threat to battery manufacturers and assemblers who, he said, added value to the nation’s economy through revenue generation, job creation and manufacturing of products which, he noted, complied with laid down standards of SON. Also speaking, Kwara State Director of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Esther Okon, said the use of locally manufactured goods would prevent the country from being used as a dumping ground, adding that consumers’ confidence would also be boosted.
