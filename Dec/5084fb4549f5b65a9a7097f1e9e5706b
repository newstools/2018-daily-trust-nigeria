A House of Representatives candidate for Abuja South federal constituency, Alhaji Hassan Usman Sokodabo, has urged members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to unite and dislodge the ruling party in next year’s general elections. Sokodabo,stated this while addressing former APC members who defected to PDP in Kwaku ward of Kuje Area Council yesterday. He said time had come for all members and supporters of the PDP to ensure that APC was voted out of office without any quarrel because of what he described as their poor performance. He also cautioned some members of the party not to allow any candidate seeking for elective position to persuade them to vote along religious and ethnic lines, saying some politicians who used religion and ethnicity to win elections had failed to provide viable amenities to the people. He added, “Today we understand that the person you people voted for in the last election claimed to have constructed a dam here in this village, where is the dam? At least, if such money was used to grade the road, it would have reduced the hardship facing people of this village.” Emmanuel Musa, who spoke on behalf of the 156 APC defectors, said they left the APC because its administration had abandoned the community.
