A former Chief of Army Staff,  Lt.-Gen. Alani Akinrinade, at the weekend in Lagos, urged the media to minimise the impact of false reportage of happenings in the war against insurgency. Speaking at the 81 Division West African Social Activities held at the 65 Battallion Parade Ground, he said: “The exaggerated and sometimes entirely fabricated falsehood on the social media and the possible repercussion on morale of our troops must be incalculable.
