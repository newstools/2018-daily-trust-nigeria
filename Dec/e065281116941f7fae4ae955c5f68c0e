The Kogi State Internal Revenue Service (KIRS) weekend shut a private radio station, Tao FM and Always Filing Station, both in Okene, for alleged non-compliance with the stateâ€™s Registration of Business Premises Law. The radio station, which transmits across Kogi Central Senatorial District and beyond, was said to have been pleading for tax holiday since the beginning of the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello; while Always Petroleum had allegedly failed to renew its business premises levy. Director of Legal Services and Enforcement at KIRS, Mr Isah Jamil, who led the enforcement team, said the government could not continue to grant the radio station tax holiday while others in the same corporate entity appropriately redeemed their tax obligations to the state.
