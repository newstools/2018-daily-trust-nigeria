Local government council chairmen in Nigeria have been asked to mobilise the grassroots electorate not to vote for governorship candidates opposed to local government autonomy in next year’s general elections. The chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Hon. Adamu Candido, made the call, yesterday, in Abuja while declaring open the maiden conference of the Association of Local Government Vice Chairmen of Nigeria. He said governors not in support of local government autonomy should not be in office. Candido charged participants at the conference themed ‘Prospects and Challenges of Local Government in Nigeria’, to be resolute in fighting the ill-treatment of council chairmen by state governors who, he said, sat on councils’ allocations in the name of joint account. In his opening remarks, the National Chairman, Association of Local Government Vice Chairmen, Hon. Lawrence Onuchukwu, promised to reinvent the organisation towards achieving good results for the interest of local government councils in the country.
