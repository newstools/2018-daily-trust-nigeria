Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) say it is targeting 300 million standard cubic feet of gas per day from Assa North Gas Development Project in Imo State when it comes on stream. The gas is expected to be treated at SPDC JV’s gas processing facility and distributed through the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben pipeline network. The Managing Director of SPDC and Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Osagie Okunbor, who disclosed this in Lagos in a statement, also announced that the Final Investment Decision (FID) on the gas development project was taken to meet the Federal Government’s aspiration for increased power generation and industrialisation. He noted that the project would be a major game-changer in Nigeria’s quest for energy sufficiency and economic growth. “This is good news for the SPDC JV and Nigeria as we look to grow the domestic market and optimise our onshore footprints,” Okunbor said adding that “the project is key to driving the Federal Government of Nigeria’s ambition of marching away from a mono-economy through diverse industrial growth.”    Shell signs gas supply agreement for Aba power project SPDC JV partners PETAN, foreign manufacturers on Nigerian content Shell Nigeria considers investment in gas project in Niger Delta
