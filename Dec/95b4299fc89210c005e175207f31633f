A Rwandan court in Kigali has acquitted government critic Diane Rwigara and her mother of charges of inciting insurrection and forgery. Ms Rwigara was imprisoned for over a year, after being barred from running in presidential elections against the incumbent Paul Kagame. The opposition leader, 37, faced up to 22 years in prison for charges she said were politically motivated. A three-judge panel told a packed room all the charges were “baseless”.
