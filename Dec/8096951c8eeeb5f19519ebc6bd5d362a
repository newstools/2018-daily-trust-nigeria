The District Head of Matazu, Katsina State, Alhaji Iro Maikano, has asked his subject to always look inwards for solutions to the problems affecting the area. Alhaji Iro, who is also the Fagachin Katsina, made the appeal at a general meeting he called to discuss the various issues affecting the people. He said community self help was one of the best ways to address such issues as the government was so overwhelmed and could not solve all problems facing the people. He said, with little contribution from all, a lot could be achieved adding that working together for a common goal was desirable and the surest way of advancing any community. The District Head noted the reduction in the incidence of security breaches which he attributed to the support being given to vigilante groups working in the area, along with the police. In his remarks, the chairman of the council Kabir Faruk commended the effort of the royal father to bring the people together to address major concerns. “On our part the council has lent more support to security agencies and 170 vigilante groups. “We are visibly seeing the result. In the past, this our main road was always under attack but nowadays normalcy  has returned “ he said. Arewa Trust reports that the meeting resolved to constitute a 10-man committee in each village which would meet regularly, to identify and forward peculiar  problems affecting the village. It also reiterated the need for community policing and encouraged individuals to closely monitor and report any suspicious person to appropriate authority. Arewa Trust reports that a donation of two motor vehicles, 15 motorcycles and cash to further boost security information gathering and operations was received during the meeting.‎
