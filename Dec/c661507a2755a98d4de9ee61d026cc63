The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has urged Nigerian to avoid electoral violence, vote buying and other malpractices that may mar the 2019 general elections. This is contained in the 2019 New Year message by CAN President, Dr. Samson Olasupo Ayokunle. According to him, Nigeria’s ‘dry bones’ shall rise again, adding that 2019 is a crucial year to all Nigerians. “I therefore urge all Nigerians to make sure that they abide in peace without being involved in violence throughout the year, especially before, during and after the election. “We should all distant ourselves from electoral manipulation in whatever form. I urge politicians not to be too desperate to be voted into power and get themselves involved in using thugs to cause chaos or commit electoral fraud. “Vote buying is evil, all stakeholders should shun it. All the law enforcement agencies, especially the Police and the Nigerian Civil Defence Corps deployed to maintain peace should not compromise their neutrality by working for desperate politicians. “The military should not be dragged into the electoral process but instead, they should be allowed to face their primary responsibilities. “Voters should not be intimidated and election observers should not be harassed like we witnessed in recent polls,” Ayokunle said. He also urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and their personnel to maintain neutrality in their conducts before and throughout the period of the election.
