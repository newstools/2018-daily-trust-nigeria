A former governor of Ekiti state, Ayodele Fayose, on Monday said the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate in the 2019 poll, President Muhammadu Buhari, has lost all the goodwill to seek for re-election, saying it’s time for him to leave office. Fayose disclosed this in a goodwill message at a youth town-hall meeting in Lagos organised for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, as part of his ongoing campaign for 2019 Presidency. He claimed that 90 percent of Nigerians have resolved to vote for Atiku. This, according to him, explains why the APC can’t go out to campaign because there is nothing to show Nigerians that they achieved in the last three years. He alleged that the ruling party and Buhari are planning to rig the 2019 election just as he advised Nigerians to resist the plan. “There is difference between democracy and military rule. Our candidate, a former Vice-President, is a product of democracy. He has what it takes to lead Nigeria. APC is left with rigging and vote-buying but we will not allow that to happen”, Fayose said. Many youth leaders who spoke at the town hall meeting said Atiku’s plan is youth-focused and vowed to resist any attempt to rig the 2019 elections. A youth leader, Bodunrin Oriade, said Nigeria needs a president who is an entrepreneur, noting that Nigeria has not been fortunate to produce one, saying this is what Atiku/Obi ticket will correct. The town-hall meeting had in attendance Atiku Abubakar, his running mate, Peter Obi, and members of the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) led by the National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus. Also in attendance is the PDP governorship candidate in Lagos, Jimi Agbaje and his running mate, Haleemat Busari, among other notable dignitaries.
