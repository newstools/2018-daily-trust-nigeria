The Ekiti State Government yesterday received N3.9 billion from the Federal Government as the last tranche of its Paris Club refund. Governor Kayode Fayemi directed that the money be applied to pay one month of outstanding arrears to state and local government workers, teachers and pensioners in line with his promise. According to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Yinka Oyebode, the Paris Club refund was received following President Mohammadu Buhari’s intervention in the matter, after Fayemi’s last week visit to the President. He said Fayemi assured workers that his administration would explore all avenues to clear their five to eight months salaries owed them by the immediate past administration, within a reasonable period.
