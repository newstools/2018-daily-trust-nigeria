President of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Comrade  Bobboi Bala Kaigama, is to serve as  the Campaign Director-General of Taraba State APC governorship candidate, Alhaji Sani Abubakar Danladi. Comrade Kaigama, while assuming the office on Saturday in Jalingo, said he had handed over his former gubernatorial campaign office and vehicles to Sani Danladi. The TCU president said he accepted to be the DG of the campaign despite losing at the primaries to Danladi because party supremacy implied that members must allow party interest to take pre-eminence. He also said that he handed over his campaign office and structure to the APC candidate to ensure smooth operations of the party, assuring that the APC will win Taraba in 2019. Comrade Kaigama said all APC members must allow party interest to take pre-eminence over their personal ambitions. Responding, the APC governorship candidate, Alhaji Sani Danladi, said Governor Darius Ishaku and the PDP were already jittery because it was clear that they would lose the election in 2019. Danladi, who spoke at the launching of his campaign office donated by Kaigama, said the allegations by Governor Ishaku that the APC was plotting to rig him out in 2019 was just an indirect way of expressing his apprehension that the people were not with him.
