A 52-year-old mechanic, Abiodun Sikiru, who allegedly eloped with his customer’s car valued at N2.8 million, has been arraigned at an Ikeja, Lagos, chief magistrate court. Sikiru, who lives at No. 63, Akinwale Street, Igando, Lagos, is facing a four-count charge that include breach of the peace, stealing and false pretence. The prosecutor, Sergeant Michael Unah, told the court that the accused stole one Ford Focus car registration number AX 709 KUJ worth N2.8m, property of one Mr Jimie Enobong, sometime in February 2016 at No. 237, Ikorodu Road, Ilupeju, Lagos. He added that the accused unlawfully obtained a sum of N500,000 from Enobong on the pretext of using the money to fix the gear box of the car, a representation the prosecutor said Sikiru knew to be false. He also affirmed that the accused conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by driving away the car to an unknown destination without the consent of its owner. “The accused had collected the car from the complainant for repair since two years ago. He did not repair the car nor did he refund the money he had collected for its repair. All efforts made to retrieve the car from him proved abortive,” Unah said. Sikiru, however, pleaded not guilty to the four-count charge. The chief magistrate, Mr A. A. Fashola, granted him bail in the sum of N500,000, with two sureties in like sum and adjourned the case till February 6, 2019 for hearing.
