Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday assured the South-West that President Muhammadu Buhari would hand over government to a South-westerner, if the region supports him for next year’s elections. Osinbajo, who engaged in house to house campaign in Oyo and held a 45-minute closed door meeting with the Alaafin, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, said, “2019 presidential election matters to the Yoruba people of the Southwest because the region has a larger interest in 2023”. The VP, who earlier in Ibadan, the state capital, inaugurated Shared Facilities for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Ibadan, financed by the Bank of Industry, declared that the project which is the maiden edition is a Federal Government initiative in collaboration with the Oyo State Government. The Shared Facilities is for fashion, style and shea butter producers who cannot afford the cost of buying the equipment selling at millions of naira in the market, Daily Trust on Sunday gathered. The Director of Bank of Industry, (BOI) Mr Olukayode Pitan, lauded the project, saying Shared Facilities would operate as one of the National MSMEs Clinics and adopt a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model to guarantee success and sustainability. Osinbajo, who noted that small scale enterprises play significant roles in the economic growth of the nation, called on traders to support the President’s re-election bid to enjoy more of Tradermoni packaged to support the traders. The Vice President, accompanied by the Governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, APC gubernatorial candidate, Chief Bayo Adelabu, former Senate Leader and APC senatorial candidate for Oyo-central senatorial district, Senator Teslim Folarin, eulogised Oba Adeyemi, for his wisdom which he said is secondary to none in the South-west. However, last week, the Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, while hosting members of the Orlu Zone Congress of Journalists (OZCOJ) in his office, described himself as the rallying point for all Ndigbo and the only one who can bridge unity, understanding and togetherness for Ndigbo in order to realize Igbo presidency in 2023. The governor, who is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) explained that campaigns of calumny against him was because his detractors have realised that he is the most eligible and most detribalised Igbo man accepted by other tribes and nationalities in Nigeria.
