The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has stayed action on the planned withdrawal of security and fire-fighting services to some debtor-airports in the country. The airports are Kebbi, Gombe and Osubi airport in Warri Delta State owned by the state government and private operator. It was learnt that the suspension, which would have disrupted flight operations in the affected airports, was to give room for more negotiation with the authority. Spokesperson of FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, told our correspondent that the airports were ready to negotiate with the authority to reconcile their debts. It said the action became imperative as the management of Gombe airport was indebted to it to the tune of N607,289,972, while Kebbi and Bebi airports were indebted to the tune of N124,547,240 and N76,772,948, respectively, without any concerted effort to pay up the debt. Based on the notice, Arik Air had made plans for its services and moved its flight operation to other airports. Meanwhile, the management of Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited (BASL), operators of the domestic wing of Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal Two (MMA2), insists it does not owe FAAN N1.9bn as claimed by the authority. In a statement, BASL reiterated that it has a judgment credit of N132, 540,580,304 (one hundred thirty-two billion, five hundred forty million, five hundred eighty thousand, three hundred four Naira) since March 3, 2009 which arose “directly from the non-implementation of the Concession Agreement by the appropriate authorities”.
