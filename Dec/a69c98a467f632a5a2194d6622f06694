An APC chieftain in Lagos State, Chief Tajudeen Olusi, dismissed the endorsement of Atiku, saying Buhari who he described as “God-sent” remains the choice of the South West in the 2019 elections. Chief Olusi said the zone would soon come up with a position on who to back officially in 2019. Speaking with Daily Trust, he said, “At the appropriate time and not too long, the Yoruba people will speak, but I want to tell you and assure you from my knowledge that majority of the Yoruba people, those who occupy South West Nigeria, have a preferred candidate and that candidate is Muhammadu Buhari, the present God-sent president of our country.” When contacted on the purported endorsement, spokesman of Afenifere, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, said the position of the group remained that it would back any presidential candidate with a restructuring agenda, stressing that the group was in conjunction with other southern groups.
