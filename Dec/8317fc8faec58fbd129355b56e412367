Kano State House of Assembly had suspended the Managing Director of Kano Agricultural Supply Company (KASCO), Alhaji Mohummad Bala Inuwa, for refusal to appear before the house to defend budget allocated to his agency. Consequently, the house declared zero allocation to the agency for the year 2019. The Speaker of the House, Alhaji Kabiru Alhassan Rurum, made the disclosure on Monday shortly after the Committee of the whole House deliberated on various pressing issues including MD’s failure to appear before the House. Rurum said that the suspension of the managing director followed his refusal to appear before the House committee on Agriculture to defend the 2019 budget allocated to his agency. “In spite of the efforts by members of the committee to reach the MD on phone to appear before the committee, the man failed to pick any of calls put to his phone,” he said. He added that in view of this development, the House unanimously approved the suspension of his agency.
