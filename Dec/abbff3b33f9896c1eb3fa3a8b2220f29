A Karmo Grade I Area Court, on yesterday, sentenced  a 32-year-old man to two months in prison for stealing a Samsung J1 mobile phone in a bank  valued at N 45,000. The Judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, however, gave the convict, Mohammed Yakubu, an option to pay N3,000 fine and advised him to be of good behaviour. The convict, who resides in Gwagwalada Area 1 Park, Abuja, was arraigned, tried and convicted after he pleaded guilty to a count charge of theft. The Prosecutor, Mrs Ukagha Ijeoma, earlier told the court that one Aguodi Michael of the United Bank for Africa (UBA), Utako, Abuja, on November 8, reported the matter at the Utako Police Station.

She said during investigation, the convict confessed to the crime. The offence, she said, contravened Section 288 of the Penal Code.
