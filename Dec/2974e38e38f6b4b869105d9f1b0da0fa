People of Itobe community in Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi State yesterday protested against the alleged move by the Attah Igala to impose a woman on the traditional stool of Amana of Itobe. Daily Trust gathered that the protest which began from the palace of the Attah Igala in Idah spread to Itobe community. The chairman of the Itobe Community Development Association, Danjuma Alhassan, told our correspondent that the protest was over the alleged move to impose one Hajiya Ramatu Ibrahim on the people following the demise of the Amana of Itobe, Chief Mohammed Egbunu Obaje, who died about three weeks ago. “It is about chieftaincy and land matters. The throne of Amana of Itobe is a traditional throne and it is hereditary. It belongs to the family of Amana and not to any other person. “But the present Gabaidu (Attah Igala) wants to forcefully take the throne away from the owners of the throne. “He wants to hand over the chieftaincy stool to a woman which is a taboo. The present Gabaidu wants to impose a woman on the people of Itobe and that is why we are protesting”, he said. He appealed to the state government and other relevant institutions to intervene to forestall any breakdown of law and order. When contacted, Secretary to the Attah Igala, Alhaji Adama Suleiman, denied the allegations, saying “Attah Igala is not trying to impose any woman on them; it is not true”.
