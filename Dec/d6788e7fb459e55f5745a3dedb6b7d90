The chairman, Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has presented N8.257,881,086 billion as the proposed budget for 2019. The 2019 estimates show a two per cent nominal decrease from the previous year’s estimates. Presenting the budget at the legislative chambers at AMAC secretariat, Abuja, Candido said the estimates would take care of the growing needs of communities and the requests of various departments in the area council. Candido said N4.1 billion was allocated for recurrent expenditure, representing 49.17 per cent and N4.2 billion for capital expenditure, representing 50.83 per cent of the budget. He said allocation to personnel cost was N2.8 billion representing 33.51 per cent and an overhead of N1.29 billion, saying that the increase was mainly due to provisions for staff promotion arrears, annual increment and possible recruitment of confidential secretaries and potential salary increase. According to him, allocating 51 per cent of the 2019 budget to capital projects was to demonstrate a strong commitment to continue to develop infrastructure across the 12 wards of the council. “The thrust of AMAC projection for 2019 will be the completion of many ongoing projects, adding that to consolidate on the momentum of the 2018 budget implementation, many ongoing capital projects have been provided for in the 2019 budget. “This is in line with our commitment to appropriately fund all ongoing capital projects to completion. By allocating 51 per cent of the 2019 budget to capital projects, the council is also demonstrating its strong commitment to continue to develop our infrastructure across the 12 wards of the council. “Although a lot of progress has been made, the huge contractual liabilities we inherited and the ban on tenement rate collection, although recently lifted, coupled with non-remittance of Paris Club refund have adversely impacted on our infrastructural development timetable,” he said. He expressed hope that the legislators would expedite action on the budget so that the council could commence implementation in earnest. The Speaker of AMAC legislative council, Daniel Michael, commended the chairman for the implementation of the 2018 budget which, he said, was between 80 and 90 per cent.
