The Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr Osita Okechukwu, yesterday said that the 2019 presidential election was not only a battle against rogue culture but also for the soul of the country. Okechukwu spoke in Abuja when he received a delegation of Buhari Students National Support Group (BSNSG) led by Comrade Idowu Odebunmi. He added that the 2019 battle is between President Muhammadu Buhari, who frowned against looting of public funds, and those who cherished the local slogan of ‘share the money’. The VON DG said President Buhari had been slow and steady in fulfilling the All Progressives Congress (APC) promise to stop the culture of impunity as part of the change agenda. Okechukwu added that the battle against rogue culture was a prelude to meaningful restructuring of the country as no meaningful restructuring would take place in the midst of broken ethical moral attitudes, despondency and deficit critical infrastructure. He urged the students to join President Buhari in waging war against rogue culture to fast-track the diversification of the economy and sustainable development, saying the president’s re-election is more rewarding and certain than former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. Earlier, the leader of the group, Comrade Odebunmi, said they decided to support the re-election of President Buhari to secure the future of Nigerian youth and encourage him to consolidate his achievements.
