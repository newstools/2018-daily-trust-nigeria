The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said procurement plans are ongoing to build the North Core transmission line worth £27 million (about N12.402 billion) to connect Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso and raise Nigeria’s energy export capacity. The Managing Director of (TCN) and Chairman, West African Power Pool’s (WAPP) Executive Board, Mr Usman Gur Mohammed, disclosed this yesterday in Abuja at the joint technical working group of WAPP. He said: “The North Core will run from Nigeria to Niger and Burkina Faso. It will also tee-off from the line that goes to Niger to northern Benin. The aspect of the line that concerns Nigeria is that from Birnin Kebbi to the border with Niger and its cost is £27 million.” Mr Mohammed said Nigeria was ready to export the excess electricity that the Distribution Companies (DisCos) could not deliver to consumers so the country can earn more foreign exchange. Presently, Nigeria exports electricity to Niger, Benin and Togo. He said Nigeria was keying into higher energy export because generation was cheaper and many countries were willing to buy from the country. He however noted that the country’s grid frequency must be synchronised with those of WAPP country members to enable the trade, which necessitated the meeting. Mohammed said: “We are doing a meeting for the synchronisation of the interconnections between the various countries. The intention is to synchronise them because WAPP wants to ensure that energy flows from Nigeria to Senegal and back. “We want to synchronise to bring our frequency level to that of WAPP standard – 49.80 and 50.20 Hertz, which is the standard all of us must look towards. When we achieve that and synchronise our networks, energy will flow across,” he noted.
