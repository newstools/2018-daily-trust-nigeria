A Member of the House of Representatives, Johnson Agbonayinma (APC, Edo), has alleged that “some disgruntled lawmakers in the National Assembly” are collecting signatures to impeach the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. House Spokesman, Abdulrazaq Namdas, was quick to distance the House of Representatives from any move to impeach the Vice President. Namdas told Daily Trust that although he was not supposed to speak for individual members of the House, there was nothing to suggest that the legislators were planning to impeach Osinbajo. In his words, “As far as I am concerned, and from the position of the House of Representatives in which I am the spokesman, there is nothing before us that has to do with the impeachment of the vice president. Just like Namdas, the Chairman, House Committee on Ethics and Privileges, Nicholas Ossai (PDP, Delta) said neither him as a person nor the committee is aware of any plan to impeach the vice president. It would take two-third of the 360 member House of Reps to impeach a sitting president or vice president. Even then, the Rep members need the concurrence of the Senate to effect the impeachment. Hon. Agbonayinma said in a statement that the lawmakers were banking on the recent House of Representatives report that allegedly indicted the vice president of illegally approving N5.8bn for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in clear breach of extant laws.
