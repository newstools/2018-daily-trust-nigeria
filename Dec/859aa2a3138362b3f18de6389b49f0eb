The French government says it fears “major violence” in Paris on Saturday as the national “yellow vests” protest movement shows little sign of easing. The government said it was scrapping the fuel tax increases in its budget – the original spark for the protests. But broader discontent with the government has spread, and protests have erupted over several other issues. On Thursday young people took to the streets, protesting over educational reforms. More than 140 people were arrested when a protest outside a school in Mantes-la-Jolie in Yvelines ended in clashes with police.
