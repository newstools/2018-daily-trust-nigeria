Governors Kashim Shettima of Borno and other members of the APC national peace and reconciliation committee for the South West, yesterday, met in Ibadan with a Social Democratic Party (SDP) group from Osun State led by Senator Iyiola Omisore as part of the committee’s engagements with strategic allies. The group is also reaching out to aggrieved APC members across the six states of the South West for interactive sessions. Governor Shettima chairs ‎the committee with Governor Nasiru El-Rufai as vice chairman; while Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State, former deputy governor of Ekiti State, Professor Modupe Adelabu, the D-G of NIMASA, Dr. Dakuku Peterside and Barrister Sa’ida Sa’ad Bugaje are members. The meeting with Omisore which was held behind closed door reportedly deliberated on the way forward. Members of the committee were also expected to meet with the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yusuph Lasun also from Osun as well as Minister of Communication, Adebayo Shittu from Oyo. A statement signed by the secretary of the committee, Isa Umar Gusau, said six aggrieved members, three from Oyo and three from Osun had an interface with the committee even though none of them submitted any written petition. “We have received the least number of aggrieved members here in Ibadan from both Oyo and Osun states. This bears testimony to the efforts made by the governors of Oyo and Osun  who have made significant reconciliation efforts,” the statement said. “In his remarks Governor Ambode who corroborated an earlier reference of him by Shettima, called on aggrieved members to borrow from him in helping to build peace in the interest of the APC ahead of the 2019 general elections,” the statement said.
