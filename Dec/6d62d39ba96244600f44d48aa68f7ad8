Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State has promised to reward all party members that work diligently towards the return of the APC in the 2019 general elections. Masari spoke at the launching of four different empowerment packages by some political appointees and elected officials from Batagarawa, Rimi and Charanchi local government areas. He said as party members, they should work diligently to ensure that the party had a successful outing in the 2019 elections. “Only few appointees and elected officials are showing what the party principle of empowering people is,” he observed. According to him, some appointees and elected officials only showed their faces once in three months in Katsina without meeting the electorate. “The time has come for such appointees to reciprocate the gesture of Mr. President by ensuring the return of the party,” he said. In their separate remarks, some of the sponsors, including Kabir Shuaibu who is the member representing Rimi/Batagarawa/Charanchi Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, and the Managing Director of Federal Mortgage Bank, Arc Ahmed Musa Dangiwa, said the items donated were aimed at empowering the less privileged and the most vulnerable in the area and assured of their readiness to continue to support their constituents.
