The Nigerian Army has alleged that Amnesty International Nigeria is working to destabilize Nigeria, Army spokesman, Brigadier General Sani Usman has said. In a statement by the Army on Monday, the Army spokesman said: “The Nigerian branch of Amnesty International that has hitherto been well respected has deviated from the core values, principles and objectives of the original Amnesty International domiciled in the United Kingdom. “There is credible information that the Nigerian branch of the International Non-governmental Organisation is determined to destabilise the Nigerian nation. “This is noted through fabrication of fictitious allegations of alleged human rights abuses against the Nigerian security forces and clandestine sponsorship of dissident groups to protest, as well as unfounded allegations against the leadership of the Nigerian military. “They have tried over the years using Boko Haram terrorists’ conflicts, Islamic Movement in Nigeria, some activists and now herders-farmers conflicts.” He said the NGO is at the verge of releasing yet another concocted report against the military, ostensibly against the Nigerian Army. He warned that, “Nigerians should be wary of Amnesty International (Nigeria) because its goals are to destabilise Nigeria and to dismember it. “The Nigerian Army has no option than to call for the closure of Amnesty International offices in Nigeria, if such recklessness continues.” …Police, army refute report Army rejects Amnesty crimes report Amnesty report: ‘Nigerian military doesn’t engage in mass murder’
