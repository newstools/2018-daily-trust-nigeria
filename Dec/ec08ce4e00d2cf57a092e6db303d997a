Some chieftains of the National Conscience Party (NCP) in Lagos State have reiterated their angst over the decision of the national leadership of the party to join the alliance of opposition parties, insisting the decision runs contrary to the principle of the founding father, late Chief Gani Fawehinmi. They have therefore resolved to remain in the party and deploy every legitimate weapon to fight the battle and save the party from bondage. NCP is one of the over 30 political parties that formed the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) to take over power from the ruling APC. CUPP had also resolved to back the aspiration of the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Prior to the consummation of the CUPP alliance, some chieftains of NCP in Lagos had kicked against the plan by the national leadership chaired by Dr Tanko Yakasai to be part of CUPP, insisting it was against the philosophy of the founder of the party. But Yakasai stood his ground, saying the alliance was in the best interest of the party which has not won any elective position, adding that the CUPP platform would give more visibility to the party. But in a yuletide message to members in Lagos at the weekend, the state NCP stressed that since 2004, successive leaderships of the party had conspired to thwart the growth and progress of the party. According to the statement signed by the General Secretary, NCP Lagos, Yusuff Omuya, members should prepare their minds beyond 2019 as the national leadership has sold the party to those it called, “enemies of the working masses”. It regretted that the party would not be participating in the 2019 elections “as a result of the bondage of a very highly corrupt, unprincipled and irresponsible alliance of NCP with the PDP led CUPP”.
