Members of the House of Representatives have threatened to boycott the 2019 budget proposals presentation unless the Minister of Budget, Udo Udoma, tendered an unreserved public apology to them. President Mohamamdu Buhari will formally lay the budget proposals before the National Assembly on Wednesday, December 19, 2018. The lawmakers issued the threat, Thursday morning, after Speaker Yakubu Dogara read a letter from the President requesting to present the budget before the National Assembly on December 19. “May I crave the kind indulgence of the House of Representatives to formally present the 2019 budget before the joint session of the National Assembly on Wednesday, December 19, 2018,” Buhari’s letter said. Recall that the Minister of Budget and National Planning, Udo Udoma, was yesterday quoted as saying that members of the National Assembly were behind the delay in the presentation of the 2019 budget. Invoking Order 6, Rule 14 of the House Standing Orders, Abubakar Adamu (APC, Niger) requested that the lawmakers demand immediate, unreserved and public apology from Udoma or boycott the budget presentation. He said the Minister had lied against the lawmakers and portrayed the National Assembly as an irresponsible institution. “The Minister of Budget and National Planning lied in order to portray the National Assembly as an irresponsible institution. “We hereby demand total, unreserved public apology or the President will meet an empty House when he comes to present the budget,” the fuming Adamu said. Other lawmakers supported Adamu’s position, including Rotimi Agunsoye (APC, Lagos) who moved that the House summon Udo Udoma. Mark Gbillah (APC, Benue) also maintained that the Minister lied, and thus requested a formal, public apology from him.
