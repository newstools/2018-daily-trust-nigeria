There is tension in Kogi State as to why the Deputy Governor of the state, Elder Simon Achuba, has embarked on a two-month annual leave. To douse the tension, in a statement issued yesterday in Lokoja by the Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, Sylvester Akor, said Elder Achuba proceeded on two months annual leave beginning from November 26, 2018, which would end on January 26, 2019. Akor said, “This information is necessary to clear the air on the rumour being peddled that the deputy governor is not on leave.” In a letter dated November 19, 2018, and addressed to Gov. Yahaya Bello, Achuba requested for approval to proceed on annual leave.” Daily Trust reports that the deputy governor’s “long annual leave” is coming amid reports of alleged existence of a frosty relationship between him and Gov. Bello. Achuba, who is said to have been allegedly sidelined in the scheme of things in the state for some time, has, however, maintained silence on the matter. This is just as the Kogi State Government said Gov. Bello had handed over to the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole, to act on his behalf before departing with President Muhammadu Buhari for the Climate Change Summit in Poland.
