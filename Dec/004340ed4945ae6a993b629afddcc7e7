Four persons the police in Lagos described as specialists in the production of adulterated disinfectants of various brands and air fresheners have been arrested. The suspects, identified as Francais Ume, 32; Chidubem Achezie, 44; Peter Ume, 44; and Ejike Jacob, 41, were arrested following a tip-off from residents of the Okokomaiko area of the Lagos metropolis. Daily Trust learnt that the Divisional Police Officer, Okokomaiko Division, Chief Superintendent Aliyu Lukman, led his men to the hideout of the suspects early this week, where they were all rounded up. A truck loaded with cartons of a disinfectant with the Dettol label and Airwick air fresheners with an estimated value of over N7 million were said to have been recovered from the suspects. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who paraded the suspects at the Command Headquaters, Ikeja, yesterday said the suspects were arrested in a room they were allegedly using to manufacture the fake products that they sold in the open market. Speaking on his involvement in the criminal act, Ume said he was only hired to seal the products. When asked who hired him, he kept mute. Achezie said he had no idea the gang was involved in such an illegality, saying he had an accommodation problem and had gone to squat with Jacob when he was arrested.
