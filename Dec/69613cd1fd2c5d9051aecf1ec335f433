The owner of a clothing store in the UK is taking an unconventional approach to preventing theft. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, wants to hire skilled thieves to come in and steal from her store and then tell her how they did it, so she can prevent it from happening again. The witty entrepreneur posted a job offer on Bark.com, which quickly went viral, offering thieves £50 (about N23,000) an hour to come in and try to steal from her store, plus the chance to keep three of the things they manage to steal. Candidates would need to visit her store on a number of occasions over several weeks and then produce a report of all the things they stole and how they did it. Realizing that her job may come off as strange, the woman explained that she is simply taking a different approach to theft prevention after years of suffering significant loses during the holiday season. “I’m looking for a professional to help highlight security weaknesses in my store, by deliberately stealing from it,” the store owner wrote. “I’ve been a business owner since I opened my retail shop in 2013, and have experienced extensive theft every year in the run-up to Christmas for the last five years.”  Culled from odditycentral.com Page 25 Women in Business Father of 7 drugs woman, attempts to steal her car NDLEA arrests woman with 49 bags of Indian hemp
