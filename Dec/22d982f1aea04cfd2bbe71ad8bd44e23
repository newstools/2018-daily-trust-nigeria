The presidential candidate of the People’s Trust (PT), Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has accused the APC and the PDP of playing politics with the nation’s stability through the way and manner they are handling the electoral act. Olawepo-Hashim, in a statement issued by his campaign team, said rather than presenting themselves as statesmen, the candidates of the two parties were rather obsessed with immediate partisan gains. He told reporters at an interactive session in Lagos while reacting to the president’s refusal to give accent to the electoral act, which he said was passed by the PDP-controlled National Assembly, that the supposed top actors were falling below standard. The candidate said the PDP-led legislature had ample time to correct the perceived “lacunas” in the electoral act, which he said they created in the first instance, but were rather distracting the polity with it. The PT presidential candidate called on the electorate and the entire citizens of Nigeria not to be discouraged from participating in the polls as a result of the shenanigans of APC and PDP.
