The Catholic Bishop of Maiduguri Diocese, Bishop Oliver Doeme Dashe, has expressed determination to sustain his tradition of offering kola nut gifts to the Shehu of Borno, Borno State governor, the three senators and other prominent personalities of the state at Christmas to foster goodwill between Muslims and Christians. Speaking to journalists in Maiduguri, Bishop Dashe, also warned Christians against borrowing money to celebrate Christmas. “I am used to sending kola nut gifts to the Shehu of Borno, the state governor, the senators and other prominent people of the state during Christmas in expression of goodwill between Muslims and Christians, and I will do so this Christmas,” he said. The Catholic Bishop warned: “Christians should abstain from borrowing money just to buy new clothes, unnecessary food items and drinks just to celebrate Christmas. “People have formed the habit of borrowing so much just to celebrate this one day; and they become heavily indebted to the point of not being able to pay their children’s school fees and discharge other obligations to their families; this is wrong,” he said. He also prayed for a peaceful 2019 general elections. Why I am attracted to Gov Shettima – Archbishop Kaigama CAN commends gov Shettima over Boko Haram Low turnout in churches at peaceful Christmas
