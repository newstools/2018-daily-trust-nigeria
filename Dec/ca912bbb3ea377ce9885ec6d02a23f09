Tear gas has been fired in Democratic Republic of Congo at protesters angry that several opposition strongholds have been left out of Sundayâ€™s polls. Electoral officials have postponed voting in three cities until March, citing insecurity and Ebola concerns. But with the new president due to be sworn in next month, it appears the votes of more than a million people will be discounted. The opposition accuses the authorities of seeking to rig the ballot. Voting was postponed in the opposition strongholds of Beni and Butembo in the east, and the city of Yumbi in the west. In Goma, the main city in eastern DR Congo and also an opposition stronghold, crowds blocked a road in the Majengo neighbourhood and around the university. Anti-riot police are positioned at some street corners in Majengo, and protesters retreated after tear gas was fired.
