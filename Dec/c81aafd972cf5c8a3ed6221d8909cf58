The Lagos State government has unveiled plans to deploy a Rapid Intervention Squad (RIS), body cameras and other forms of technology to curtail the growing traffic gridlock in the state. The Commissioner for Transportation, Ladi Lawanson, disclosed this at a briefing to announce measures the government was taking to address the challenges associated with the transportation system in the state. Lawanson said the state government would be partnering with other security agencies to ensure the effectiveness of the RIS. He added the use of the intervention squad would complement the efforts of the officials of the Lagos State Transportation Management Authority (LASTMA). “We will also be deploying body cameras, among other forms of technology, to aid transparent management of traffic offences. This is because there have been complaints from the people about our officers’ approach, while our officers have also complained about the non-cooperation of the many road users. With the body cameras, we can have a transparent understanding of events,” he said.
