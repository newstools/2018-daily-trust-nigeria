An ex-APC governorship aspirant in Borno State, Attom Muhammad Magira, has appealed to his fellow aspirants who are aggrieved by the outcome of the election to rescind their decision to go to court. Citing alleged irregularities, some of the defeated aspirants had rejected the outcome of the election which produced Prof. Babagana Zuma. This was followed by a series of reconciliatory moves to assuage their grief and pleas for them to cooperate with Prof. Zulum to succeed at the election. However, one of the aggrieved aspirants, Idris Mamman Durkwa, who came second at the primary election, has already sued the party, Professor Zulum and INEC at a Maiduguri Federal High Court, seeking the nullification of Zulum’s candidature. He is also urging the court to declare him (Durkwa) as the rightful candidate. While hearing on the substantive suit was being awaited, other aspirants had perfected plans to file another case in Abuja. “I heard that seven of them are going to court on Thursday in Abuja following what President Buhari said that any aggrieved aspirant can go to court,” Magira told Daily Trust on phone, arguing, “I am also an aggrieved aspirant, but I have submitted myself to peace and reconciliation because I have appreciated the need for peace. “They should also appreciate the need for peace and rescind their decision to go to court in the interest of peace, considering the dire situation the state is emerging from, so that we do not vex the situation, which would be to our own detriment,” he said.
