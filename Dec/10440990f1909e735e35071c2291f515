The Senate yesterday waded into the imbroglio surrounding the payment of N800 billion subsidy debt as its committee on downstream will be meeting with leadership of Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) Major Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN),Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in Abuja today. Besides, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele will on Thursday be having similar meeting with DAPMAN in Abuja. According to DAPPMAN Executive Secretary, Olufemi Adewole, the meeting with the Senate committee has been scheduled for tomorrow evening. DAPPMAN had early on Monday suspended its earlier directive to commence shutdown of depots across the country from loading petroleum products effective from 12-midnight on Monday. The union also resolved to recall its disengaged personnel for 5-days to give the Federal government’s team the opportunity to conclude its process of paying marketers the full outstanding of N800 billion with the first trench being the amount already approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) DAPPMA said that the decision of government claiming to settle N236 billion out of the outstanding N800 subsidy arrears was not acceptable to DAPPMA members, leading to last week’s Thursday meeting which ended in a deadlock.
