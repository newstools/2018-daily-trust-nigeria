Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed US President Donald Trump’s decision to send troops home from Syria after declaring victory over the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS). “The fact that the US has decided to withdraw its troops is right,” Putin told a press conference on Thursday. Trump announced on Wednesday that all US troops would be withdrawn from Syria and that ISIL had been “defeated”. The Russian president said that “as concerns the victory over IS, on the whole, I agree with the US president,” adding that “we have dealt serious blows against IS in Syria.” Trump’s decision to pull out completely was confirmed by US officials and is expected to take place in the coming months. Nevertheless, Putin cast doubt on Washington’s plans, saying “we don’t see any signs of withdrawing US troops yet, but I concede that it is possible.” Putin visits Syria airbase, orders start of pull-out Vladimir Putin Plunges Into a Cauldron: Saving Assad Obama: No US troops on Syria front lines
