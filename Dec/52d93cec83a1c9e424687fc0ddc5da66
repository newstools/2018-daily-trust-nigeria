The House of Representatives, yesterday, held a plenary session without the one-third quorum required by the constitution before a legislative business can be conducted. At the commencement of the plenary, Daily Trust observed that only about 30 of the 360-member house were at the chamber, which also continued to diminish as the sitting got underway. The sitting is contrary to Section 54(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), which stipulates that, “The quorum of the Senate or of the House of Representatives shall be one-third of all the members of any of the legislative house concerned.” According to this provision, at least 120 members of the 360 lawmakers are required to form a quorum before a legislative business can be conducted in the House of Representatives. House Leader, Femi Gbajabiamila, expressed concern that although the leadership of the House was aware of the constitutional provision on quorum, the plenary had to proceed because of the events of the previous day. Hon Gbajabiamila said, “Granted that there is a constitutional provision for a quorum before the conduct of a legislative business, we shall not lose sight of the events of yesterday. Recall that protesting National Assembly workers, yesterday, picketed the Senate and the House of Representatives and thus prevented the lawmakers from sitting. Meanwhile, a Member of the House from Anambra State, Gabriel Onyenwife, yesterday, dumped APGA for the PDP. Hon. Onyenwife’s defection was communicated through a letter read by the Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, at the plenary.
