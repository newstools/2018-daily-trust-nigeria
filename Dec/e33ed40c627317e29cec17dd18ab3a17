Unions in the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) have threatened to ground activities in the agency on January 2nd 2019 if their demands for staff promotion were not met. Chairmen of Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN) and National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE ) NCAA branch, Comrades Lucky Izebhokun and Ayodele Sofolayan said the NCAA management had taken the unions for granted on issue of staff promotion despite several appeals. Speaking with newsmen in Lagos, the aggrieved Union chairmen said for over three years, no promotion exercise had taken place in NCAA. Izebhokun who is the Chairman, Joint Action Committee (JAC) said the unions lamented that people were being employed in the name of transfer and secondment from other agencies and outside to occupy managerial positions that would have been occupied by staff if promotion had been carried out. He explained that the NCAA management would be looking for trouble if staff promotion was not carried out before the end of this year. He threatened that the unions would pass a vote of no confidence on the leadership of NCAA come 2nd of January 2019. On his part, Sofolayan, who confirmed that the issue of staff promotion in NCAA was already generating a lot of anxiety said the issue had been delayed for too long. Reacting to the threat by the unions, General Manager, Public Relations, NCAA, Mr, Sam Adurugboye, assured that the management would reach a compromise with the unions soon as they have always been working in harmony.
