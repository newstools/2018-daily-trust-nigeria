A national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has challenged the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Aitku Abubakar, on the Halliburton bribery scandal. Over the years, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been investigating Halliburton, an American multi-national corporation over $182m bribery scandal. Speaking during the National Consultative Forum themed: “Nigeria on the right track” organised by the National Committee of Buhari Support Groups, he said Nigerians have crossed the red ocean and they cannot be taken back to Egypt. “They said we should not talk about the past. We must look at what you have done before. We have to look at the Halliburton issue. Why do they leave Nigeria?  $16billion on NEPA for darkness…When they see that we are kicking them out, they rush to privatise the company, what I call personalisation of the wealth of Nigerians,” he said While commenting on the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, Tinubu said after using the APC to win election in 2015, “Saraki used our mandate to give lifeline to the opposition. Leadership is about character. He left PDP, joined us, got elected and sold our mandate for a pot of porridge. God is honest, Saraki is not.
