The speaker of Yobe State House of assembly, Adamu Dala Dogo, yesterday, resigned at the floor of the House. A source at the house of assembly, however told Daily Trust that the speaker’s resignation was to escape an impending impeachment that had dangled for two days. He said that was the second attempt by members to impeach Dala Dogo, recalling that the first move was shelved following the intervention of Governor Ibrahim Gaidam. “Unfortunately for him, the members had refused to honour Gaidam’s intervention this time around; that is why he took the path of honour and helplessly resigned,” he said. One of the members accused the former speaker of making them a rubber stamp. “Under his leadership, we only served the wish of the executive, and even at that, he made sure that some of the members were victimised. In fact there were lots of compromises to the detriment of members and this honourable house,” he said. A source close to the government house in Damaturu confided in Daily Trust that Governor Gaidam had tried to intervene but the members insisted that they would only give him a soft landing to resign or risk being impeached. The Deputy Speaker, Dr. Ibrahim Garba Kurmi, while reading the speaker’s resignation letter said it was a voluntarily decision based on personal issues and therefore declared the seat vacant. The members unanimously accepted Dogo’s resignation after it was put to vote, and Ibrahim Buba Kalallawa moved a fresh motion for the nomination of Zannah Ali Machina as the new speaker. The motion was seconded by Ishaku Daya and subsequently, Machina accepted the nomination and was thereafter sworn in as the new speaker by the deputy speaker.
