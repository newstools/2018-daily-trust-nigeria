President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated that he is committed to the implementation of the new minimum wage of N30,000 for Nigerian workers. He however, added that his government must approach such implementation with caution so that it does not lead to increased borrowing. Buhari stated this Wednesday during the formal presentation of the 2019 Budget Proposal of N8.7 trillion before a joint session of the National Assembly. “Let me say I am committed to the new minimum wage. But we have to be cautious so that the implementation does not lead to increased borrowing,” the president declared. He further stated that technical committees would be set up to map out ways to ensure that the new wage was effected as soon as possible.
