Campaigners have accused the UK’s Home Office of a lack of “decency” after it emerged “no specific attempt” had been made to approach 49 people deported to Ghana and Nigeria in 2017. They were deported before the Windrush scandal erupted – which revealed people from Commonwealth countries who had legally lived in Britain for decades were wrongly classed as illegal immigrants and deported. Following parliamentary questions from Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, Home Office ministers now admit there are 49 people who have still not been informed by the government that a task force exists to deal with the scandal. The Home Office says it is up to Commonwealth citizens to seek information about their status. MPs said it showed the government had learned nothing from the scandal.
