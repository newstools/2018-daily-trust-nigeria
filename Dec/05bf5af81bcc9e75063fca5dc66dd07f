President Muhammadu Buhari has denied the allegation of cabals’ involvement in his government, saying his wife, Aisha Buhari, should provide evidence to support her claim. He disclosed this in an interview with the Voice of America (VoA), Hausa. The President’s wife, during an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Hausa Services earlier, had alleged that her husband’s government was being run by a cabal. “The President does not know 45 out of 50 of the people he appointed and I don’t know them either, despite being his wife of 27 years. “Some people are sitting down in their homes folding their arms only for them to be called to come and head an agency or a ministerial position,” she had said. However, in his response to the wife’s allegation, the President dismissed the claim saying “I challenge those alleging to show single evidence.” Buhari was featured in a promo video released by the VOA Hausa Service. The President was shown having an interview with the head of the media (Hausa service ) of the Washington base news medium, Aliyu Mustapha Sokoto, who sought for his response over the allegation. The journalist had asked Mr. President: “let me used this opportunity to asked for your reaction on a widely published report about the cabal allegation. You may have heard it yourself. Even, your wife made the allegation recently.” In his quick response, Buhari calmly said: “That is her concern, and this has shown the level of my democratic trait that anyone is free to express his own opinion. “But expressing an opinion is different from reality; let them show a single thing that the cabal have organised and forced me to execute.” Daily Trust reports that the full interview is yet to be released by the VOA Hausa. It learnt that what was released earlier on social media, was just a promo from the media house whose listeners cut across all West African states and other areas where Hausa people live.
