The feud between two factions of the PDP in Borno State worsened, yesterday, with each claiming it fielded the right candidates for the 2019 elections. Alhaji Usman Mahdi Badeiri and Alhaji Zanna Gaddama lead each of the two factions even as they have been in court for many months to assert their legitimacy. Each of the factions has its own set of candidates for gubernatorial, national and state assembly elections. The candidates for the Badeiri-led faction included Mohammed Wakil for governorship; Bukar Kachallah (Senate, Borno Central); Barr. Major Ngada (Borno South); and Mohammed Ali Jajari (Borno North). “We reject the so-called governorship candidate of the Gaddama-led faction, Alhaji Mohammed Imam,” Usman Badeiri, flanked by his factional exco and members, told a news conference, yesterday, in Maiduguri. “We reject the so-called three senatorial candidates including Isa Lawan Kangar for Borno North, Senator Mohammed Abba Aji for Borno Central and Haske Kudla Satumari for Southern Borno,” Badeiri said. In a telephone response, Zanna Gaddama said, “My candidates are the legitimate ones for the 2019 elections because the Federal High Court in Maiduguri, had  on Wednesday, December 12, dismissed the suit filed by Badeiri and reaffirmed the candidature of our candidates.” Badeiri had earlier said they had appealed the judgement.
