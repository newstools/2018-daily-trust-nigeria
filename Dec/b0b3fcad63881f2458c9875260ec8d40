The APC in Katsina State is in disarray and needs urgent intervention, the chairman of Concerned APC Members Forum, Aliyu Muhammad, has said. Muhammad, at a press conference in Katsina, said the attention of the national leadership of the APC must be drawn to the political development of the state. “The APC in Katsina is in serious disarray as a result of the faction created by a member from Funtua Senatorial District, Abubakar Isa, who incidentally was one of the gubernatorial candidates in 2015 and lost to the incumbent, Aminu Masari,” he said. “The grudge of the candidate which resulted to his filing a case at the Federal High Court challenging the primary election that produced Aminu Masari is rather unfortunate and is capable of disintegrating the party. “The need for withdrawal of the pending court case filed by Abubakar Isa and genuine reconciliation of the affected parties should be done immediately,” he added. ‎ Two APC guber aspirants kick ahead of primaries in Katsina Akida: Disquiet in Katsina APC over emergence of new faction Buhari’s in-law all out for APC’s guber ticket in Katsina
