Local government retirees in Ekiti State have asked Governor Kayode Fayemi to investigate why they were left out in the November payment of salary and pensions while core civil servants and other pensioners in the state were paid. The retirees under the aegis of Concerned Local Government Pensioners’ Association of Nigeria expressed regrets that despite introducing centralized payment for all pensioners in the state, they were sidelined in the November payment. The Chairman  of the group, Alhaji Quadri Oguntuase and Secretary, Mr. Abiodun Agboola, who spoke with newsmen in Ado Ekiti on Thursday said they found it disheartening that the association’s members were still not paid the November pension in spite of the promise made by the  governor that all pensioners will henceforth be paid centrally. They urged Fayemi to resolve the logjam leading to delay in the payment of November salary and also investigate the mystery behind  the delay and impose appropriate sanctions on workers creating unnecessary bottleneck causing untold hardship to members. Oguntuase expressed sadness that many of their members  who are on drugs could not afford their medicare owing to acute financial problem, urging the governor to meddle in the issue and resolve the delay in the interest of the local government pensioners. Fayemi had, upon assumption of office on October 16, promised to initiative centralized electronic payment to
all pensioners in the state, to remove noticeable delay leading to excruciating pains and hardship on the parts of pensioners. Fayemi urges Fayose to pay salary arrears Unpaid salary: Workers give Ekiti govt strike notice Ekiti NUT defends Fayose on bail-out, assures pensioners of payment
