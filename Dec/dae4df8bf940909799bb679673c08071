A Pakistani anti-corruption court has jailed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for seven years on corruption charges. The court found on Monday the three-time prime minister was unable to prove the source of income for the ownership of a steel mill in Saudi Arabia, Geo News reported. He was acquitted on a separate corruption charge. Sharif was sentenced in July to 10 years in prison by the same court, on charges related to the purchase of upscale apartments in London, after the Supreme Court removed him from power. He was released from prison in September pending an appeal. Sharif has denied all the charges against him and says he is being targeted by the country’s powerful security establishment.
