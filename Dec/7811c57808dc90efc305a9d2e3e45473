Ibadan family heads, popularly called mogajis, have warned the five leading governorship candidates in Oyo State to desist from inducing its members with money. The group disowned some members going around extorting money from the candidates in the name of Ibadan mogajis, saying “What we want for the state is good governance, not monetary inducement.” Spokesman of the group, Wale Oladoja, who stated this in a statement on Monday, in Ibadan, said electing the next governor of the state would be based on fear of God and antecedents. The group had issued a statement last week supporting five candidates among the 37 candidates contesting for the governorship seat of the state. According to the group, the candidates were Akogun Sarafadeen Alli (ZLP), Engr. Seyi Makinde (PDP), Chief Bayo Adelabu (APC), Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala (ADP) and Senator Olufemi Lanlehin (ADC). Oladoja further said in the statement that the group would not do anything against the wish of the people of Ibadan land and the state at large, urging them to exercise their civic right diligently. “We will soon begin to go to their (candidates’) family houses to find out their positive impacts on their relatives. We want to know their pedigree and antecedents. What they have done to better the lives of their people. “We call on the people of Oyo State to cooperate with our members when they get to their family houses; to reveal the truth through whoever is coming to represent their family, so that we can have the best people in government. “We need the support of the media, religious bodies, traditional institutions, and the entire residents of Oyo State in our effort to make the state great again. It is our state and we deserve the best,” he said.
