The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has outlined its expectations from those vying for the presidency in 2019. It said those interested in the office should have an articulate and thorough blueprint that would make the country to be among the comity of great nations. Acting Chairman of ACF, Alhaji Musa Liman Barde, who made the statement while receiving the presidential candidate of Peoples Trust, Gbenga Olawepo Hashim, at the forum’s secretariat in Kaduna, said the candidates must be ready to run issue-based campaigns and refrain from all forms of incitement. He said, “We expect to see genuinely, the very positive and pragmatic policies and measures put in place to fight against corruption, insecurity, impunity, anarchy and a host of other disingenuous activities which, if not effectively contained, would certainly be the bane of our progress and development as a people and one cohesive nation.” Barde said the ACF remained a non-partisan, non-political, non-religious body which tried to promote peace, unity, justice and the rule of law. Earlier, Olawepo had solicited the support of ACF as the foremost socio-political group in the North in his bid to win the 2019 presidential election. 2019: What we expect from presidential candidates – ACF We have not endorsed Buhari’s candidature –ACF Presidency: ‘Why Jonathan  shouldn’t vie in 2011’
