The National Coordinator of the Next Level Project, Umar Waziri Kumo, says the aim of the political campaign group is to galvanise the support enjoyed by President Muhammadu Buhari for his re-election in 2019. He disclosed this at a town hall meeting with members of the Road Transport Employees Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) on the forthcoming 2019 general elections. He said the president had widespread support among the masses in all parts of the country. Specifically, Kumo said the president enjoyed special support from the people of the North East region because of what he has done for them. Kumo who is also a personal assistant to the president added that Mr President had carried out various developmental projects in the region including roads and interventions in agriculture, hence the need for people in the region to support the next level initiative.
