The presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has unveiled his plans for Nigeria before the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), saying he would tackle insecurity in the country. Atiku, a former vice president, said he would also improve power supply, increase the number of women and youths in governance, address the issue of high maternal mortality, economic situation in the country among others. He lampooned the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government saying instead of providing three million jobs yearly as it promised, a total of 11 million jobs had been allegedly lost since 2015. Atiku observed that the private sector and not government should be the highest employer of labour and the main engine of economic growth. Bishop Stephen Adegbite, the Methodist Bishop of Ikeja Diocese and CANâ€™s Director of Mobilization and National Issues said they were impressed with Atiku for being the first to visit them.
