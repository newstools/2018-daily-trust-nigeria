A former Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Abubakar Jibrin Giri, has dumped the ruling APC for the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP). Alhaji Giri, who confirmed his on through telephone to our reporter yesterday, said he left the APC over alleged injustice meted on him and his councillorship aspirants in the primary elections in the council. He alleged that he and his delegates were harassed and prevented from casting votes during the chairmanship and councillorship primaries in the area, saying he filed a petition to the party  at the FCT level and nothing was done about it. Giri said he was now contesting for the chairmanship of the council on the platform of the SDP alongside his councillorship aspirants in 2019. “I want to confirm to you that I have formerly defected from APC to SDP alongside all my councillorship aspirants from the 10 wards, and I am the chairmanship flag-bearer of the SDP in Gwagwalada Area Council in next year’s council elections,” he said. Reacting, the Gwagwalada chapter chairman of APC, Alhaji Hussein Deze, confirmed the defection of the former chairman to SDP, saying he was surprised when he heard about the defection of the former chairman.
