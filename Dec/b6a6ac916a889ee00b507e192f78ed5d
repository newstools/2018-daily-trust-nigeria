Presidential candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari and of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, have been cautioned to desist from attacking one another in the course of their campaigns to seek election. An Abuja-based Islamic scholar Sheikh Abubakar Sadeeq Shaibu made the admonition at a Maulud celebration yesterday in Abuja. He said it was embarrassing for the two leaders to be seen to be attacking each other while they engaged in campaigns for the 2019 presidential elections. The cleric advised both candidates to rather cooperate with one another, adding that “it is very shameful for them to be seen to be attacking one another.” According to him, “leadership is given by God and to who He so wishes. Whether any one likes it or not, whoever God has destined to win the election, would win, and there was nothing any human being can do about it, because it is what God has destined.” He advised both leaders to exercise maximum control on their aides and followers who sometimes were responsible for some of the actions that heat up the polity, adding that “sometimes these personal assistants and their followers over step their bounds and cause trouble, leading to avoidable violence and destruction of lives and property.”
