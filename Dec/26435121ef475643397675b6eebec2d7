Lagos state governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has revealed that a total of 18 officers of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) died while in active duty just as 24 others have been permanently incapacitated in 2018 alone. Ambode disclosed this on Sunday when he paid a commiseration visit to the LASTMA office in Oshodi, Lagos. An officer of the traffic agency, Rotimi Adeyemo, 41, while in active duty was shot dead by a police officer working with the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) last week in Iyana Ipaja area of Lagos State. The police officer was subsequently mobbed to death by passersby, the police claimed. According to the governor, many of the traffic officers who died in active duty were killed by reckless road users, a development he vowed the state will no longer tolerate.
