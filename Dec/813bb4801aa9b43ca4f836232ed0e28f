The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Imo State, Professor Francis Chukwuemeka Ezeonu, has raised the alarm that some politicians are bent on sabotaging the 2019 general elections by cloning the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in the state. Ezeonu, who spoke in Owerri during the unveiling of the Amalgamation of Imo Professional Bodies and Associations, (AIPA), pleaded with the residents of the state to stop handing over their PVCs to anybody. He alleged that those engaged in the act are working hard to undermine the credibility of the election, stressing that every vote will count in Imo State in 2019. According to him, INEC will be visiting communities in the state during this festive period to make sure that people collect their PVCs pointing out that many residents are reluctant about elections. AIPA chairman, Chief Emeka Diwe, said that the association was working with INEC and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that the elections were credible.
