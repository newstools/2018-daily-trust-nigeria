The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) ranked 84% and has been named the most efficient agency in terms of service delivery and compliance to the Federal Government’s Executive Order 001 around the nation’s airports. The NIS was rated above other agencies like the Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Service which scored 69%, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) with 52%, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) with 47% and the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). This assessment and rating on performance by agencies at the airport was done by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) on the implementation of the Ease of Doing Business, it was learnt. The NIS ranking was also made possible by the Visa on Arrival (VoA) policy which the service has pursued vigorously with 150 VoAs issued to foreigners on a weekly basis. Daily Trust further gathered that the MMIA Command has gotten the comptroller general’s approval for the expansion of both D and E fingers Visa on arrival space. An immigration source confirmed that the expansion of the VoA desks has further deepened the ease of doing business programme. But a source disclosed that some foreigners lacked understanding of the workings of the VoA policy resorting in some of them being turned back. The source explained that most people do not wait for the comptroller general’s approval of their entry visas before they start coming into the country, emphasising that payment did not mean approval.  38,000 'visas on arrival' issued at Lagos airport in one year 38,000 ‘visas on arrival’ issued at Lagos airport 278 foreigners sent back from Lagos airport over visa
