The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) has accused the federal government of failing to bring the attackers of its members during a peaceful protest in Abuja to justice. The IMN claimed that about 50 of its members were killed in Abuja by joint security forces comprising the army and mobile police during the 2018 Arba’een Trek in October. In a statement signed by S.I. Ahmad of the Academic Forum of IMN, the sect also pleaded with the international community to rise against alleged tyranny by the government. “This is among the worst atrocities that have ever happened in the history of Nigeria as a country where government killed its own armless citizens. “Peaceful protest is the right of all citizens, freedom of speech, freedom of religion are all integral parts of democracy. Why is the Nigerian Government under Muhammadu Buhari neglecting all these?” he said. The IMN also called for the immediate release of its leader, Ibrahim Zakzaky, who has been held in detention since December 2015 when the Nigerian Army clashed with the group in Zaria, Kaduna state.
