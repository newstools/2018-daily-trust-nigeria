The Chief Imam of Ansar-Ud-Deen Mosque, Maitama, Abuja, Dr Musa Olaofe, has urged the different ethnic groups in the country to tolerate and show mutual respect for one another. The cleric, who spoke as guest lecturer at Toastline Magazine lecture/awards yesterday in Abuja, said there was need for tolerance and reconciliation in the polity to achieve national cohesion and development. He spoke on the topic, ‘The Teeth Bites the Tongue, Yet They Live in the Same Mouth’, urging Nigerians to respect and cherish their diversity. “Today, if Nigerians irrespective of regions and religions imbibe this philosophy and work assiduously towards reconciliation and understanding of our differences as a people and leverage on our diversity, we would be able to build a country dreamed of by our forefathers and generations yet unborn will be proud of our achievements,” he said. Olaofe also urged politicians to go about their campaigns peacefully and avoid sowing seeds of discord amongst the people, as according to him, 2019 will come and go but Nigeria will remain. The publisher of the magazine, Dr Akinyele Babarinsa, said the topic was timely and relevant as there was mistrust among ethnic groups in the country.
