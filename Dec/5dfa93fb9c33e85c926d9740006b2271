The MD/CEO of Jewels Leading Lights Academy, Mrs Oluwatoyin Oboh, has urged residents to give to orphans and the less privileged in the society as they go about enjoying the festivities. Mrs Oboh who spoke on Saturday at the Christmas fiesta organised by the school, said all children should have equal opportunities irrespective of their background or status. She said not having a parent is no fault of the children. “We want them to have same opportunities as others and enjoy the season. It takes a village to raise  a child because among them there are presidents; because their destinies are not restricted to where they have found themselves as at now. So why don’t we be part of their journey so that when they succeed they will remember those that played a role,” she said. She said the school had given scholarships to over 50 orphans to prepare them for the future. On the Christmas fiesta, she said it was to show the children our much they were loved. “There is nothing that makes me happy than seeing smiles on their faces; there is no amount of reward that can be equivalent to seeing them smile,” she said.
