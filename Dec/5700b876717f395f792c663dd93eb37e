Many were dead, just as dozens sustained various degrees of injuries when suspected Boko Haram insurgents engaged troops of the Nigerian Army in a gun duel at Rann in Kala-Balge local government area of Borno state, a source said on Thursday. The incident occurred at 8:30pm today when the insurgents attacked the council headquarters located in Rann, shooting sporadically. According to an aid worker, the Armed Forces Special Force stations in Rann responded swiftly and engaged the attackers which led to the killing of many of the insurgents while their vehicles were damaged. “They came to attack Rann this evening, there was confusion everywhere but after an hour, the shooting subsided. The Special Forces on ground responded appropriately, many of the insurgents fighters were killed but some civilians may have equally lost their lives too. “The casualties figure can’t be ascertained tonight but some the attackers’ vehicles were damaged and abandoned,” he told our correspondent on phone. It will be recalled that the insurgents attacked Rann early March this year when humanitarian workers were killed and three others abducted.
