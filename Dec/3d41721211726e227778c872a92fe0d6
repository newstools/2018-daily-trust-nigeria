President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed great sadness at the news of the passing away of the first executive president of the country. He said, “On behalf of my family, the government and the people of Nigeria, it is with immense sadness that I received the news of the passing away of the first executive president of Nigeria, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, which event happened Friday in Abuja.” The president, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, described the death as the departure of a patriot whose life of service and humility was widely acknowledged. Buhari recalled part of the birthday message he sent to Shagari last February when he said, “We are enthralled and regaled with the many years of unequalled patriotism, sacrifices and contributions to national development. More specifically, we celebrate the role-modelling qualities of integrity, diligence and humility that have been the hallmark of your visionary leadership.” President Buhari is however, grateful to God that Alhaji Shagari lived to a ripe old age and led an exemplary life, which he urges Nigerians of all walks of life to emulate. “Nigerians held him in the highest esteem even when he was out of office until his demise and will forever miss his wise counsel,” he said. He also prayed that Almighty God will comfort the family of the ex-president and all those who mourn him and will grant the soul of the late nonagenarian eternal rest.
