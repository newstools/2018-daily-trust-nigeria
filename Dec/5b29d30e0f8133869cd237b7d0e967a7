Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa State and Chairman, APC Peace and Reconciliation Committee, North East, says his team received over 350 presentations from aggrieved party members from the zone. Al-Makura said this, yesterday, while fielding questions from journalists shortly after submitting the report of his committee to the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led APC National Working Committee (NWC) at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. The governor, who declined to reveal the recommendations of his committee, said the suggestions made focused on critical issues that would guarantee victories for the party. He expressed confidence that no member would consider leaving the party from the responses they received as the party members in the zone were ‘highly committed, faithful and loyal’, and re-affirmed that APC would sweep the polls in 2019. “Particularly, our President has received tremendous amount of accolades across the states we went to in the zone in spite of complaints they had. I can assure you that Buhari will win this election hands-down in the North-east,” he added. In his response during the presentation, the APC National Chairman, Comrade Oshiomhole, promised the Al-Makura-led committee that the party would act as quickly as possible on the recommendations made after studying the report. Oshiomhole urged the aggrieved to learn from President Muhammadu Buhari who lost three consecutive elections before he eventually won in 2015. He said the APC was leading by example as it allowed people to contest against the sitting governor which resulted to the loss of Governor Akinwumi Ambode at the primary election in Lagos State. He voiced confidence that the party would win again in 2019, following the reconciliation move.
