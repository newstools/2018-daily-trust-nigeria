The Proprietress of Vantage Point Academy, Gwarimpa, Abuja, Mrs. Marie Davids, has called on parents to be involved in the upbringing and educational development of their children. Speaking during the school’s 2018 end of the year party at the weekend, Mrs. Davids noted that it was not enough for parents to leave everything about their children to the school, adding that they must ensure that the school their children attended was up to standard. “Parents should be involved in the education and upbringing of their children. So, when you have a child in a school, it is not enough to leave everything about the child to the school. The parents have a role to play in ensuring that the school your child is attending is up to standard,” she said. She also called on government to provide enabling environment and strong policies that would encourage innovation in private schools in the country. She also made case for scholarship programmes for highly gifted Nigerian children to give them the enabling environment to improve themselves, adding that government agencies in the education sector should be restructured so that they could work closely with the schools in finding such talents.
