A former Chief of Staff to Imo State Governor, Uche Nwosu, yesterday, formally defected from the APC to the Action Alliance (AA), which was registered by Gov. Rochas Okorocha, to pursue his gubernatorial ambition. Nwosu, who is Okorocha’s son-in-law, said despite the injustice meted out to him by the APC and its leadership led by Adams Oshiomhole, he was confident of winning the Imo governorship contest in 2019. Supported by officials of AA, Nwosu said the entire APC structure, except those supporting the senatorial ambition of Gov. Okorocha, had dissolved into AA. He described AA as a party with the ideal democratic manifesto, stressing that his ambition to succeed Okorocha was driven by the massive support he enjoyed from the over 70 per cent of the electorate in Imo State. Speaking with newsmen at the Sam Mbakwe International Airport shortly on arrival from Abuja, Nwosu said he was forced out of APC because of injustice, impunity and lack of respect for the party’s constitution. Waving the flag of the new party as he alighted from the aircraft, Nwosu was welcomed by hundreds of supporters. He said AA would cooperate with APC to deliver President Muhammadu Buhari and Gov. Okorocha as president and senator respectively.
