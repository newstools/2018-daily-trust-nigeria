Ahead of the Christmas and New Year festivities, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has beefed up security at all airports in the country especially the international gateways in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt. This is to ensure that the security of the airports is not compromised due to the expected surge in passengers’ movement during the yuletide. The spokesperson of FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, in a statement on Friday assured air travellers and other airport users that the network of airports across the country are fully prepared for the usual surge in passenger traffic during the festive season. “In preparation for the season and beyond, we have beefed up security at all airports, especially the major international gateways in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Kano”, it said. The authority also said it is improving on its facilities and infrastructure “to ensure maximum comfort for all airport users.” Yakubu noted that a brand new international terminal was commissioned for use at the Port Harcourt International Airport, adding that a similar facility was also commissioned in Abuja on Thursday. All the upgrade in infrastructure, she reiterated, were geared towards improving facilitation of passengers. The agency however appealed to passengers to get to the airports early to conclude all check-in procedures in good time, so as to avoid the experience of missing their flights. “This is important because of the heavy passenger traffic that is usually the experience around this time and also due to ongoing construction works around the Lagos and Abuja airports”, it added.
