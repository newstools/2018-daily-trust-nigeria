The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, has ordered a full scale investigation into an alleged attack on an actor identified as Gideon Okeke. The video of the actor complaining of an alleged attack against him by some policemen attached to the Maroko Division, Lagos, had gone viral on the social media. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, who confirmed the development, said that Edgal’s attention was drawn to a video on the Instablog9ja in which Okeke was seen alleging that some policemen brutalised him after a minor road accident involving him and one Mrs Mosunmola Ilori. “The CP assures that nothing will be swept under the carpet and urged all parties in the matter to fully cooperate with the investigators.
