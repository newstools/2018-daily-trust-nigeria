Federal Capital Territory (FCT) residents have been urged to be security conscious and report any suspicious movement to security agencies. The State Secretary of the All Progressives Party (APC) in FCT, Hashimu Angama, who made the call assured residents that the government would continue to work in concert with the security agencies in ensuring the safety of lives and property. “I want to use this season of love to express my gratitude to FCT residents, particularly all the members of the APC for their prayers as well as their sacrifices towards the success of the last FCT APC primaries,” he said. He also called on residents not to stop praying for 2019 elections to be peaceful adding that they should join hands to make the FCT, the centre of unity and a haven of peace as was planned by the founding fathers. According to Angama, all Nigerians, particularly the Christian faithful should also use the Christmas season to pray for political leaders and Nigeria.
