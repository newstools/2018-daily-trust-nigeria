The Uba Sani Empowerment Foundation for the Underprivileged (USEFUL) has trained 520 people as part of the organization’s empowerment drive for youth and women’s economic self-reliance. Participants at the 5-day programme acquired the basic skills in vocational training, ranging from tailoring, photography, shoemaking, embroidery to IT skills among others. The graduates received their respective certificates and other necessary financial supports on th 6th day of the training. The Chairman of the foundation, Malam Uba Sani, during the flag-off of the training, had said the foundation made adequate provisions in order to ensure that participants enjoy a conducive atmosphere for the training. A statement from the foundation indicated that the training was one of the many in the series lined-up for empowering the less privileged members of the society. The statement indicated that the latest graduation was also part of a comprehensive framework designed by USEFUL, with the technical support of its partners, for rescuing citizens in need while adding that the primary goal of the latest effort was to bridge the gaps with market-driven technical job skills and knowledge of the economy that will enable young people excel in the society. The programme had its roots in a partnership between the trio of Uba Sani Foundation for the Underprivileged, Magvoile Vocation Center and Hasken Arewa (Light Up Arewa). The successful graduands expressed gratitude to the Uba Sani Foundation and its partners for coming to their rescue at a critical point in the history of the nation, saying few privileged Nigerians have the courage to rebuild the lives of fellow citizens.
