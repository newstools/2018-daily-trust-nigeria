There are indications that former Chief of Staff to Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State, Uche Nwosu, may be running for the 2019 Imo governorship race under the Action Alliance (AA). This may put an end to all speculations as to his next line of action after his former party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) refused to submit his name as the party’s flag-bearer for the election. Our correspondent reports that Nwosu’s posters started flooding Owerri, Imo State capital, yesterday even before a formal declaration, thus beating the December 2 deadline for the substitution of candidate’s name by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). It will be recalled that AA was founded by Okorocha before he dumped it for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and later joined the APC. The final list of parties’ candidates will be made known January 31, Daily Trust learnt.
