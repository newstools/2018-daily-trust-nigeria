The Senator representing Ogun East, Buruji Kashamu, yesterday, said the national leadership of the PDP cannot be stronger than the judiciary and God. Sen. Kashamu was reacting to a statement credited to the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, that Ladipopu Adebutu remained the official gubernatorial candidate of the party in Ogun State. Our correspondent recalls that INEC had accepted and recognised the candidates’ list submitted by the Kashamu-backed PDP in Ogun, which is chaired by Bayo Dayo, against the list submitted by the Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC). In the list recognised by INEC, Adeleke Shittu, who was the governorship candidate, had withdrawn from the race for Kashamu as the party’s flag-bearer. However, Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Wednesday, reportedly said the clarification “puts to rest all controversies, uncertainties and misgivings regarding the authentic governorship candidate of the PDP in Ogun State.” In a swift reaction, Kashamu said Ologbondiyan’s position “smacks of ignorance of the extant provisions of the party’s constitution and also in utter disregard of court judgements on the matter.” In the statement, made available to our correspondent by Kashamu’s Media Aide, Austin Oniyokor, he further said the party’s stance conveyed by the publicist “is clearly contemptuous and in clear violation of valid and subsisting court pronouncements.”
