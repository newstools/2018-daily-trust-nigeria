The death toll from a suicide bombing targeting a security forces convoy outside Kabul jumped to 12, officials said, with eight civilians killed in the latest Taliban-claimed attack near the Afghan capital. The blast took place in Paghman district in western Kabul early on Tuesday as the vehicles returned from an overnight operation, the interior ministry said. “Twelve people including four members of the security forces were killed,” ministry of interior deputy spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said. Attacks on Afghan forces by the Taliban have inflicted record-high casualties on security personnel this year. The early morning attack in Kabul came hours after an overnight assault by Taliban fighters on a checkpoint in Arghistan, a district in southern Kandahar province. At least eight police officers were killed, according to the provincial media office.
