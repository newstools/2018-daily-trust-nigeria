Two members of a suspected gang of kidnappers have been arrested by a combined team of security agencies in Ondo State. The suspects, whose names were given as 42-year- old Alhassan Saleh from Nasarawa State and 24- year-old Yahaya Yakubu from Kano State, were arrested by a team of policemen led by the Ondo State Commissioner of Police, Mr Olugbenga Adeyanju, and the Deputy Commissioner of Police for the state in charge of Operations, Abdullahi Mudashiru, assisted by soldiers from the 32 Artillery Brigade in Akure. The spokesman for the Ondo State police command, Femi Joseph, said the police embarked on massive raids of suspected hideouts of the criminals, especially in the forest where they had operated from. Joseph said the police massively raided the thick forest and adjoining bushes of Amorin and Uso communities in Owo. Some of the suspects, he added, fled on sighting the police. An AK 47 rifle was said to have been recovered from the two suspects arrested. Also in Ore, a suspected kidnapper was said to have been killed in a similar operation by the Anti- Kidnapping section of the state command in his attempt to kidnap two men. Joseph said a quick response from the police foiled the kidnap operation. It would be recalled that more than 15 persons had been kidnapped within one month in the state. The kidnappers killed one of their victims, a lecturer at the state-owned polytechnic.
