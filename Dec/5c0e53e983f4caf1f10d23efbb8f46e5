A former governor of Niger State, Dr Muazu Babaginda Aliyu, has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of planning to rig the 2019 elections. Speaking during the flag-off campaign of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Malam Umar Nasko ahead of the 2019 elections, the former governor alleged that the ruling party aimed to use the security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to rig the poll. He urged the people to guide against truncating their will by protecting their votes and resisting any form of intimidation during the exercise, even as he urged  the electorates in the state to vote out the ruling party. He said the APC administration in the state has failed to provide the dividends of democracy to the people, adding that the party does not deserve a return. In his speech at the occasion, the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Nasko promised that his administration would embark on massive infrastructural development across the state if elected. He said among the projects his administration would accord priority is the dualization of Bida- Minna road, even as he promised to return free education policy without discrimination. The state chairman of the party, Barrister Tanko Beji, presented the party’s flags to its candidate for Niger South senatorial district, Alhaji Baba Shehu Agaie, three House of Representatives members and State Assembly members ahead of the 2019 elections.
