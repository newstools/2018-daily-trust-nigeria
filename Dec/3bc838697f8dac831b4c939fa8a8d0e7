Relatives of the slain former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh in Vintim village in Mubi North area have been devastated by his gruesome murder. Vintim village located six kilometers from Mubi town wore a mournful mood on Wednesday as some relatives and kinsmen gathered at the house of the deceased to mourn him. The village is predominantly inhabited by Fali ethnic group. A relative of Badeh, Philemon Vintim said the nation had lost an icon and a man of peace who spent his productive life working to keep Nigeria peaceful. He lamented that the loss of the retired general would open gaps in Mubi area in view of his commitment to ensure peaceful coexistence in the area. A cousin of the deceased Baba Sylvester, who looked devastated, declined comment, saying he decided not to talk to media in the next few days. The chairman of Fali Cultural and Community Development Association (FACCODA), John P. Kaigama said the death of Badeh had devastated the entire members of Fali tribe and residents of the village. He said the deceased being a Fali man who reached the zenith of military career was regarded as a hero in the community, his brutal murder therefore affected the community in many ways. Meanwhile, Governor Muhammadu Jibrilla has called on security agencies to fish out killers of the slain general and make them face justice. In a press statement by his Special Assistant, Press and Media, Martins Dickson, the governor described Badeh as a patriot who contributed immensely to Adamawa State and the country at large during his long military career. Jibrilla extolled the community development spirit exhibited by the late general, saying one of his contribution to the state was the establishment of Air Force Comprehensive School in Yola when he served as the Chief of Air Staff.
