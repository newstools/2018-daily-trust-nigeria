Travellers at different motor parks in Benue State have continued to lament the hike in transport fare despite the availability of fuel in petrol stations across the state. Our correspondent, who visited major motor parks in Makurdi metropolis yesterday, reports that most passengers decried the high cost of transport fare. But some drivers explained that the hike was to cover their losses on return journeys because there were no passengers to convey back to Makurdi metropolis from the various major towns. A passenger at Ejifa park, Blessing Robert, said she paid a sum of N1,200 instead of the usual N600 to travel to Otukpo, one-and-half hours distance from Makurdi, the state capital. Similarly, for those travelling to Gboko, depending on the transport company’s service patronised, they were made to part with as much as N1,000 for an hour trip from Makurdi which used to be N500. Most of the travellers were however happier that this year’s Christmas celebration was without the usual long queues at filing station as they pleaded with transport operators to maintain the regular fare in the interest of the common man.
