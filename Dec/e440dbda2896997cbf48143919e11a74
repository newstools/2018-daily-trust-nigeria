The feud between the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State has taken another dimension with both sides trading accusations of buying Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) from each otherâ€™s strongholds. Speaking at a press conference in Jos, Plateau state PDP Deputy Chairman, Amos Gombi Goyol, said the APC was buying voter cards, especially in the PDP strongholds as part of its plans to win 2019 election at all levels. He said the act could cause a breach of the peace and warned the state government and the APC not to plunge the state into another needless political crisis in their desperation to hold on to power. In a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor Simon Lalong on Media and Publicity, Mark Longyen, said the PDP are the ones planning to buy PVCs for reasons best known to them, adding that they should publish documentary evidence to prove their allegations or simply shut up.
