President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Peoples Congress (APC) have been charged to begin the process to restructure the country to address its fundamental problems. Liberty Movement, which represents over 3000 community based organisations across the country, said restructuring would unlock the untapped potentials in Nigeria. At a press conference in Lagos at the weekend, leader of the movement, Mr Sola Ajayi also disclosed that the group had set up plans to ensure the President secures no fewer than 30 million votes in the next election. According to him, Buhari’s positive posture on restructuring leading to the introduction of the State Police Bill at the National Assembly would boost the chance of the President in the 2019 election. The movement expressed optimism that Buhari and his Vice President are more likely to restructure the country in their second term more than any other Presidential candidate.
