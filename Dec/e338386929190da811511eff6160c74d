The military joint taskforce (JTF) has renewed its war against pipeline vandals who were observed to have returned to their operations in Ikorodu, Epe and the environs in Lagos State. It was learnt that the vandals, who fled from the riverine communities in Lagos and Ogun states to Igbokoda, Ondo State, had again been sighted in Ikorodu, Epe and other riverine areas scooping petroleum products from ruptured pipelines belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The vandals had unleashed a reign of terror in the riverine areas of Lagos and Ogun states for many years until they were dislodged by the joint task force codenamed OPS AWATSE about two years ago. On the renewed onslaught, the Director, Defence Information, Brigadier-General John Agim, said men of the task force had arrested a total of 38 suspects. Gen Agim said that the team also recovered about 120,000 litres of premium motor spirit (petrol) from the vandals. Also seized were nine wooden boats owned by the suspects, which he said were destroyed instantly. The suspects, he said, had been handed over to the appropriate security agencies for further investigation and prosecution.
