The Chairman of Green Energy International Ltd, operator of Otakikpo Marginal field in OML 11, Prof. Anthony Adegbulugbe, has said that the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plant being established at Ikuru town in Rivers State by the company will be ready for installation by the 2nd quarter of 2019. LPG which is popularly called cooking gas is used as a fuel for many residential, commercial and agricultural heat applications, including cooking, hot water systems and heating. Prof. Adegbulugbe, who said this at the first stakeholders’ interactive luncheon in Port Harcourt, added that it was one of the unique projects of the company to ensure zero gas flare in the Niger Delta, under its small scale gas utilization programme. The 12 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) plant for which approval to construct (ATC) was issued  in August, is being constructed in China  at a cost of over $12 million. The chairman said the host communities of the project would enjoy power supply from the company’s 6MW gas-fired generators. Reeling out other plans of the company in its phase 2 development, Adegbulugbe said it had just completed a 3D seismic campaign to understand the field with a view to drilling more wells, while an onshore export terminal was also being proposed to be established by 2020. He said the company, which started production in 2017, was producing 6000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and would ramp up to 20,000 bopd in few years. He said the company and its technical partner Lekoil have patronised local community contractors since its inception with over N3 billion worth of procurement contracts which have contributed to the economic development of the people. ‘How marginal oil field producers can survive hard times’ FG approves LPG extraction plant for Green Energy ‘FG needs aggressive strategy to increase cooking gas consumption’
