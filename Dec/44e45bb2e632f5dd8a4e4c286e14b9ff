Senior lawyers have expressed differing opinions on the feasibility of concluding the process of returning Nigeria to the parliamentary system of government within the time left for the 8th Assembly. The immediate past president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Abubakar Mahmud (SAN) said it would require a major constitutional amendment and that the process was not straightforward, adding that it had to go through all the stages including endorsement by various states’ Houses of Assembly and then returned to the National Assembly before it could be assented to by the president. “If you are going to go through these processes, it looks quite herculean to accomplish it in the timeframe they are talking about. A lot of people have these views that perhaps we have to take another look at the parliamentary system; but it is something that should be debated and discussed and I don’t think it is something that should be rushed,” he said. Another former president of NBA, Chief OCJ Okocha (SAN), said it was not a realistic move by the lawmakers, adding that radical changes had to be made to the constitution. Abdulhakeem Mustapha (SAN) said the timing of the move by the lawmakers begged the question of what they had been doing in the past three years. He, however, added that the lawmakers deserved applause for coming up with the process even though it was a process that cannot be concluded in the present session. However, a Professor of Law, Ernest Ojukwu (SAN), said with the way legislators worked in Nigeria, it would be impossible for them to finish the process in two weeks even if they all agreed. He therefore said the project was a wasteful endeavour. The senior lawyers were however unanimous in their opinions that a change of system could not unilaterally solve the problems confronting the country.
