Seven years after Germany scrapped conscription, its defence chief has said employing EU citizens is “an option” to fill expert posts. Army general inspector Eberhard Zorn said the forces had to “look in all directions in times of a lack of qualified personnel”, such as doctors and IT specialists. The armed forces have been beset by years of under-investment. Germany aims to increase its military by 21,000 personnel by 2025. It has also pledged to raise its defence budget from 1.2% to 1.5% of its gross domestic product by 2024.
