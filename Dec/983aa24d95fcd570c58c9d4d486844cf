The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has appealed to all members of the party in Lagos State to mobilise support from the grassroots and ensure that up to three million votes or more are delivered to the party in the forthcoming  general elections. Tinubu,  a former governor of the State, made the disclosure  at a stakeholders’ convergence held at the party secretariat in Ikeja, Lagos. According to Tinubu, Lagos State has a total of six million votes and it has become expedient that at least the party aims for 50 per cent which is half of six million. He also asked the party members to be resolute and defy antics of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “It is over the 16 years of their failures and empty promises. We, in Lagos, were in opposition at the federal level, we survived them, we make progress. We are today the fifth largest economy in Africa. Lagos has the number; six million solid votes. “I challenge all of you; your target must be 50 per cent of that votes for APC; 50 per cent and above from the entire six million votes. Will you do it for Buhari, for Osinbajo, for senators, House of Representatives, governorship and House of Assembly, chairman, councillors in local government, anytime any day?,” Tinubu said. Similarly, the Lagos State Governor,  Akinwunmi Ambode, urged all aggrieved members of the party to emulate him and forgo past bickerings. Ambode later raised the hands of both the party’s governorship candidate, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and deputy governorship candidate, Obafemi Hamzat as those whom to hand over to when he vacates power in May 2019.
