Arewa Youth Forum on Friday said Zamfara state governor, Abdul’aziz Yari, has failed woefully in tackling insecurity in the state, saying they support the calls to impose State of Emergency on the state. The forum said emergency rule would no doubt serve as solution to the killings of innocent citizens in rural part of the state. The forum’s National Director of Public Affairs, Bello Abdulhamid, disclosed this at a media briefing in Kaduna on Friday‎. He said the governor must step aside to allow the federal government to impose state of  emergency so as to protect the lives of the people of the state. “Zamfara State governor Abdul’azeez Yari seemed to have failed woefully to tackle the insecurity situation in the state which resulted to loss of lives as many people were displaced. “We support imposition of State of Emergency in Zamfara State immediately so that this ugly security threat will be cleaned and full wrath of the law will descend on the criminal elements and personalities involved,” he said He, however, saluted the courage and patriotic sacrifice being made by the gallant men and officers of Nigerian military and other security agencies  in the state.
