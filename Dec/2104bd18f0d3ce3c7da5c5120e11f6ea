The police are most likely to violate human rights, a survey has found. Up to 3 in 10 Nigerians say police violated their rights, according to a survey by NOIPolls to mark World Human Rights Day. The government and other security officials come second and third human rights violators respectively for a combined 29% of Nigerians. The right most violated is “dignity of human person.” At least 22 in 100 respondents in the survey cited their right to dignity of human person violated. The next most violated right is “freedom of movement” and “compensation for property compulsorily acquired”. NOIPolls conducted the survey in 2016 and says its findings are still as valid as two years ago. “Despite the efforts to protect it, hostility toward human rights and those who defend it continues to rise,” it said. “As a result, this year’s Human Rights Day advocates for everyone to stand up for their rights and those of others – civil, economic, political and cultural rights.” ‘Human rights abuse victims lack confidence in judiciary’ Human Rights Commission sensitises market women Fundamental human rights violation
