The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, says the party is now more stronger in Imo and Ogun States despite the tacit support Governors Ibikunle Amosun and Rochas Okorocha gave to their preferred governorship candidates to run on the platforms of other political parties. Oshiomhole, who said this after receiving APC women leaders from Edo State and Abuja who paid him a solidarity visit in his office in Aso drive, Abuja, said the two governors were poor students of their own political history.
Oshiomhole, who said the party would look into their action to determine whether its rules had been breached, stressed that the electorate had the real sanction against them. He expressed happiness over the positive outcome of the efforts of the Peace and Reconciliation Committee in some places.
