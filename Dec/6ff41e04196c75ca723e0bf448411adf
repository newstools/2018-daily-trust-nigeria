The Interfaith Dialogue for Peace (IDFP ) on Monday trained 30 Muslim and Christian Organization’s leaders on peace ahead of 2019 General Election in Kaduna State. The co-chairman of the organization Mohammed Mohammed  said the training was important because youths were the major component of peace in any society. “Kaduna has witnessed violence in the past more than any other state in the country, so we chose Kaduna youth for the training because it is a flashpoint as far as election violence is concerned,’’ he said. He said records have shown that about 800 lives were lost in  violence  after the 2011 elections in the state. In their separate remarks both State Secretary of the  Christian Association of Nigeria, Sunday Ibrahim and his  Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) counterpart, Ibrahim Kufena, called for peaceful election in the country.
