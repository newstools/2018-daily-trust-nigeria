The Hungarian parliament has approved amendments to the labour law proposed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s party which critics call a “slave law” that only benefits employers. Members of Hungary’s opposition parties on Wednesday resorted to whistling and blocking the speaker’s podium in an attempt to prevent the amendment, which would dramatically increase total overtime hours. However, the rare scenes of chaos in Hungarian parliament could not prevent the passing of the amendment by a 130-52 vote secured by the ruling, right-wing Fidesz party. The amendment, proposed last month, hikes the maximum annual overtime hours that employers can require from 250 to 400 hours. It also triples the time period for calculating overtime payments to three years.
