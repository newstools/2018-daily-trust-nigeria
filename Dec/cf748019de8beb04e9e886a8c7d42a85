Suspected Boko Haram insurgents burnt three primary schools and a military facility within two days in Yobe State. The schools were destroyed in two separate attacks that took place on December 24 and 26 in Kuka-reta and Katarko towns, 20 kilometre radius of Damaturu, the state capital. The schools are Kuka-reta Primary School, Katarko Primary School and Ngaurawa Primary School where hundreds of internally displaced children are currently schooling. The village head of Kuka-reta, Lawani Babagana, said Kuka-reta Primary School, undergoing expansion, was accommodating displaced pupils whose parents decided to settle in the village. “We don’t know how it would be when the students resume from vacation,” he said. A resident, Alhaji Muhammad Goni, said repeated attacks had forced many residents to flee to Damaturu and other parts of the state.
