The Edo State House of Assembly candidate of the Nigeria Peoples Congress (NPC), Princess Vivian Eweka, has lamented what she describes as the marginalisation of women in Nigerian politics. Princess Eweka, who spoke at the weekend while flagging off her campaign in Ologbo, Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area, said women had not been given the opportunity to express themselves since 1999. She said she was in politics to set the pace for other women to follow. On his part, the party’s state chairman, Elder Godfrey Ehimhen Ehizokhale, expressed confidence in the candidature of the party’s flag bearer, saying she  has all it takes to bring  development to the community.
