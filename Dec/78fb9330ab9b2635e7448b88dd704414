Made in Nigeria for Exports Project (Project MINE) is expected to boost manufacturing export by $30 billion yearly by 2025. A statement from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, said the project is aimed at aiding structural transformation of the Nigerian economy by increasing the manufacturing sector’s contribution to Gross Domestic Product to 20 per cent by 2025 and contributing to sustainable inclusive growth by creating 1.5 million new manufacturing jobs in the initial phase of the project. The project, promoted by the ministry, is expected to create local models of global best practice in provision of world class infrastructure at competitive costs connecting SEZs to international and regional markets with transport links, uninterrupted power, ICT, water, sewage and other services to ensure smooth and efficient operation of SEZ businesses.  The ministry said it is aimed at promoting the “cluster” effect to be gained by locating similar export-oriented manufacturing businesses within the same locality; attracting world class investors with strong positions in global supply chains and investors with potential to increase the scale of operations rapidly to set up operations in SEZs. It is also to create an enabling environment for SEZ businesses by instituting best in class legal and regulatory frameworks, using technology and streamlined processes to facilitate movement of people, goods and capital and easy access to government services, approvals and permits.
