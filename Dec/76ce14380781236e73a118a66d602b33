The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has unveiled his plans for Nigeria before the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), saying he would tackle insecurity in the country. Atiku, a former Vice President, said he would also improve power supply, increase the number of women and youth in governance, address the issue of high maternal mortality and economic situation in the country, among others. He lampooned the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government saying instead of providing three million jobs yearly as it promised, a total of 11 million jobs have been allegedly lost since assumption of office in 2015. Atiku observed that the private sector and not government, should be the highest employer of labour and the main engine of economic growth. “You have made history today by being the first presidential candidate to honour our invitation and we do not take it for granted,” Bishop Stephen Adegbite, the Methodist Bishop of Ikeja Diocese and CAN Director of Mobilization and National Issues said. Others at the occasion were Bishop Anthony Anyiador, National Treasurer for CAN; Director of Youths, Engr. Abiodun Sanyaolu; Chaplain, National Christian Centre, Bishop Peter Ogunmuyiwa; Acting General Secretary of CAN, Barr. Joseph Daramola; National Coordinator for 2019 elections for CAN, Dr. William Okoye and Chief Kenny Martins, among others.
