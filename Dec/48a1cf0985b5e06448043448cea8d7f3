The Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Local Content have endorsed  the $48 million pipe coating plants of Solewant Group as standard model under the Nigerian Content Oil and Gas Industry Content Development ( NOGICD) Act for  domestication work. The NOGICD Act signed by former President Goodluck Jonathan on April 22, 2010  is designed to enhance the level of participation of Nigerians and Nigerian companies in the country’s oil and gas industry. Chairman Senate Committee on Local Content, Sen Adeola Olamilekan Solomon, who led the delegation during the visit, in a statement, said the National Assembly committee in the Senate and House of Representatives are satisfied with the standard of facilities at the pipe coating plant. He noted during the visit to the plant  that the tour has helped to confirm the  competence of  Solewant Group as an indigenous  company that it’s  truly 100 per cent Nigerian content compliant and not a commissioned agent. “With the  huge investment in modern facilities under local content requirement in each plant visited and local manpower, the  assurance we are giving to them today is  that we are with them all the way,” the Local Content Committee chairman assured. The senator, however, called for government’s support for the company to sustain service delivery considering huge investment in anti-corrosion plant with over 250 Nigerian staff fully skilled in its employment.
