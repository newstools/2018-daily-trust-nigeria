The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State, Senator John Owan-Enoh, has  presented a four-year economic development plan from 2019-2023 for the state which would guide him if he wins the election. Owan-Enoh said the plan was anchored on the vision of “making Cross River State the preferred investment destination in West Africa.” He disclosed a four-point agenda with a mission statement “to enable the industrialisation of the state, underpinned by a secure environment, critical infrastructure and efficient human capital.” He disclosed the variables that will facilitate the execution of the EDM, which he called “enablers.” The enablers, according to him, would include collaborations with the Federal Government, development planners, research organisations, organised private sector, local governments and civil service reforms, prudent financial management and budget alignment.
