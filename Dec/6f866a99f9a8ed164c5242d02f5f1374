The senator representing Okigwe zone, Ben Uwajumogu, has assured President Muhammadu Buhari of getting the larger percentage of the votes from the southeast in the 2019 elections. Speaking while flagging off a 6.5 km road project at Ihim in Isiala Mbano local government areas of Imo state, Uwajumogu said the president has done enough for the people of the zone adding that the only way to pay him back is to ensure that he is re-elected for a second term in 2019. The senator, who is also seeking a re-election, said the project is one of three road projects to be constructed in the area by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). While commending an illustrious son of the area, Sir Tony Chukwu, for being the pillar of development in Mbano, Uwajumogu urged the people to re-elect him and Buhari so that the good works can continue. Also speaking, the traditional ruler of Ihim autonomous community, His Royal Majesty, Eze Gburugburu, Oliver Ohanwe, said he and the traditional rulers from Okigwe zone were the first traditional rulers to endorse Buhari for a second term. He reiterated his commitment to ensure that the dream comes true.
