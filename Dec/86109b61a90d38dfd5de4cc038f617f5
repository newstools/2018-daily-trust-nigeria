A Non-Governmental Organisation, Dukes Transnational Care Initiative, has donated three sewing machines and foodstuff to Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs in Durumi, Abuja. While delivering the gifts, the programme coordinator of the organisation, Regina Korinjoh, said the gesture was part of the NGO’s contribution to the welfare of IDPs. Korinjoh said the NGO was into the development of vulnerable persons in the society, especially women and children, adding that the sewing machines were donated to help women in the camp become less dependent on handouts. “We are not just into donation of gifts, we also help vulnerable persons to develop their capacity through training programmes. Some of these women have received training in fashion designing. “So, we are donating these sewing machine for them to start working to sustain themselves,” she said. Korinjoh, who said measures had been put in place to monitor the usage of the items, also expressed confidence that the administrative structure in the camp would help to ensure that the equipment were kept safe. One of the beneficiaries, Hajara Suleiman, said the sewing machine she got would help sustain her family. “I have six children and this sewing machine will help me to provide for my family,” she said. The women leader of the camp, Liyatu Ayuba, while commending the NGO for remembering them during the Christmas celebration, also called on other Nigerians to extend same gestures to them during this period. “We thank the NGO for these gifts of foodstuff and sewing machines but these foodstuff is not enough. We are many here, 2740 people are here and we will appreciate more gifts in this period”, she noted.
