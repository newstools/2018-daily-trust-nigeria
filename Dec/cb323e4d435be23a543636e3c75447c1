The comptroller of the Nigerian Immigration Service, Enugu State Command, Sam  Chinda, has asked all foreigners in the state to surrender their Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs) as they are not expected to participate in the 2019 general elections. He also asked them, particularly those from other West African nations living in the state, to register officially with their various town unions and immigration offices for proper identification. He said they should not allow themselves to be used by politicians to cause confusion and violence  during the elections. Chinda spoke in Enugu yesterday at a meeting with leaders of non-Nigerians drawn from the 17 local government areas of the state. According to him, in the Immigration Act, anybody coming to stay up to 56 days in Nigeria ought to register with the Immigration. “Registration is free; we are not supposed to collect any money from you. All we want is for you to come and register,” Chinda said. He said: “Maybe, out of ignorance some of you obtained the PVCs, but if you return it to us, nobody will penalise you; but if you are caught with PVCs during the elections, you will be punished. As long as you are not a Nigerian, you will not be allowed to vote during the elections.” Chinda further told them not to allow politicians to induce them into political violence or confusion.” Some of the leaders of the immigrants promised to cooperate with the immigration service, and that they would pass the massage to their people.
