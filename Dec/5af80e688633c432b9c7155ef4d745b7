Senators on Tuesday clashed over the confirmation of four members of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The senators were billed to consider and confirm four nominees, namely Ndasule Moses (North Central), Lawan Mamman (North east), Galadanci Imam Najip (North west) and Adeleke Adebayo Rafiu (Southwest) as members of the commission as provided by the EFCC Act. However, a clash ensued as a result of the position taken by senators from the South East and South South geopolitical zones that the four nominees did not reflect federal character. Senators Victor Umeh from Anambra State, Mathew Urhoghide from Edo and Eyinnaya Abaribe from Abia State all said that the confirmation session for the four nominees should not be done. They said the confirmation session should be put on hold, and that the nominees be returned to President Muhammadu Buhari for reconsideration. However, senators from the North, mainly those of the All Progressives Congress (APC) said the confirmation should go ahead. Senate Leader Ahmad Lawan (APC, Yobe) said as far as the nominations were concerned, no law was breached. On his part, Sen Ali Ndume (APC,  Borno) said the issue should not have been raised on the floor of the Senate since the chairman of the committee that screened the nominees, Chukwuka Utazi (PDP, Enugu) is from the South East and the panel did not raise the issue at its session. The development forced the senators to go into a closed-door session to resolve the matter.
