The gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) in Bauchi State, Dr. Muhammed Ali Pate, has challenged Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar and the ruling All Progressives Party (APC) to a debate. The PRP candidate in a press statement posed several questions in which he alleged among others that since the governor came on board in 2015, the state’s fortune took a downturn. Pate asked, “Why is Bauchi State deteriorating to be among the poorest states in Nigeria? Why is poverty so deep and widespread in our state during your administration? Why is trash widespread in many areas of our state? He called on the governor to explain why non-indigenes of Bauchi State were at the front row of decisions in his administration, and state resources allegedly used to finance people who had no connection with the state and its people. 2019: Abubakar, Pate, Bala Mohammed, 22 others make INEC list for Bauchi governorship Pate promises fair deal for youth, women Pate picks Gwadabe as running mate, promises to transform Bauchi
