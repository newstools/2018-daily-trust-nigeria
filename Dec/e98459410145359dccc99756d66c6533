The President/Chairman in Council of the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM), Prof. Olukunle Iyanda, has said that professional managers occupy positions of leadership and responsibilities and should show examples of transparency which is what is lacking in the country. Speaking at the NIM Continuing Learning and Development (CLAD) programme in Abuja, weekend, Prof Iyanda said professional managers should show examples of transparency, honesty and integrity in the use of resources for the purposes for which those resources are meant. He said: “We know that there are enough resources in the country to be able to cater to the basic needs of the average Nigerian and that our problem is in the management of those resources. The way they are allocated and used and as you know the code of conduct of NIM is for all professional managers to have the most scrupulous and the most efficient way of getting things done.” In a remark, a fellow of the institute and former president of the Real Estates Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), Chief Olabode Emmanuel Afolayan, said the learning programme is apt at this period of Nigeria’s leadership challenge, stressing that it will help to reposition the country. Afolayan advised the incoming political leaders to take lesson from the leaders of today and what they are not doing right, adding, “I’m of the opinion that they should as a matter of urgency begin to nurture how to do things transparently, cheaper and more efficiently for the benefit of all, if they win in the coming election.” Iyanda emerges as NIM president We expelled Tafa Balogun, Cecelia Ibru over unscrupulous acts -  NIM president Corruption must end to set Nigeria on prosperity path – Buhari
