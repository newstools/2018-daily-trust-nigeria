Stakeholders of All Progressives Congress in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State have appealed to Governor Aminu Bello Masari to speed up the construction of the proposed Bakori – Yankwani – Faskari – Bilbis road. They also want him to upgrade the Faskari Comprehensive Health Centre to a General Hospital. The appeal was made during a stakeholders meeting attended by political appointees and over 500 members of the party in Faskari. The convener of the meeting and Deputy Speaker, Katsina State House of Assembly, Engr Dalhatu Tafoki told newsmen, at the end of the meeting that the stakeholders noted that the road has been on the drawing board for a long time. He said there was an urgent need to construct it because of its obvious importance and its history having served as a route for the first premier late Sir Ahmad Bello on his way to Kano then. The road would also be relevant to the nearby communities in Zamfara State in addition to linking three local government areas in the state. Tafoki also said the stakeholders have enjoined the governor to consider the upgrading of the Faskari Comprehensive Health Centre to a General Hospital to serve the increasing population of the town and its environs. He said the facility was currently overstretched and patients now go to Funtua General Hospital for treatment. Earlier, in his remarks Tafoki commended the members  for their loyalty and perseverance to the party and its leaders. Also speaking the Commissioner for Environment Alhaji Hamza Sule said APC had ensured that development projects were evenly distributed across the state. Chairman of APC in Faskari Local Government Area, Alhaji Hamisu Daudawa, who chaired the meeting commended the Gov Aminu Bello Masari for his resilience in fostering unity among party members.
