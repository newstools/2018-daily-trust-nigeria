The PDP governorship candidate in Nasarawa State, Hon. David Ombugadu, yesterday, said the state remains a PDP state despite having the APC in government. Hon. Ombugadu said until 2015, the PDP controlled both the National and state assemblies constituencies in the state.  Ombugadu, who currently represents Akwanga/Nasarawa Eggon/Wamba, spoke in Lagos yesterday during a forum tagged, “A Night for Naija” organised by Project Victory Call Initiative (PVC Naija), an NGO. The initiative which was the brainchild of Apostle Bolaji Akinyemi, was designed to engender ample participation of Nigerians in the 2019 elections. Speaking with Daily Trust on the sidelines of the programme, the PDP candidate said, “Nasarawa State has always been a PDP state if you go through the statistics, and there are some parametres that are indigenous to us. Somebody will ask, why are we having APC government in Nasarawa? “Nasarawa State has always been a PDP state; it will continue to be a PDP state and will remain a PDP state based on the statistics and facts on ground,” he said.
