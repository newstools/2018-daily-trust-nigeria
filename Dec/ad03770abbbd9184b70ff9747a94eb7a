A political group, APC Solidarity Group (ASG), has voiced doubt over the loyalty of Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to the ruling party in its move to retain power in 2019. The convener of the Ondo State-based group, Com. Gbenga Bojuwomi, in a statement he read yesterday while addressing journalists at the APC national secretariat in Abuja, warned the national leadership of the ruling party to move fast to avoid being disappointed at the last minute by the governor and others in 2019. Com. Bojuwomi alleged that the governor had directed all APC members in Ondo State loyal to him to mobilise for the Action Alliance (AA). The group, therefore, called on the DSS, EFCC and ICPC to beam their searchlights on the “financial mobilisation for AA in Ondo and Imo states.”
