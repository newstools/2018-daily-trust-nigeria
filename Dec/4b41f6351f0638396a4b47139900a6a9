The Media Fuse Dentsu Aegis Network has launched the second wave of its Dentsu Aegis’ Proprietary Tool Consumer Connection System (CSS). The CCS is the agency’s single source data system that houses an array of media insights, product consumption and behavioural attitudes that have effects on how consumers interact with the media in relation to brand communication. A statement from the company said that since the inception of the CCS in 2016, it has put the agency in an articulated strategic position on how to connect better with consumers, targeting them efficiently while optimizing advertisers’ budgets. “In developing consumer connection plans that best fits a brands’ objective, the CCS also provides insight into consumers’ mindset when engaging with different media types, or ‘reaction’ variables to media. The CCS also allows us to shape the way we approach content across different target audiences. If, for example, we identify that through CCS, 72 per cent of consumers expect advertising on social media to be entertaining and informative at the same time, this helps in guiding the media channels and creative direction required to achieve media best practices,” the agency said. ….
