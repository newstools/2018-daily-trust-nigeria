The new international terminal building for the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA) Abuja has been slated for commissioning on December 20, 2018. The facility, said to process over 15 million passengers annually, will also offer free wifi and trolley services to passengers in line with international standards. The Managing Director/CEO, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Engr. Salleh Dunoma, after inspecting facilities at the terminal last weekend, said the critical facilities have been installed and test run completed. The facility is built by the Chinese construction firm, CCECC. “We have conducted the first and second tests of all the installations and we have found them to be okay except for one or two issues as with any engineering feat,” he said. “We are working on December 20th for commissioning, which is the date given to us by the minister,” Dunoma announced. He also said foreign airlines are also ready to move into the facility as soon as it is commissioned. Our correspondent also gathered that Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines and British Airways might be the first set of foreign airlines to use the facility. “We are changing our modalities of operation because in the old terminal, we used to have paid trolleys but in the new terminal it will be free, there will also be free WiFi because we have given an approval to a company to install a new WiFi so that our passengers can connect seamlessly,” he said. While the old terminal handles 7.5m passengers annually, the new terminal will take 15m passengers.
