The governorship candidate of Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) in Bauchi State, Prof. Mohammed Ali Pate, says the party has a better plan to develop the state than the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and other parties. He disclosed this while speaking on the chances of the party in the forthcoming governorship and other elections in the state. “Our party, the PRP is really ‎different from the crop that are contesting for the governorship elections in Bauchi State. If you look at its antecedents and ideology, you will know that it is different,” he said. Pate said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and APC that ruled the state in the last‎ 20 years had failed to provide the needed development to the people. He lamented that the two parties failed to also provide a clear development direction through effective utilisation ‎of abundant human and natural resources to lift its people out of poverty, tackle unemployment and provide basic necessities in health, education and other areas. “If you look at the political space as it is, the ruling party and the PDP have not done anything‎. The people who have been ruling the country have not offered any agenda that is different from what they have been doing in the last 20 years, particularly in the last four years. “PRP has offered the people of Bauchi a different vision and a different direction. That is why we are very confident that the acceptance of our party among the generality of the population of Bauchi State will translate into a successful election in 2019,” he added.
