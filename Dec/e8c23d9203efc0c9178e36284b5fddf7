The spokesman of Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign Organisation, Segun Showunmi, has asked the wife of the president, Aisha Buhari, to name those two individuals that allegedly “hijacked the administration” for Nigerians to liberate the president from their stranglehold. Showunmi, who spoke with journalists in Abeokuta, Ogun State, described Aisha Buhari as “the most honest person” in the corridors of power. The PDP presidential campaign spokesman said Buhari doesn’t know “how to fight corruption” even though he had determination to do it. Showunmi, who is the PDP candidate for Abeokuta South Federal Constituency, said Atiku had the capacity to fight corruption in a sustainable manner more than the president. “I want to beg Her Excellency, Dr Aisha Buhari, to shatter the glass ceiling and mention those two people that have hijacked our president so that we can either go to beg them or we fight them and liberate the president of Nigeria from their stranglehold. Maybe in the remaining couple of months that he has, he will be able to be the Buhari that people wanted him to be,” he said. “We want to know them so that we can write their names in the black book of history that they were the ones that destroyed the Buhari presidency,” he added.
