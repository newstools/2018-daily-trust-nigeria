The Director, Corporate Communications Department, Isaac Okorafor, in a statement said the intervention was for requests in the agricultural and raw materials sectors. The yuan, on the other hand, was for Renminbi denominated letters of credit. Mr. Okorafor further said that the market has stabilised owing to the regular interventions by the bank which, he said, has also guaranteed a stable exchange rate for the naira. He assured that the apex bankâ€™s management would remain committed to ensuring that all the sectors of the forex market continued to enjoy access to the needed foreign exchange.
