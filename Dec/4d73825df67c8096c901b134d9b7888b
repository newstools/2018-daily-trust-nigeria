Fifty one adherents of Judaism, who recently protested in Abia to call for a Jewish nation, were yesterday arraigned before an Umuahia Chief Magistrate Court. The court ordered that they be remanded in police custody pending their prosecution at a High Court. They arrested by the police for allegedly being in possession of insignia and emblem of the Indigenous People of Biafra during their protest. The police had said the suspects would be prosecuted for treasonable felony and terrorism for being in possession of the emblem and insignia of the proscribed organization. Chief Magistrate Idika Kalu said the court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the matter or grant them bail and advised the suspects to apply to the High Court for bail just as he ordered the case file be transferred to the state’s Attorney-General. The police prosecution counsel, Adeyemi Olukoye, told the court to refuse bail the suspects bail, arguing that the case was a capital offence. Counsel to the suspects, Anthony Nwafor, had argued that it was illegal and unconstitutional for the persecution to arraign the suspects at a magistrate court when it was obvious that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try the case. Citing several authorities and Supreme Court decisions on similar matter, Nwafor said: “There is nothing like holding charge. Magistrate’s court should not entertain the matter. You cannot come to court with a charge that the court cannot try.” He prayed the court to release the suspects on bail pending their arraignment at the High Court. The matter was consequently adjourned to January 24, 2019, for report on compliance with the court order.
