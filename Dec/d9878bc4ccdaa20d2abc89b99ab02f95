The Ganduje Youth Organisation, yesterday, said plans are in progress for a two million youth march in support of President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in Kano. This was disclosed by the group’s chairman, Comrade Ibrahim Sa’idu Warawa, during a drug abuse discussion session organised by the state’s Directorate of Youth and Economic Empowerment led by Alhaji Ado Abba Tudunwada. According to him, youth in the state never had it so good, adding that hundreds of thousands of them have been empowered in the state in the last three years. “It is a duty for the youth in the state to come out en masse and support the administration of President Buhari and that of Kano State governor,” he said. “We have seen and witnessed the remarkable achievements so far recorded in youth empowerment and for such a wonderful achievement to continue, we figured out that we must support both administrations to make it happen again,” he added.
