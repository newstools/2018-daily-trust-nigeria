The Academic Staff Union of Universities yesterday hit back at a former  national chairman of the All progressives Congress, Bisi Akande, for accusing striking lecturers of producing vagabonds and unemployable graduates. Chairman ASUU, University of Ibadan, Dr Deji Omole, described the APC as party of vagabonds and Akande as “grandfather of half-baked government.” Akande had recently condemned the ongoing ASUU strike reportedly accusing the union of destroying the country with demands that were not genuine. But Omole said: “The same Bisi Akande who himself was a teacher during the free education programme of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo sacked hundreds of teachers and left Osun state education in tatters now claims to value  quality graduates while shying away from adequate investment in education. It is on record that during Akande’s time as governor all the higher institutions in Osun State were closed down due to the anti masses policy of his administration on Education. “It is even self indicting for the leader of a ruling party who is destroying public education with chronic underfunding of the existing institution but busy itself to mushrooming of new Universities without any funding plan to still be talking in public. The budget for education in the current year was wickedly cut down to seven percent to demonstrate their hatred for public funded education.” Osinbajo denies taking over negotiations with ASUU ...As ASUU strike grounds varsities Professor’s salary: ASUU dismisses Fayemi's claim
