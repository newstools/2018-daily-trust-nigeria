A veteran journalist, Mr Olalere Fagbola, has expressed concern that in Nigeria, heroes are not usually appreciated when they are alive. Fagbola, who once worked with the Punch newspaper, said this at the weekend at the Osun NUJ Press Centre, Osogbo, during the launch of his book, ‘Heroes Heroism: Songs and Troubles’, to mark his 65th birthday.e He lamented that most people that had contributed greatly to the Nigerian society through sincere service to humanity were not recognised, appreciated and celebrated, and insisted this must change. Mr Fagbola dedicated his book to the late Chief Olu Aboderin, founder of Punch newspapers; Chief Shuaib Oyedokun, a politician and Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, a businessman. The author said, “As a witness to all norms of the society, including the intellectual norms, it  is about time we assigned value to our collective experience so that we can be a happy nation, especially at a time like this. In advanced nations, only books which have been tested and trusted are launched towards making them more affordable to the masses.”    Armed Forces Remembrance Day: Soldier’s insurance scheme increases death benefit-Ihejirika Plaudits for Yobolisa’s new book An insight into Osoba’s years in Nigerian journalism
