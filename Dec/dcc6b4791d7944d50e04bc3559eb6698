The chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Candido, has said there are sound legal frameworks to ensure that the council’s microfinance bank continues long after his tenure. “My dream is that my legacy outlives my administration. AMAC Microfinance Bank has a legislative backing, for whatever we are going to do there must be legal backing and what they have done for us is legislated to ensure partnership with private developers,” he said. Candido, who spoke on a live radio phone-in programme on Aso FM monitored by our reporter, said the area council was ready to partner with Nigerians that are ready to put in their best to support the microfinance bank. “I am a proponent of continuity in government. If I put in place something that is beneficial to the people, no amount of opposition from any government coming after mine would wish to kill something that is going to have positive effect on the people. “So I intend to ensure this bank outlives my tenure and at the end of my tenure this legacy must be sustained by anybody coming behind me. For any government to kill this microfinance bank, it will meet the wrath of the people because they are going to enjoy the facilities,” he said. He said the establishment of the bank was devoid of partisan politics. “If we involve politicking in the bank it will kill it. We are not going to politicise AMAC Microfinance Bank, our target is the low income earners, and the rural dwellers,” he said.
