The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) yesterday, in the Egyptian capital, announced that the Virtual Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF Virtual) has gone live. This is happening ahead of the kick-off of the inaugural Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF 2018) opening in Cairo this morning. An announcement by the Bank described IATF Virtual as an online platform for buyers and sellers to meet, exchange trade and market information and showcase their products and capabilities to new markets. According to the announcement, IATF Virtual mimics the inaugural IATF, which will run from 11 to 17 December, but will continue well after the physical trade fair would have concluded, with companies with a virtual presence being able to meet attendees, answer questions, and pursue deals in real time. All companies exhibiting at the IATF 2018 will be granted free access to IATF Virtual for 12 months while other exhibitors will be required to pay a standard rate of $750 for 12 months. Exhibitors will receive a Virtual Booth package which consists of an interactive booth, custom-branded with company logo; a custom visitor search feature; live private and group chats with buyers around the world; windows to corporate information, products and/or services; email alerts from visitors to an unattended booth; and 12-month continuous virtual trade show promotion and booth access.
