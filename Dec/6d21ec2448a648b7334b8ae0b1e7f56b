Three people died and 10 others sustained injuries in an accident that occurred on Saturday at Ewu Hill on the Benin-Auchi- Abuja Road . It was gathered that the accident happened when a truck’s driver lost control and rammed into other vehicles. The sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Anthony Okon, who confirmed the incident yesterday, said it involved four trucks, three cars and one bus. “It was a multiple accident, 28 people were involved, three died, 10 were injured while others remain unhurt. “The problem is that, that place needs to be dualised. Construction work is going on there, but at snail speed. If it is not dualised, it will continue to happen just like what happened at Gwagwalada-Abaji-Lokoja in those days,”he said. 10 school pupils injured in Bwari auto crash 5 killed in auto crash along Abuja-Lokoja road Kogi auto crash claims four lives
