About 225 members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gumbo and Yangoji wards of Kwali Area Council on Sunday defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Among defectors were former APC elders of Gumbo ward, Arima Noma, Barnabas Kaura, Kassim Abdulkadir, Asibi Barnabas and Isah Achibebwaye. Speaking on behalf of the defectors, Mr. Barnabas Kaura, said he decided to lead over 200 former members of the APC into the PDP because of the giant strides of the former chairman of the council, under the leadership of Ibrahim Daniel. He alleged that the present APC led administration had not meet up with the expectations of the electorate especially in the area provision of amenities that would impact on the lives of residents of the council. He said the last PDP administration of the council had executed various projects, which he said included the Yangoji- Dafa road, construction of a bridge linking Gwomani and Dafa communities. “For us to remain in APC is just a waste of time because the present administration cannot point at any project it has executed within the past two and half years. All the projects were executed by the PDP administration, which we feel is better to join the party in order to move forward, “ he said. He added,” Most of the existing boreholes in these communities were provided by the past PDP administration. . The party’s vice chairmanship candidate,  Alhaji Salisu Saba, who received the defectors on behalf of the chairmanship candidate, Ibrahim Daniel, commanded them for identifying with the achievement of the past PDP administration in the area. He also praised them for their courage to pitch tent with the PDP, saying they should feel free and promised to treat them equally like other PDP members in the area.  4 PDP stalwarts, over 400 others defect to APC in Kwali FCT poll: 4 PDP stawarts, 430 others defect to APC Ex-council speaker, 3,700 PDP members decamp to APC in Kuje
