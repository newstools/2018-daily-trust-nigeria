A 20-year-old man has drowned while being baptised by a pastor in a river south of Ghana’s capital, Accra. In a video circulating on social media, Yaw Kyeremeh is seen stationed at the banks of River Densu together with a pastor who immersed him in the water. Then after brief prayers he was immersed a second time but he did not emerge from the waters. Accra Regional Police Command spokeswoman Afia Tenge said a junior pastor had been arrested at the scene while police were still searching for the head pastor of the church involved in the baptism.
