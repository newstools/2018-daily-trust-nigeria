The Chairman of the APC Peace and Reconciliation Committee in South-West, Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno state and Kaduna state governor, Mallam Ahmed Nasir el-Rufai, have appealed to the aggrieved aspirants of the party in the state to have the interest of the party at hearts and embrace its peace initiative. At a meeting with the former national assembly aspirants in Ado Ekiti on Monday, they were urged to learn from how the Governor of Lagos state, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode accepted the outcome of the governorship primary in his state without rancour. Other members of the Committee include the Managing Director of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside , former Ekiti Deputy Governor, Prof. Modupe Adelabu and Hajia Seida Usman-Bugaje. They said there was need for people to eschew crisis and work for the party’s unity ahead of 2019. Shettima said the way Ambode handled the outcome of the primary in Lagos had made him a darling of many Nigerian statesmen, urging the aspirants to embrace life from such perspective. “From 1999 to date , Governor Ambode, who is also a member of this committee , I don’t think any Nigerian politician has demonstrated his level of courage in the way he handled the governorship primaries in Lagos. “He is a governor who has worked exceptionally but as I said, politics sometimes comes with unpredictable outcomes. Our courage in reacting to situations like Governor Ambode has withstood is what separates men from boys. “I think anyone unhappy with the outcome of the APC primaries should draw inspiration from Governor Ambode”, he urged.
