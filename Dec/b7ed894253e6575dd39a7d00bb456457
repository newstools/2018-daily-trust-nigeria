The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Administration has commenced de-silting and maintenance of drains within the territory to optimise their performance and checkmate disease outbreak. Mr Niyi Ololoye, Director, FCT Department of Facilities, Maintenance and Management (DFMM) said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja. Ololoya said the exercise was to achieve comprehensive drain maintenance work. ”De-silting, as the name indicates is removal of silt (fine grained clay/lake-bed soil) from drains, lake-bed and gutters, which can be done manually, but usually mechanically.” According to the director, the exercise entails pre-rainy season, rainy season and post-rainy season de-silting to make the territory free of diseases and infections. “The purpose of the exercise is to achieve effective drain maintenance which will enable all the drain channels perform optimally. “It is also not to allow drains get clogged up which is one of the challenges that causes flooding; though maintenance work is being done in preparation for any eventuality,’’ he said. Ololoye said the exercise would be detailed as there is no rain to hinder or delay the work. “In view of efforts to make Abuja one of the world’s best cities, more maintenance work will be seen in subsequent exercises around the Federal Capital City,’’ he added. The areas to be covered included Jabi, Kado, Life Camp and Gwarinpa.
