Senator Shehu Sani has revealed reasons why he stood against the nominees of President Muhammadu Buhari  for appointment into the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, and the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission, ICPC, on Tuesday. Daily Trust reports that the Senate on Tuesday refused to confirm four persons nominated as members of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), following a lopsided appointment. Shehu Sani in a tweet wrote, “Confirming the nominees of Mr President to the anti-corruption bodies is urgent and necessary. “But it’s unfair to do so in view of the fact that some sections of the country are omitted. “I was one of those who unambiguously demanded that the issues raised be addressed before confirmation.” Confirming the nominees of Mr Prez to the anti corruption bodies is urgent & necessary;But its unfair to do so in view of the fact that some sections of the country are omitted.I was one of those who unambiguously demanded that the issues raised be addressed before confirmation. — Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) December 11, 2018  Senate refuses to confirm EFCC nominees Magu:  The Trial of EFCC Boss Senate set to confirm Olukoyede as EFCC scribe
