The Katsina Youths for Sustainable Change (KYSC) has kicked against the omission of the Managing Director of Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman, among political appointees supporting constituents with empowerment packages in Katsina State. A recent statement credited to the state governor, Aminu Masari and the APC Chairman in Katsina State, Shitu Shitu, mentioned the Director General of SMEDAN, Dr. Dikko Radda and the Managing Director of Federal Mortgage Bank, Ahmed Dangiwa, as the only appointees that had provided empowerment packages towards the success of the re-election bid of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019. However, the Director General of KYSC, Sallau Arawa, in a statement issued to newsmen in Katsina, said Hadiza Bala Usman had also done a lot. “The MD Nigerian Port Authority, Hadiza Usman, through the corporate social responsibility projects implemented by NPA in collaboration with the above named KYSC have delivered more  empowerment packages in Katsina State than any other,” he said. “These projects range from provision of furniture in primary schools, provision of solar lights and blankets in 280 Almajiri schools, provision of sewing machines, grinding machines to women and irrigation pumps to rural farmers,” the statement said.
