Amid the rowdiness that greeted the just concluded 2019 budget presentation at the National Assembly, Senator Godswill Akpabio (APC, Akwa Ibom) has called on Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara to resign. Briefing newsmen at the National Assembly complex shortly after the budget presentation, Akpabio described the presiding officers as minority leaders who should do the needful and resign. “Yes, they couldn’t talk because they are minority leaders. They are not even supposed to talk in the first place. They should therefore do the needful and resign honourably or face being booted out of office,” Akpabio told journalists. Akpabio, a former Senate Minority Leader, who some months back defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said the presiding officers were undeserving of their positions. The rowdy budget presentation session saw APC and PDP lawmakers locked in a shouting match at the House of Representatives venue of the presentation, with some almost in fisticuffs.
