A 4.8-magnitude earthquake has hit Sicily near Europeâ€™s most active volcano, Mount Etna, injuring at least 28 people, Italian officials say. Ten people were taken to hospital suffering from light injuries caused by falling debris. Some buildings were damaged in what was the strongest in dozens of tremors since Etna erupted on Monday. Volcanic ash had earlier covered nearby villages and Catania airport had to temporarily suspend operations. The earthquake struck at 03:19 local time (02:19 GMT) on Wednesday near the municipality of Viagrande.
