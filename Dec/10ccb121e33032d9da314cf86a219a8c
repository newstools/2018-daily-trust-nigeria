Yobe State Commissioner of Women Affair, Hajia Hajara Lawan, has said that rampant cases of divorce and young girls hawking are disturbing situations that need to be adressed in the state. Mrs Lawan stated this  yesterday at the ministerial briefing on governor Gaidams achievements to mark the end of his tenure as governor. She noted that  spite leading to divorce was linked to poverty and inability of husbands to provide decent lives to their families. “As government, we started looking at it from the angle of poverty that is why we engage women on skills acquisition trainings, as well as provision of loans and credit facilities as a strategy to make them self-reliant,” she said. She urged women to adopt birth control measure so that they can take full responsibility of their children even without their husbands’ supports. “In our society today, you would see women with 10 children and the husband has four wives. It’s too much for the man to take care of them. So, it’s good for women to have children that they can provide with basic needs of life,” she added. The commissioner also lamented on the practice of sending young girl to hawk items on the streets adding that such practice exposes them to rape and other social vices. She explained that the ministry had embarked on advocacy campaigns to enlighten parents on the dangers of sending their children to streets to hawk. She said, from inception to date,  the administration of Governor Ibrahim Gaidam had spent millions of naira to train and empower women.
