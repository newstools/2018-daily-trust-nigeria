He noted that the technicians certificate they have bagged has a wider acceptance for employment opportunities, within the West African Sub-region. “What this suggests is that the inductees now have a broader market space to exhibit their talents, professional prowess and to prove their abilities as accountants. I therefore challenge you to see this induction as a prelude to your becoming chartered accountants and you should not rest on your oars until this is realized,” he said. Speaking on ‘Using Personal Traits and Vision to Achieve Life Goals’, the Head, AATWA, Sir Herbert Agbebiyi, urged the inductees to remain focused and ensure that they set their goals and prioritise regardless of everything life might bring their way.
