Katsina State has no better option than All Progressive Congress, APC’s Governor Aminu Masari in the 2019 gubernatorial election, giving his credible leadership qualities and performances so far in office. The chairman of APC Youth forum, North West Chapter, Muhammad Bashir Mashi said this while speaking during the launching of a book compilation of the achievements of Masari’s administration since inception. Mashi said though, the administration had a rough take off giving the financial situation the country found itself, his ability to manage the scarce resources for the wellbeing of the state was an eye openner. Mashi, who doubles as the author of the book, said Katsina, under Masari, had recorded tremendous development, saying that “this is one one of the main reasons I compiled this achievement in a book form for all to have a look at and see for themselves what the government was able to record in just three years. “I stand to be corrected, but take a look at all the governorship aspirants and tell me one better than Masari, there is non. Katsina is blessed to have a leader who is committed to the development of the state,” he said.
