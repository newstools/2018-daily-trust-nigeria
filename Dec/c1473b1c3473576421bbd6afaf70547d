The Zenith Bank Plc has launched what it termed: the integration of Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) payments on Point of Sales, otherwise known as “USSD on POS”. It will enable customers pay for their goods and services via POS terminals in merchant locations or on ecommerce websites without the use of cards, the bank said in a statement yesterday. The statement described the introduction  as the first ever by any Nigerian bank. According to the statement, the innovative payment solution, which is powered by CoralPay, allows Zenith Bank customers to use the *966# Eazy Banking(USSD) to pay for goods and services on POS terminals in merchant locations or on ecommerce websites through the generation of a payment code on the POS terminal which is then confirmed by the customer using their USSD pin. The Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Zenith Bank Plc., Mr. Peter Amangbo noted in the statement  that the bank has always been at the vanguard of technological innovations geared towards creating value for its customers. He added that the solution is an exciting and innovative initiative in promoting financial inclusion, facilitating payments by customers either remotely in the comfort of their homes/offices or at merchant locations without the use of a payment card.
