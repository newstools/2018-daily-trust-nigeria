The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Monday night met behind closed doors with the leading presidential candidates ahead of the 2019 general elections. The meeting which is still ongoing at the National Christian Centre, Abuja, has the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, representing President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC), while the ex-governor of Anambra state and Vice-Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi, is standing in for Atiku Abubakar. Speaking to journalists when the meeting break sessions outside the hall, the CAN President, Dr. Samson Ayokunle, said the meeting aims at interrogating the credentials of the candidates as well as their plans for the nation and the church. “The motive is not to take for granted the 2019 elections. Nigeria will depend on next year’s presidential election. That is, how free and fair it is going to be. “The church cannot take the back seat in this situation because it can only prosper when Nigeria prospers. If the election is not free and fair, then, all Nigerians including the church will be in trouble. “So, we decided to reach out to the presidential candidates to ask them their credentials for aspiring to the highest office in the land. Also, to interrogate their plans for all including the church. “We also brought them together to speak to their consciences so that they don’t set this nation on fire. We are going to draw our conclusion after we have finished our interview,” Ayokunle said. Who picks PDP’s ticket in 2019?
