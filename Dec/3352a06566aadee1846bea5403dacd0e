The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) on Wednesday marched in Abuja to protest three years of the detention of its leader, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky. The group marched around the Federal Secretariat and Eagle Square areas as a detachment of police deployed for the protest prevented them from accessing the National Assembly gate. In an address by S.I. Ahmad of the Academic Forum of the IMN, the sect vowed to continue to expose the alleged atrocities of the federal government against the sect since 2015. IMN claimed that on December 12, 2015, the Nigerian Army planned and systematically attacked Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky and members of the sect under a hoax of road blockage. “With all of these atrocities and despite a judgement of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja that ordered for the immediate and unconditional release of Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky since December 2, 2016; Buhari still refuse to release the Sheikh. “Three years after the Zaria massacre and despite the recommendation made by the report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry of July 2016 for the prosecution of the perpetrators of Zaria massacre, the Nigerian Government under Buhari is yet to prosecute the perpetrators of these atrocities,” he said. The IMN claimed that about 50 of its members were killed in Abuja by joint security forces comprising the army and mobile police during the 2018 Arba’een Trek in October.
