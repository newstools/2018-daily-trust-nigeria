The Oyo State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), Barrister Mutiu Agboke, yesterday, revealed that some politicians in the state had approached the commission for purchase of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs). He, however, kept mute on the identity of the party and individuals who approached his staff for the purpose. Agboke made this revelation while speaking at a one day seminar of the Association of Online Media Practitioners of Nigeria (OMPAN), Oyo State chapter. He said people needed to know that knowledge in election was about law, process and regulations that guided the entire electoral system. “There is no available PVC INEC can sell to any politician and none of our staff will compromise this” he said. “I have nothing to hide concerning the 2019 general elections in Oyo State, whoever wins in 2019 shall be announce as the winners,” Agboke said. The seminar was organised for training members on how to promote media integrity and enhance a better society through balanced and objective news reportage. Tasking online media practitioners on professionalism, urged them to remain neutral in their reportage, noting that they should always check their fact before publishing any news so as to avoid misleading the public. “Get your fact before you publish any story, be ethical professional. By doing this, 2019 elections will be credible, free and fair,” he said. The two resource persons at the event, Wale Ojo-Lanre and Pastor Bisi Oladele encouraged the online media practitioners to be more diligent in their services.
