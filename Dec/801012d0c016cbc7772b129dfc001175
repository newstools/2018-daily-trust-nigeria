A former governor, Ali Sa’ad Birnin Kudu, three gubernatorial aspirants alongside over a thousand others, yesterday, defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa State. Tijjani Ibrahim Kiyawa and Mohammed Danladi Auyo, who contested for the governorship tickets of the PDP and Ramatu Sabo Elleman of SDP, were among those that defected to the APC. Many commissioners that served under the immediate past PDP-led government in the state were also part of those that abandoned their former party for APC. Governor Muhammadu Badaru Abubakar handed over the defectors to the National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole accompanied by the National Secretary of the party, Mai Mala Buni and other leaders, at an elaborate event organised to receive the defectors and the formal launch of the governor’s re-election campaign. In his speech, Governor Badaru said with the calibre of people that abandoned PDP for APC, it was clear that nobody was left in PDP apart from a former governor of the state, Sule Lamido and his son, Mustapha Sule Lamido, who is also the PDP candidate for Jigawa Central Senatorial District. The Deputy National Chairman of APC (South), Niyi Adebayo, who represented Oshiomhole, assured the defectors that they stood to benefit from all rights and privileges enjoyed by other members. Buni on his part said the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration had done a lot at the national and state levels and therefore deserved reelection.
