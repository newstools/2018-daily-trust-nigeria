The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC for next year’s governorship election in Cross River State, Senator John Owan-Enoh, has flagged off his campaign. At an interdenominational solemn assembly, he first presented a four-year economic development plan from 2019 to 2023 for the state which would guide him if elected. Owan-Enoh said that the plan was anchored on the vision of “making Cross River State the preferred investment destination in West Africa”. He said his government will collaborate with the Federal Government, development planners, research organisations, organised private sector, local government and will carry out civil service reforms, prudent financial management and budget alignment. Owan-Enoh reiterated his commitment to deliver on promise based on his track record saying, “the road maintenance Agency shall be sufficiently funded to ensure zero potholes in Calabar and other urban towns, unlike what is presently obtainable in the state. “We will not wait for elections before doing what we are supposed to do as a government. New feeder rural roads shall be constructed to improve timely evacuation of agricultural harvests and for access to tourism sites.” The APC candidate said if he became the governor next year he will work to see that a calabar enjoys special status as Lagos, being a former national capital.
