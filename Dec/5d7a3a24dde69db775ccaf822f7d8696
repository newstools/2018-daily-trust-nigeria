A Member of the House of Representatives, Yuguda Hassan Kila, the Speaker of the Jigawa State House of Assembly, Isa Idris, a former Minister of Commerce, Bello Maitama Yusuf, and other stalwarts of the APC narrowly escaped being lynched by irate youths in Nasarawa village of Gwaram Local Government Area of Jigawa State, Daily Trust gathered yesterday. The APC politicians from the local government area reportedly converged on the country home of the former minister in Nasarawa on Saturday for a political meeting, but irate youths allegedly stormed the venue and disrupted the meeting. Daily Trust learnt that the rampaging youths, who were largely from Sara village, stormed the venue of the meeting with a view to unleash terror on Hon. Kila for alleged poor representation in the House of Representatives, and in the process, descended on all the politicians present. It was further gathered that the police had to shoot sporadically into the air to disperse the youths for the politicians to be able to escape but that in the process most of their (politicians) vehicles were vandalised. Another source told Daily Trust that the meeting which turned awry was part of the reconciliation process of the party in the local government area. It would be recalled that a state-level reconciliation committee for the party was recently inaugurated. The police spokesperson of Jigawa State, SP Abdul Jinjiri, confirmed the incident but said it was a clash among political thugs and that it occurred after the meeting was concluded. SP Jinjiri added that, “About 10 thugs have been arrested by the police.” Thugs disrupt political meeting in Jigawa Deadly return of political thugs 2015: Politicians turn to courts, alternative parties to secure tickets
