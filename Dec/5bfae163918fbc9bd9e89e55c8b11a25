The Senator representing the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Philip Tanimu Aduda, has awarded a contract for the construction of a clinic in Gbazango community in Bwari Area Council of the FCT. Sen. Aduda, who performed the foundation laying ceremony of the clinic yesterday, said with the completion of the clinic, residents would have access to quality health care services. He said the construction of the clinic was part of his constituency projects, which he said would reduce the health care challenges of the residents. Aduda said the 16-bed clinic, with doctors’ chalet, would go a long way to ensure health care delivery to the residents of the community, as well as surrounding villages in the area. He said he had ensured that similar projects were constructed in various communities in the six area councils of the FCT, adding that health equipment worth millions of naira were provided in all the completed clinics. “It is obvious that most of our rural people have been facing the challenge of lack of access to health care service delivery. It was on this premise that I decided to build one for the people of Gbazango community, like the ones I built across other villages in the FCT,” he said. Aduda assured that he would mobilise the contractor to ensure speedy completion of the project before the end of January, 2019. The Dakaci of Gbazango, Alhaji Mohammed Jibrin, commended the senator for identifying with the major challenge his subjects had been facing over the years. Alhaji Jibrin said lack of access to treatment had been a nightmare to his  subjects, saying the intervention of the senator had brought a big relief to the residents. The dakaci thanked the senator and appealed to him to intensify effort towards completing the project.
