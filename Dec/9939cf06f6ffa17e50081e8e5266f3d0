Innovative ICT solutions and entrepreneurship development event provides an avenue for self expression and creativity through technology. And this is why some ICT stakeholders are organising an hackathon and incubation event where people with technology backgrounds and business vision come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from the scratch. These solutions are usually in the form of websites, mobile apps, IOT, robotics and more.
