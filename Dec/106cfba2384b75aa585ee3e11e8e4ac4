Dr Torngee Malu, a Senatorial Candidate for Action Alliance (AA) in Benue State, has promised quality representation of his constituents, especially the youth, if elected in the 2019 general elections. Malu, a plastic surgeon, contesting for the Benue Zone A Senatorial District (Benue Northeast), made the promise in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Tuesday. According to him, sinking of boreholes and donation of motorcycles to constituencies as a political tradition is not enough. The candidate said he would make personal sacrifices to empower women and youths so as to reduce poverty in his constituency. “My primary agenda if elected will be the development of education, agriculture and primary healthcare services to alleviate the sufferings of the people. “Nigerian youths are hardworking, intelligent and talented. All they need is opportunities and the biggest opportunity you can give a Nigerian youth is education. “The biggest security in any country or society is development and job opportunities as well as technical education,’’ he said. Malu promised to embark on empowerment programmes for the youth and schemes to support the less privileged in his constituency.
