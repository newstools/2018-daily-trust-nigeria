An indigenous gas firm, Axxela Limited, has signed a Gas Transportation Agreement (GTA) with the West African Gas Pipeline Company Ltd (WAPCo) to transport over 15 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) of natural gas via the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) to Lome, Togo. During the signing ceremony held in Accra, Ghana, Axxela Chief executive officer, Bolaji Osunsaya, said the partnership between Axxela, WAPCo and the West African Gas Pipeline Authority (WAGPA), portends major benefits for the West African gas markets. “The flow of new molecules beyond the existing foundation contracts will diversify gas supply sources into the WAGP and is a testament to Axxela’s proactive mid-term growth plan propelled by our collective professionalism, strategic partnerships, and drive to achieve excellence across our business enterprise.” Also commenting at the signing ceremony, WAPCo’s  Managing Director, Walter Perez, stated: “With public and private players increasingly working together to propel the gas advantage, our partnership with Axxela speaks to our overarching strategy for increased regional supply and participation.” Axxela, in a statement, is also developing a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) in West Africa’s main commercial hub, Lagos, with the capacity to serve Nigeria and the region. The concept will see the injection of gas via a regasification terminal at a strategic location along the city’s coastline, with gas supplied via LNG shuttle vessels. The virtual pipeline solution will also enable uninterrupted gas supplies and enhance gas utilization across key industrial clusters. The WAGP is a 678km regional pipeline linking the Escravos-Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS) in Nigeria to Takoradi in Ghana, with gas delivery laterals from the main line extending to Cotonou (Benin), Lome (Togo) and Tema (Ghana). Ghana plans to cut gas supply from Nigeria in 2015 WAPCo trains 320 Nigerian artisans with N400m in 6 years WAPCo transports 70m scf of gas daily, says MD
