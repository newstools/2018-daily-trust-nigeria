Barely six days after the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, warned political thugs to desist from removing posters of candidates of political parties, six persons were at the weekend arrested allegedly in the act by an Anti-Crime patrol team attached to the Ikeja Division of the state command. Those arrested are Olagokun Odunayo, Kool-Kloud Henry, Ugaju Joseph, Damilola Omidiji, Michael Kate and Banwo Olagokun. The suspects were said to be members of a pressure group, the ‘Take It Back’ movement and were arrested while allegedly tearing posters of other political parties at about 2.30am on Saturday and replacing them with those of the African Action Congress (AAC). This, the police said, was contrary to a Lagos State Sinage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA) law which forbids advertisers from pasting posters at no other hour than daytime. An agreement had been reached at a meeting held at the Police Officers Mess, GRA, Ikeja, on Wednesday December 5, 2018 to the effect that no political party should undertake the defacing of campaign posters of other political parties, nor the  destruction of their billboards. The meeting, involving the Independent National Electoral Commission and chairmen of all political parties in the state and their flag bearers, was chaired by Edgal. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, who confirmed the arrest, said that Edgal had directed that the suspects be charged to court.
