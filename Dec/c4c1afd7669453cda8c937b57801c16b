Prof. Ishaq Akintola, Director, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has appealed to the Federal Government to do everything within its power to ensure smooth supply of fuel this Yuletide. Akintola, who made the appeal in Lagos on Wednesday, advised both oil marketers and the Federal Government to iron out their differences in order to avoid fuel scarcity during the Yuletide. Oil marketers issued a seven-day ultimatum to government, threatening to embark on a strike and shut down all depots across the country if their outstanding N800 billion subsidy debts are not paid. According to him, Yuletide is a sensitive period, when most Nigerians choose to travel to their cities and villages in order to cement family ties. “It is not the right time to allow fuel scarcity. “We appeal to the Federal Government to do everything within its power to ensure that oil marketers do not carry out their threat. Unlike in the past, this administration has been able to ensure smooth supply of fuel. “There have been no queues in petrol stations across the country. We appreciate this feat but we are saying it should not be allowed to happen. “Fuel scarcity causes a lot of inconvenience for ordinary Nigerians, ‘’ he said in a statement. Akintola appealed to the Federal Government to avert another fuel scarcity, particularly in the interest of ordinary Nigerians who might be caught in the crossfire as transport fares would most likely go up.
