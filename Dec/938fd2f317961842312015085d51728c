Kano Electricity Distribution Company  (KEDCO) is set to generate N4bn in 2019, the Managing Director of the company, Alhaji Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna, has said. Gwamna, who made the disclosure while addressing newsmen on the achievements of the company in 2018, said although it operated at a loss, the target was achievable. He said the company’s revenue generation was gradually increasing, as according to him, N2bn was generated in 2017 and N2.7bn in 2018. “Although we are not able to generate N4bn this year, however, we will not relent in our efforts to generate it next year. “However, our major concern is the attitude of some of our customers who have developed the habit of not paying their electricity bills. “Though we have improved in our service delivery and captured a number of customers, yet many customers are not paying the electricity they are consuming. So, our greatest challenge is collection of electricity fees from customers,” he said.
