The APC has asked the Supreme Court to sack Governor Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State on the ground of alleged irregularities in the 2014 primary election that produced him as the party’s candidate. The APC in a dramatic twist,  now backed the appeal earlier filed by Senator Umar Dahiru and Aliyu Abubakar Sanyinna, who both contested the primary with Governor Tambuwal for the governorship position. A new counsel, Abduganiyu Arobo, yesterday, announced appearance for the APC in place of Jibrin Okutepa (SAN), who had in the past represented the party in the matter. Okutepa, who acknowledged the change of counsel by the APC, however, declined to change the argument of the party, which he had canvassed at both the Federal High Court and Court of Appeal for the party on behalf of Governor Tambuwal, who recently defected to the PDP. Counsel to the aspirants, Roland Otaru (SAN) had argued at the Court of Appeal that the delegates accredited for the primary in 2014 were not authentic delegates, and therefore the outcome should be voided by the court. Meanwhile, presiding judge, Justice Mohammed Dattijo, had fixed January 25, 2019 to decide the preliminary objection by Tambuwal against the suit, while March 5, 2019 would be used to hear the main appeal.
