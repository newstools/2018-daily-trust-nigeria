The Gubernatorial Candidate of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, in Ogun state, Gboyega Nasir Isiaka, yesterday vowed to represent the best interest of the entire State without favouring one senatorial district over the other. He said there is uneven spread distribution of developmental projects in the State by the current administration which “has seen the Central Senatorial district becoming the largest beneficiary at the detriment of other divisions.” Isiaka made the pledge while addressing a mammoth crowd at Ijebu Imushin, at an event to round off his campaign tour of Ijebu East local government. According to the two-time governorship candidate, “Concentrating 70 percent of the state’s resources in one part of the State at the extreme expense of other parts is morally wrong”. “We would ensure all parts of Ogun State are evenly developed. We would not run an irresponsible, one-sided government. I have the fear of God and it is God that makes one Governor”. The ADC flagbarer however promised to be a listening governor if elected in 2019, adding that his bid to govern the State is premised on his capacity, experience, vision for Ogun and not necessarily because of his communal ties to Ogun West. “I assure you we would remain level headed. I have been voted for twice. My information is in public glare. I am not someone who will get corrupt by power. I remain an ‘Omoluabi’ to the core and I will rule with a sincere heart,” he said.
