The secretary of Accord Party (AP) in Oyo State, Mr. Sunday Igbinsola, has accused the current administration led by Governor Abiola Ajimobi of the APC of destroying the legacies of the past administration in the state. He said APC had failed the masses hence Accord Party remained the best alternative to win the gubernatorial election in 2019. Igbinsola stated this while speaking with journalists in Ibadan at the flag-off of the party’s campaign and presentation of Alhaji Saheed Ajadi, the Accord Party gubernatorial candidate in the 2019 election to supporters and loyalists of the party. “Today, the standard of governance in Oyo State is very low, poor and of no direction. Yes, we need change, but the change we are talking about is real change,” he said. “Accord has the most credible candidates in the forthcoming elections. People that have no blemish; we parade people with no criminal records. From governorship candidate, to senators, federal representatives to state assembly candidates, they are all people with unquestionable character. “Our party’s gubernatorial candidate, Alhaji Saheed Ajadi is a complete gentleman, a professional who has used his wealth of experience to assist in developing some states in the South West, including states under APC,” he added.
