The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is set to commission the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) Training Centre, which has been designated as Global Training Centre of Airports Council International (ACI). General Manager, Corporate Communications I’d FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu said the facility, which is situated at Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA) Lagos would be commissioned this Friday. According to her, the commissioning and designation of the facility as ICAO/ACI Global Training Centre would further enhance training of technical personnel for the industry. It would also save the country of huge foreign exchange as the training would be domesticated. Yakubu explained that before the facility was approved, inspectors from ICAO had visited the facility regularly and discovered some open items, which she said were closed by FAAN’s management before the final approval was given by ICAO.
