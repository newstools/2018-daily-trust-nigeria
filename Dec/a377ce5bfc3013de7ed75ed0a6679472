A total of N1.77bn has been donated to President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term bid by farmers and fertiliser producers in the country. The donations were announced on Wednesday at an Anchor Borrowers’ Gala Night held at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.  Our correspondent reports that while the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria donated N1.2bn, the Fertilizer Producers and Suppliers Association of Nigeria (FEPSAN) gave N570m for the president’s re-election bid. The president of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, Aminu Goroyo, who announced the donation, said the introduction of the Anchor Borrowers programme had turned around the fortunes of the 12.2 million registered members of the association.  Goroyo said each member of the association contributed N100, making a total  N1.2bn for the president’s re-election bid. The president of FEPSAN, Mr. Thomas Etuh, said members of his association donated the money to the president for turning around the fortunes of the agricultural sector of the country. He said from four fertiliser blending plants before 2015, the country now has 30 plants working at full capacity. President Buhari thanked them for the gesture, saying the National Bureau of Statistics’ (NBS) reports confirmed that his administration’s policies were yielding results. In attendance at the event were the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, Zamfara State Governor, Abdulaziz Yari, Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, Jigawa State Governor Badaru Abubakar, APC National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole, Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha and Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, among others.  2019: Fertiliser producers donate N570m for Buhari's campaign CBN anchor borrower: How farmers sell inputs in Nasarawa Senate wants CBN Anchor Borrowers’ project in 36  States, FCT
