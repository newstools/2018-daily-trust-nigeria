The Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN) gubernatorial candidate in Adamawa state, Abel Behora, has warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) led government in the state to stop celebrating road construction to deceive the electorate. According to him, APC’s government is insensitive and has failed to address the farmers/herders’ crisis in the southern zone of the state. Behora disclosed this during the zonal flag-off campaign in Numan local government area of the state. He urged electorate to use their votes wisely in order to vote out APC for security and stability just as he promised to empower women and youth in skill acquisition if elected in 2019. Also speaking, the ANN Chairman, Ibrahim Bebetu,  also solicited for the support of electorate in mobilizing themselves to the polling booths come 2019. Bebetu lauded the people for their supports and assured that they would be carried along in the party affairs always. 2019: Gang up against Buhari, APC will fail – El-Rufai Buhari’s biggest hurdles ahead 2019 polls 2019: Gov.
