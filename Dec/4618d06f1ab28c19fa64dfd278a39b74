The Allied Peoples Movement (APM) gubernatorial candidate in Ogun State, Adekunle Akinlade, yesterday, said the electorate have resolved to resist extension of political hegemony to the state by “external forces” by voting the candidate of their choice in 2019 general elections. Akinlade stated this yesterday at the APM official campaign flag-off and adoption of President Muhammadu Buhari as the presidential candidate. The MKO International Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta, venue of the rally witnessed massive crowd comprising party members, leaders and candidates for various offices in the next election. Apart from Buhari, the opposition party equally adopted Governor Ibikunle Amosun and Lekan Mustapha, both APC flagbearers, as the senatorial candidates for Ogun Central and Ogun East. Akinlade, who is the anointed candidate of the governor, described the crisis which culminated into his defection alongside others from the ruling party to APM, as “tortuous and challenging.” “For about two months, you are all witnesses that we had to fight for the freedom of our people to freely choose the government of their choice. “We had to contend with some forces that are determined to reverse the march to prosperity in Ogun State,” Akinlade said. He promised to sustain Amosun’s “Mission to Rebuild” the state with improvement on road infrastructure, health care delivery, education, rural development, agriculture and youth empowerment.
