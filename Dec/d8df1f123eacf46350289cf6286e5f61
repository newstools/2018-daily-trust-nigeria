Youths in Sokoto state have given the Nigerian Immigration Service 24-hour ultimatum to respond to the recent allegation by Governor Ahmed El-rufa’i of Kaduna state that foreigners were imported for the flag off of Northwest presidential campaign of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Sokoto on Monday. The youths stormed the Federal Secretariat where the zonal office of NIS is located armed with placards some of which read “El-rufa’i is a liar”. Their spokesperson, Dr. Awwal Ahmad said they were disturbed by the allegation which has socioeconomic and security implications. “We wish to draw the attention of all the authorities concerned and agencies manning our borders to this allegation because it involved national security,” they said According to Ahmad, the Governor’s claim had questioned the moral capacity of security agencies in the country and as such they need to respond to it. “It is on this note that we, the law abiding citizens of Sokoto mobilized for this peaceful demonstration and wish to issue a 24 hours’ ultimatum to the Nigeria Immigration Service to issue a statement in response to this powerful allegation, especially coming from the Chief Security Officer of a state,” he added He noted that anything short of this could jeopardize and compromise the security of Sokoto. They however, threatened to take decisive action if their demand was not met before the ultimatum elapse.
