The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Katsina State has raised concern over the continuous removal and vandalisation of its billboards and posters across the state. The state PDP chairman, Salisu Majigiri in a chat with newsmen, said the action allegedly being carried out by the police on the orders of the state government was unconstitutional and uncalled for. Majigiri said the party started erecting billboards and pasting posters from December 2, 2018 when INEC announced the commencement of campaigns. He said the party could not be subjected to intimidation and harassment. But the spokesman of the state police command SP Gambo Isah denied the allegation, saying its officers never carried out such operation. Isah told newsmen that the police only provided security to the state environmental protection officers who went on field work. “Police do provide such services to check attack on their officers when carrying out such operations. Last week, we called for a meeting with all the parties involved, including APCON and SEPA. None of the parties attended,” he said.
