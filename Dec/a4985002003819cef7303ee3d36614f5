As part of efforts to help female IDPs returning to their home communities in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states to become self reliant, the Victims Support Fund (VSF) has launched an empowerment programme for women. Under the programme, which was launched recently in Bama, Borno State, each female returnee to a home community would be given N30,000 to engage in a business activity. Speaking at the launching, VSF Chairman, General Theophilus Yukubu  Danjuma, said the programme was initiated in order to provide succour to women who suffered immense losses in business to assist them to recover. Represented by the Vice Chairman of the VSF, Tijjani Musa Tumsa, Gen. Danjuma said 2000 women returnees in Borno State alone would benefit from the programme. While assuring that VSF would continue supporting the victims of insurgency to rescue them from the calamitous situation in which they found themselves, the VSF Chairman called on the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the money to empower themselves. In his remarks, the Executive Director of VSF, Professor Sunday Ochoche, represented by the Fund’s Director of Programmes, Professor Nana Tanko, expressed appreciation to the Fund’s partners for their commitment at selecting deserving beneficiaries. The representatives of women groups praised the VSF for initiating the empowerment programme, expressing the hope that it would help the beneficiaries to become self reliant.
