Eight persons have lost their lives in a communal clash between the Gaba and Anfani communities in the Lavun Local Government Area of Niger state. Daily Trust learnt that scores of people also sustained various degrees of injuries in the fracas which occurred on Thursday. The crisis was said to have been over a parcel of land allegedly given by the Gaba community to their Anfani counterparts several decades ago. Our correspondent gathered that disagreement ensued when Gaba community reached out to Anfani in a bid to reclaim the disputed land leading to a litigation at the high court in Bida which ruled in favour of Gaba community. A team which include a surveyor with the state ministry of works who went to enforce the court judgment was said to have been waylaid. However it was gathered that the Surveyor was spared after it was discovered that he was not a native of Gaba village but he was said to have sustained injuries and was hospitalised at the Federal Medical Centre in Bida. The State Police Commandâ€™s Public Relations Officer, DSP Muhammad Abubakar Dan-Ina who confirmed the development to Daily Trust on Friday said the police evacuated eight corpses to the General Hospital Bida mortuary. He said the crisis was over a disputed land, adding that those who sustained injuries are receiving medical attention at the Bida General hospital. He said the Police Area Commander in Bida had led heavily armed operatives to restore normalcy to the area and to avert the possibility of a reprisal. He however said no arrest had been made and that investigation into the disturbance has commenced. 5 die, 11 injured in Niger communal clash 4 killed in fresh communal clash in Benue Fresh communal clash claims 4 in Benue
