French judges have dropped a long-running investigation into the shooting down of a plane carrying the former Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana. His death in 1994 was a trigger of the genocide. A French inquiry began four years later at the request of relatives of the French crew members who died. A judge accused Tutsi rebels, led by the current president, Paul Kagame, of the attack; arrest warrants were issued for a number of people close to him. The charges were dropped on 21 December, a judicial source said on Wednesday.
