The Chairman of the APC Peace and Reconciliation Committee in South-West, Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State and Kaduna state governor, Mallam Ahmed Nasir el-Rufai, have appealed to the aggrieved aspirants of the party in the state to have the interest of the party at heart and embrace its peace initiative. At a meeting with the former national assembly aspirants in Ado Ekiti yesterday, they urged them to learn from how the Governor of Lagos State, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode accepted the outcome of the governorship primary in his state without rancour. They said there was need for people to eschew crisis and work for the party’s unity ahead of 2019. Shettima said the way Ambode handled the outcome of the primary in Lagos had made him a darling of many Nigerian statesmen, urging the aspirants to embrace life from such perspective.
