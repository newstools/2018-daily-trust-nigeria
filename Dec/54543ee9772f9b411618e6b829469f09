Leaders of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) have protested their exclusion from the presidential debates organised for some parties ahead of the 2019 elections. The National Director of Publicity of the party, Ifeanacho Oguejiofor, said yesterday in a statement that there was no justification for the exclusion of APGA’s presidential/vice-presidential candidates from the debates organised by the Nigeria Election Debate Group (NEDG) and Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON) recently. “In the first place, it was purely a private sector initiative powered by both organisers. That notwithstanding, APGA made a very strong representation to the organisers when it learned of the exclusion early on Monday. “In response, the organisers drew our attention to the fact that the choice of presidential and vice-presidential candidates to appear for the debate was done by voters on the social media platform, which it thoroughly supervised. It is our position that there was no reason for not including APGA candidates on the debates since the party is the third largest political party in the country, with a serving governor and numerous members in the state and national legislative assemblies,” Oguejiofor said.
