The Senator representing Kaduna Central district, Shehu Sani, has showered praises on President Muhammadu Buhari administration for completing abandoned projects by previous government. The lawmaker also told the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, not to expect praises after abandoning almost every project it started during its reign. According to the lawmaker, praises should go to those who completed the projects and not those that started and abandoned them. He tweeted, “The previous Governments should not be expecting medals and applause for leaving behind a litany and legacy of uncompleted and abandoned projects, overrun with grasses and used as public toilet. In a marathon, the trophy always goes to those that breast the tape.” The previous Governments should not be expecting medals and applause for leaving behind a litany and legacy of uncompleted and abandoned projects,overrun with grasses and used as public https://t.co/MFB1mrJp7X a marathon,the trophy always goes to those that breast the tape. — Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) December 21, 2018  Paying lip-service to housing Senators’ outrageous running costs Shehu Sani to Buhari: Spend Abacha''s loot on projects Nigerians can see with their ‘korokoro’ eyes
