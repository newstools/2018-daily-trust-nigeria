The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission yesterday before a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos, docked the president of the Nigerian Bar Association, Paul Usoro, over an alleged N1.4 billion fraud. Justice Muslim Hassan granted him N250 million bail and one surety in like sum who must be a landed property owner in Lagos. The court also ordered that both Usoro and the surety must deposit their travelling documents with the court as part of the bail condition. In the charge filed by the EFCC, Usoro was alleged to have converted and laundered the money in connivance with Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State. Emmanuel was however not listed as a defendant in the charge as the EFCC indicated that he was “currently constitutionally immuned against criminal prosecution”. Also mentioned in the charges were Nsikan Nkan, described as Commissioner for Finance, Akwa Ibom State; Mfon Udomah, described as the Accountant General of Akwa Ibom State and Uwemedimo Nwoko, the Akwa Ibom State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice; as well as Margaret Ukpe, all of whom were said to be on the run. The EFCC alleged that Usoro, in connivance with those mentioned, conspired to commit the offence sometime in 2015 “within the jurisdiction of this honourable court”. It claimed that the N1.4bn allegedly converted and laundered by the defendants belonged to the Akwa Ibom State Government. Further trial in the case has been fixed for February 5 and March 6, 2019.
