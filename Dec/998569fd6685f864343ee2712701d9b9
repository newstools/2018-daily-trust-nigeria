A bill to restrict children of public officers in Nigeria from schooling abroad, on Wednesday failed to scale through the second reading. The bill was, however, stepped down because it “encroaches on fundamental human rights,” according to House Leader, Femi Gbajabiamila (APC, Lagos). “You will agree with me that this bill restricts the fundamental human rights of citizens of Nigeria. Note that there are some specialized courses not offered in Nigerian institutions. “What if a student gets a fully-funded scholarship, are you going to discriminate against him or her on the basis of his or her parents?” Gbajabiamila queried while arguing against the bill. Recall that the “Bill for an Act to Regulate International Studies for Wards and Children of Nigerian Public Officers to Strengthen Indigenous Institutions, and Provide Efficient Educational Services for National Development” was read for the first time in 2017. Sponsor of the bill, Sergius Ogun (PDP, Edo) said its intention was to ensure that Nigerian public officers sit up to attend to Nigerian educational institutions in the face of imminent collapse, especially amidst frequent strikes. Ogun, leading debate for a second reading of the bill, had noted its potentialities to enhance the indigenous educational institutions, and by so doing, create employment opportunities. However, no sooner had Ogun moved for a second reading of the bill than other lawmakers immediately drew his attention to its human rights implications. At that point, Speaker Yakubu Dogara stepped down the bill.
