There seems to be no respite yet for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as indications emerged that the Imo State chapter of the party may head to court to challenge the dissolution of its state executive committee by the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. Oshiomhole had after a meeting of the National Working Committee of the party announced the dissolution of the state executives, alongside that of Ogun state. The chairman had alleged that they were loyal to their state governors, who had been at logger heads with the party over the non-recognition of their candidates as the party’s flag bearers in the 2019 governorship elections. A source close to the party, who spoke anonymously to Daily Trust on Wednesday, described the act as illegal. “It is an illegal act and we will challenge it in court. He cannot run away with this one this time around”, the source said. However, the Imo state chairman of the party, Mr. Dan Nwafor, said he has no comments for now. He told Daily Trust that he is studying the implication of the action and will address the press tomorrow (Thursday). 2019: As submission of party candidates closes today Minister kicks as APC inaugurates new C’River exco APGA vows to sue Okorocha  for cross-carpeting
