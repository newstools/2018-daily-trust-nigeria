El-Amin International School, Abuja, at the weekend held its end of year party amidst funfair and glamour. The pupils and their parents were thrilled as well as their teachers. The annual party, which held at the school’s mini stadium, was tagged ‘Believe Concert’ and was also attended by well-wishers of the school. Pupils of the school could not hide their feelings as they danced to music of their choice while their teachers and parents supported them in a colourful manner. The director of the school, Hajiya Jummai Sambo, said the concert, was organised annually to bring out the talents in the children, adding that it was meant to support them socially aside from the academic and moral teachings they acquired during the academic period. “We want to bring out the talents of the kids either hidden or open, that is why we are making it fun for them so that they realize they can do it themselves,’’ Sambo said. She said the management of the school was glad with the academic result of the students, assuring that the school would continue to improve on its standard. Hajiya Sambo commended the parents and guardians of the students for their support and charged them to continue to engage the children while on holidays through house chores, reading of books as well as taking them on social outings. Earlier, the exam officer of the school, Onyeneke Magnus, said the gathering was meant to bring the management, teachers and parents of the school together and enhance the social lives of the children.
