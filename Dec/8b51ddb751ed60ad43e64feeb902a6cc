Motorcycle operators in Imo State have endorsed the governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA), Ugwumba Uche Nwosu. At a rally in Owerri, yesterday, the group maintained that their stand was taken after a thorough analysis of the character and antecedents of the various candidates contesting the election in the state. Chairman of the association, Comrade Peter Udogu, noted that Nwosu had distinguished himself among other candidates as the most people-oriented, stressing that he was much more committed to youth and women empowerment than any of the other candidates. In his response, Nwosu said the propelling force in his ambition was the support of the masses, adding that he would not have continued with his ambition to govern the state if he wasnâ€™t sure of their support.
