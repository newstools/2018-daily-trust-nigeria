The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria, Dr. Obiageli Ezekwesili, has pledged to tackle poverty in Nigeria with a view to reduce it to the barest level if elected president in the 2019 general elections. Dr. Ezekwesili made the pledge during a courtesy visit by “Women in Politics Organisation” to her campaign office in Abuja on Thursday. She said her government would mainstream gender-related issues, especially as it concerns the welfare of women and the girl-child. While acknowledging that poverty cannot be completely eradicated from the society, she promised to work hard to minimize it through inclusive economic growth and job creation for the youth. Ezekwesili said that being a woman does not pose a challenge for her to win the presidential election, stressing that she was keen on giving dividends of democracy to all Nigerians. “The unemployment figure in the country is scaring and a huge number of graduates come into the labour market every year. Some will argue that gender equality is a deal that cannot be achieved, but I disagree because the society is already moving in that direction”, she said. While promising to put in place policies targeted at empowering women to tackle poverty as well as establish a sustainable financial system that would address discrimination against women, Ezekwesili said: “I will ensure good representation, poverty alleviation and good economic policy for the development of the economy.” She called on youths in the country to shun all forms of vices, and not to allow themselves to be used by politicians before, during and after the general elections.
