A 23-year-old sales girl has landed in trouble for allegedly converting N300,000 sales proceeds belonging to her employer to her ownership. The police last Friday charged Miss Onyinyechi Theophilous with stealing before chief magistrate Adedoja Ojo of the Igbosere magistrate court, Lagos. The police alleged that on December 24, 2018, Miss Theophilous’ employer, Obinna Kelvin Okeke, gave her N300,000 in his boutique shop at No. GD4, Oluwole Plaza, Lagos Island, with instruction to her to deposit the money in his Sterling Bank account. But, according to the police, the accused neither deposited the money in Okeke’s account nor returned it to him. Rather, when she returned to the boutique, she claimed that the money had been stolen from her by unknown persons. Theophilous, however, pleaded not guilty and was admitted to bail, while further hearing has been fixed for January 9, 2019.
