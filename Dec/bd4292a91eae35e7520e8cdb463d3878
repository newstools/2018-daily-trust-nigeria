The President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Mr Paul Usoro (SAN), has arrived the Federal High Court in Lagos for his scheduled arraignment. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission accused Usoro of converting and laundering a sum of N1.4bn. The charge sheet, marked FHC/418c/18, was filed before Justice Muslim Hassan. In the charge, the EFCC claimed that Usoro converted and laundered the money in connivance with the governor of his state, Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State. The EFCC claimed that Usoro in connivance with the others, conspired among themselves to commit the offence sometime in 2015 “within the jurisdiction of this honourable court”. The anti-graft agency claimed that the N1.4bn allegedly converted and laundered by the defendants belonged to the Akwa Ibom State Government. Counsel for the EFCC, Rotimi Oyedepo, who signed the charge sheet, said in the charge sheet the offence allegedly committed by the NBA President was contrary to Section 18 (a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011.
