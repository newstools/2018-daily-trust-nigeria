The Sisters of Jannah (SOJ), a Muslim women humanitarian Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) has empowered 2,000 widows and indigent women with N100,000 each to invest in small-scale businesses. The national coordinator of the organisation, Mrs Ramatu Aliyu, made this known at the launch of SOJ 2018 on Saturday in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the theme of the event was ‘Charity, a Path to Jannah’. Aliyu said the empowerment was part of efforts by the group to ensure the actualisation of the ECOWAS Vision 2020 adopted by heads of states and governments. She said the organisation resolved to assist poor women and disadvantaged groups through empowerment and in the area of medical care, education and skills acquisition. She added that within three years of its existence, the organisation had recorded some achievements in all facets of human endeavour, including facilitating the release of some inmates. She restated the determination of the group towards eliminating public misconceptions about Islam and Muslims, as well as promoting authentic Islamic spirit, belief, values and culture. In a lecture titled ‘Challenging Stereotype, Changing Perception on Polygamy,’ Dr Abdulfattah Adeyemi, said it was not mandatory for every Muslim to practice polygamy, unless if he would be fair and just. Adeyemi, who is the founder of Baynakum Family Counselling Centre, Abuja, said polygamy was put in place to favour women, not men. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Blue IVY Medical Centre offered free medical tests to participants at the event to mark three years of Sisters of Jannah.
