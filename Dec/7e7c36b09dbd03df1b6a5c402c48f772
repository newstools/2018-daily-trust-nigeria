A former leader of Madagascar, Andry Rajoelina, has won the country’s presidential run-off vote, electoral authorities say. He won nearly 56% to defeat another former president, Marc Ravalomanana.Both candidates had previously promised to accept the result. However Mr Ravalomanana – who was ousted by Mr Rajoelina in a coup almost 10 years ago – has since made allegations of what he calls “massive fraud”. Mr Ravalomanana did not attend the electoral commission’s results announcement, made amid high security in the capital Antananarivo. The constitutional court now has nine days to decide whether to confirm the commission’s results. During the first round of the election, Mr Rajoelina took 39% of the vote and Mr Ravalomanana 35%. Both candidates had promised to boost the economy in a country where 75% of the population live in poverty. Outgoing president Hery Rajaonarimampianina was eliminated in the first round, getting just 9% of the vote.
