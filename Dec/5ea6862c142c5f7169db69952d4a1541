ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) has rejected a plan by the Federal Government to divert about ₦N121 bn of the funds allocated to the National Social Investments Programme (NSIP) to the 2019 general elections. The AAN Country Director, Ene Obi said, yesterday, in Abuja that as an organisation involved in coordination of third party monitoring of the NSIP, it lamented government’s challenges and poor planning that has led it to consider tampering with funds meant for a programme that has touched the lives of several impoverished Nigerians. According to her, several youths who would have been otherwise unemployed have had their livelihood enhanced with work as N-Agro, N-Build, N-Health and N-Tax beneficiaries and that the number of N-Teach beneficiaries who find hope in imparting knowledge on children in public schools and in turn receive a stipend of ₦N30,000 for a full month’s work, leaves one with a strong desire to see more youths empowered to uplift more Nigerians from poverty. She said rather than using the NSIP funds for the 2019 elections, the president should work with the legislature and seek creative ways of sourcing funds for the elections. She said, “We appeal, that Nigeria must not continue to use that which is meant for the poor but rather find more ways of creating opportunities to lift people out of poverty.” N-Power: NSIP begins training of beneficiaries in Adamawa FG commits N500bn to poverty alleviation FG disengages 7 N-Power beneficiaries in Adamawa
