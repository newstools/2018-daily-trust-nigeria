The threat by Major Petroleum Marketers and Private Deport Owners to embark on strike over outstanding subsidy claims was a calculated attempt to sabotage government’s efforts to developing the sector. Speaking with journalists on Sunday in Minna, the chairman Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) Minna depot, Comrade Adamu Erana,  said the planned strike was self-serving, while disassociating  his association from the move. According to him, the threat to embark on strike two months to election was suspicious, adding that the move was the handiwork of those who want to cause confusion and disrupt the election. “The best they can do is to go on dialogue with the federal government, not just creating issues that will cause chaos and hardship to the people. There is clear indication that some people are using the depot owners to sabotage government. If you look at it critically, you will discover that all the products the depot owners are selling are imported by government. The depot owners do not import even a litre of fuel,” he noted. He faulted the claim that the federal government has not paid subsidy since inception, adding that “we should be reminded that the federal government paid us subsidies but there were some outstanding balances”. He said private depot owners must be reminded that they were not the importers of the products but only engaged in the storage of the products in their facilities, adding that they should not be the ones requesting for subsidy payments. He urged the National Assembly to take the position of mediators in the matter rather than taking sides with any of the parties.
