A Karmo Grade I Area Court, Abuja, has sentenced a labourer to two months in prison for stealing one roll of sachet Cowbell powdered milk, a carton of Vaseline Blue Seal and one crate of eggs. The judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, found Abdulahi Danjuma of no fixed address guilty of house breaking and theft. Maiwada, however gave the convict an option to pay a fine of N5, 000 while warning him to desist from committing crime. The judge ordered that the milk be returned to the owner. The prosecutor, Mrs Ukagha Ijeoma, told the court that two traders Israel Abraham and Mohammed Sani all of NNPC Quarters Life Camp, Abuja, reported the matter at the Life Camp Police Station on December 3. The prosecutor, told the court that the convict broke into Saniâ€™s shop and stole a carton of Vaseline Blue Seal, one roll of Cowbell powder milk, and one crate of egg all valued N5, 000. Ijeoma said that the convict was apprehended and handed over to the police immediately. She said that during police investigation and interrogation, the convict admitted to committing the offence and one roll of powder milk was recovered from him. The prosecutor said the offence contravened sections 354 and 287 of the Penal Code. The convict pleaded guilty to the charges and begged court for leniency. Ijeoma, therefore, urged the court to invoke Section 347 of the Administration of Criminal Justices Act, 2015 on summary trial. (NAN)
