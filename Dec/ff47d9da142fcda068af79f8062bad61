  Wigwe made the clarification at a joint press briefing by both banks at the head office of the Access Bank in Lagos on Wednesday. He said: “It will be inappropriate to compare what happened in the time of Intercontinental Bank and Diamond Bank. Intercontinental was managed by the CBN. “What we are seeing  is a combination of our talent pool because the compelling proposition is Diamond Bank’s strong retail structure and unparalleled digital footprint.” He said under the new arrangement, Diamond retail structure and its management will move into Access Bank. “It is not a function of asking people to go. We will re-skill and ensure we are offering uniform services across board,” Wigwe assured.
