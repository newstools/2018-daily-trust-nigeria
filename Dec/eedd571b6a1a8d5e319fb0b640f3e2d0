The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organisation (PPCO) has said it uncovered plans by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Presidency to arrest  National Assembly members who booed President Muhammadu Buhari during his 2019 budget presentation last Wednesday. The PPCO spokesman, Buba Galadima, who addressed newsmen yesterday in Abuja, claimed that the presidency had directed security agencies to start compiling names of lawmakers who jeered Buhari for arrest. “We learnt under an impeccable authority that some of his close aides are meeting and taking names of those  who supposedly booed the president whether to frame them with EFCC or ask the police to invite them. I don’t know for what purpose,” Galadima alleged. “They can’t arrest any parliamentarian for booing the president on what he thinks is correct; that the president misrepresented what has happened in his or her constituency. They should be careful with what they are trying to do, because…Whether the president knows or he doesn’t know will affect the 2019 general elections. “He has no authority whatsoever or his agents whether EFCC, ICPC, Police and DSS to accost any parliamentarian for having booed the president over what he read out on the floor of the National Assembly,” he said. Galadima also declared that “Over 90 per cent of the president’s claims in the budget were false.” The PDP spokesman also accused the President of breaching the Electoral Act by collecting donations from the Nigerian Farmers Association for the purpose of campaign.
