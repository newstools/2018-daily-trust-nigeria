The PDP Youth Leader in Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Bello, has faulted the claim by Governor Nasir El-Rufai that the people who attended the rally of Atiku Abubakar in Sokoto State were hired from Niger Republic. Bello, in a statement yesterday said whether el-Rufai liked it or not, the rally marked the funeral of APC in the North West and the country as a whole. “El-Rufai has every reason to fear and kick against his obvious fall by even conceding that our border control under the watch of APC has become so lose, porous and useless that  such a sea of humans could cross from Niger Republic to Nigeria under a few hours unchallenged. “He has even at one time claimed on a national television that the criminals killing and maiming innocent people in his state are foreigners from Niger whom he has severally paid compensation to stop the killings. In some climes, such claims by an APC figure like El-Rufai will amount to a national scandal that will bring down the party from power,” he said. Bello said the PDP was sure of reclaiming Kaduna next year, saying “Kaduna State under the watch of El-Rufai’s APC has not only become the most backward in northern Nigeria in terms of ruinous infrastructure,  but has the most  despondent citizenry and is the most unsafe place to live in Nigeria compared to where the PDP conceded power to the APC in 2015.”
