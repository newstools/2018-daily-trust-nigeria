A middle-aged man who allegedly killed his friend over a piece of dog meat has been charged with murder before a Lagos High Court. The case, which is pending before Justice Coker at the Ikeja High Court, has been fixed for February 19, 2019 for trial. The defendant, 27-year-old Sunday Hycient, who pleaded not guilty, was alleged to have committed the offence on December 30, 2016 around the Festac Link Bridge, Lagos, when he unlawfully killed one Onwe Ozoemelem by hitting him in the chest with fist blows. It was gathered that the traders at the scene got a tricycle to convey Ozoemelem to the hospital, where he was confirmed dead. The defendant, who is a welder, was immediately apprehended and handed over to the police. A witness told the court that trouble began for Hycient when a friend, Ifeanyi, bought dog meat of N500 to be shared by a group of friends at the gathering. Daily Trust learnt that as the dog meat was being passed round, Hycient was about to take a piece of dog meat but the deceased grabbed the same piece of dog meat from him. The duo were said to have started dragging the meat until they were separated by their friends. Shortly after, the deceased was said to have started complaining of chest pain and died before getting to the hospital.
