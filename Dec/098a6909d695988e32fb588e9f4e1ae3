Senate President Bukola Saraki has expressed sadness over the death of the first elected President of Nigeria, Alhaji Shehu Shagari who he described as the last of the First and Second Republic titans. Saraki in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in Ilorin, described the late Shagari as a man of peace who dedicated the greater part of his life to the service of the fatherland. He noted that Shagari would be remembered for his immense contributions to the political and socio-economic development of the country as well as his peaceful disposition. He also commiserated with the immediate and larger family of the deceased, the government and people of Sokoto State, and the entire country over the loss of the former president. “Let’s be consoled by the fact that Alhaji Shagari lived his life in the service of God and country. He was a quintessential public servant, having served in seven cabinet positions and as a legislator. He was the first elected president who was chief executive of the country. He dedicated his best years in the service of our nation and its people and will be dearly missed.” Saraki prayed to Allah to grant the soul of the late Shagari a place among the righteous ones in Aljannah Firdaus and his family, loved ones and the entire country the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
