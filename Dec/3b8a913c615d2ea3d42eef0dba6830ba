The National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has promised to urge President Muhammadu Buhari to “quickly” give assent to the Discrimination Against Persons With Disabilities Bill so that it becomes a law following its last week’s passage by the National Assembly. Oshiomhole was represented by the APC National Treasurer, Adamu Fanda, at a rally to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities and support President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election bid in 2019. Fanda said the APC gave special recognition to the persons with disabilities by ensuring that they were constitutionally empowered to become part of the party leadership at various levels in recognition of their population in the country. “We, the APC, are the only all-inclusive party that believes that everybody is endowed whether you are disable or able. We give you a level playing ground. Our party is a mass-oriented party. It is meant for the poor and majority of Nigerians. “This is because we know that we have a large number of people with disability. That is why we provide special positions for them in the party. Whatever they do, we have to come and identify with them and share in their glory,” he said. The APC National Disability Leader, Misbahu Lawan Didi, who organised the rally, said it was packaged to appreciate President Buhari and the APC as a party on what they had done to the lives of persons with disabilities. Didi, who is a member of the APC National Working Committee (NWC), said about 40,000 persons with disabilities were currently serving as leaders of the party at various levels. He expressed strong belief that President Buhari would give assent to the disabilities bill to become law.
