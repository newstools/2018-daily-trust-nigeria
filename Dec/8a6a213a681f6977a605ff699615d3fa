The governorship candidate of the APC in Delta State, Great Ogboru, has said PDP can no longer claim sole ownership of his home State since time has changed. Ogboru, who said this while fielding questions from journalists, stated that there was progress in the APC in his state following the constitution of the reconciliation committee and the intervention of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who advised them to put their house in order to achieve victory in 2019. When asked about his chances as he was contesting with a formidable opponent in a place considered a PDP state, Ogboru said, “I have heard people saying Delta State is a PDP State; that is highly untrue because majority and a very significant number of our people are not PDP compliant. Most of the people in Delta State, the electorate, have been opposed by the PDP government for the past 16 years, maybe for the past 19 years. “But as you all know, the PDP had been able to sustain itself in many parts of our country, Delta State inclusive, by means other than true or proper votes of the electorate. That is history now, time has changed, circumstances have changed, the powers have changed, the leadership of our country has changed and the thinking of our people across the country generally has also changed.” Oshiomhole, Ogboru and the shoe-shiner Delta re-run: Uduaghan fights the battle of his life 2019: Utomi rejects INEC list, may consider SDP ticket
