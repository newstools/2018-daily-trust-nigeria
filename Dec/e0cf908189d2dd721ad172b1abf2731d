Eleven soldiers are currently facing trial in the General Court Martial inaugurated on Monday by the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 82 Division of the Nigerian Army, Enugu, Maj-Gen Emmanuel Kabuk. The soldiers are being prosecuted for various offences ranging from insubordination, incompletion of task and general indiscipline. Gen. Kabuk, who inaugurated the 8-member General Court Martial at the Abakpa, Enugu Cantonment of the Division, said the move was to instil discipline among soldiers in the Division. “This General Court Martial is meant to instil discipline among the soldiers and officers of the Division. Discipline is needed to achieve relentless professionalism, which is the target of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Tukur Burutai. “So, the inauguration today, goes in-line with COAS vision to reposition the Nigerian Army for effectiveness and responsiveness,’’  he said. The GOC, however, assured the soldiers standing trail that the court would ensure fairness and grant them fair-hearing to them. Kabuk added that the military court would ensure a fair justice for all – including the accused, the Nigerian Army and the victims. Responding, President of the General Court Martial, Col. Edward Abore, assured that the 8-member court would abide by the Nigerian Army law and the 1999 Constitution as amended. “I will assure the accused persons (soldiers) of justice in this court. So, I will implore the accused not to fear or panic as the court will be fair to all parties involved,” he said.
