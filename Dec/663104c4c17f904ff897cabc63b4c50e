Religion leaders, including the Imams, are encouraging corruption in the society for not shunning people of such character among their followers. The Comptroller General (CG) of the Nigerian Customs Service, Hammed Ali made this claim during a seminar organised by the Committee of FCT Imams Initiative, (CFII) for its members in Abuja, on Saturday. The Customs CG, who was among the dignitaries invited to make presentation, opined that the religious leaders could play a better role in fighting the menace by not giving respect and honour to corrupt people in the society. “Certainly, you must imbibe that in your speech and deeds as we don’t have a choice but to follow suit in order to succeed in the fight against corruption” Ali emphasized. Earlier in his address, the guest lecturer in the event, Professor Auwalu Yadudu of the Bayero University Kano, tasked the Imams to get as a source of income rather than relying on charity. Prof Yadudu, who was represented by the forum’s Amir Sheikh Tajuddeen Bello, the Imam of the Wuse community jumma’at mosque Abuja, said such step would shield them from corruption.
