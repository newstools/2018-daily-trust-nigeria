The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections, Atiku Abubakar, has denied appointing a foreigner simply identified as David Pride as his social media consultant. In a statement signed on Monday and made available to newsmen by Atiku’s media aide, Paul Ibe, the former Vice President said David Pride is an ‘impostor and unknown to him.’ The statement read: “A certain David Pride who claims to have been contracted by the Atiku Campaign and announced himself as a media consultant is an impostor unknown to His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar. “Please disregard, his claim is false.” Daily Trust recalls that one David Pride had last Friday announced via his handle: @DavidaPride on Twitter that he had been contracted as a social media consultant to the PDP’s presidential candidate.
