Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state has assured citizens of the state that the anti-open grazing law would not be compromised if he is re-elected into office on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ortom made the remark on Monday during the PDP state campaign flag-off at the IBB Square in Makurdi. “We assure the Benue people that, on this platform (PDP), our law will not be compromised and that in due course, the benefits of ranching shall be felt by all. “This is the platform on which we seek the renewal of our mandate. No one will bend us as far as the Ranching Law is concerned because we draw consent and sustained support from the Benue people,” he said. The governor stressed that the Benue masses on whose behalf and on whose behest the ranching law was passed and signed into law by his administration, are witnesses to various attempts by highly placed officials in the APC-led Federal Government to frustrate an imperative legislation aimed at finding lasting peace between farmers and herders in the state. He therefore added that it became pertinent for him to make a bold political decision on the choice of platform that would not compromise the state’s stance on a matter so key to the Benue people, hence, his return to the PDP. “Let us vote to keep our home for us and for our children; let us unite with one voice and reject all manoeuvres aimed at putting Benue in the hands of individuals with questionable motives who would always pander to the whims of external interests. “In this election, we must not empower men unwilling to give voice and recognition to our pains; we must not elevate those who will twist the true narratives of our misfortunes for favours. If we do, we would have lost the voice to tell the world our story,” Ortom added.
