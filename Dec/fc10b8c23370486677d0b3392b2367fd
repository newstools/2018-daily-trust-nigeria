Justice Sunday Aladetoyinbo  of the Federal Capital Territory High Court sitting in Maitama, Abuja yesterday, admitted a dismissed police officer, Gabriel Achimi, to bail in the sum of N5 million. Achimi, 37, is charged with the murder of one Ishaku Musa, a commercial motorcycle rider around Gishiri junction, Abuja. Justice Aladetoyinbo granted bail to Achimi after the prosecutor, Ms Munrat Suleiman, informed the court that the police was yet to transfer the case file to the Ministry of Justice. Aladetoyinbo also ordered the defendant to produce one surety who must be a public servant residing in the FCT. He then adjourned the case until Feb. 28 for commencement of trial. Earlier, Mr Akin Akintan, the defence counsel, told the court that the defendant could not be kept in detention perpetually. Akintan noted that the prosecution had been granted adjournments severally with the same excuses. “The prosecution and witnesses are not ready for this case; we are in a circle of motionlessness, the defendant should be discharged or granted bail,” he prayed. The police on Feb. 27, had alleged that on May 10, 2017 at about 8pm, Achimi shot Musa, around Gishiri junction, Abuja. They alleged that the act led to the death of the deceased. The police in the charge said the action contravened Section 224 of the Penal Code. The defendant had pleaded not guilty. (NAN)
