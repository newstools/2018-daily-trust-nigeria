The budget presentation by President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, ended rowdiness. The rowdiness ensued at the end of the president’s presentation when both members of the All Progressive Party, APC and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP were involved in a shouting match, while trying to cheer and jeer the president at the same time. The action of the lawmakers forced an abrupt end to the event, preventing both Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara from delivering their speeches at the end of the presentation. The lawmakers from both sides had, during Buhari’s presentation, made attempts to outweigh one another in cheering and jeering the president. At some point, a lawmaker interrupted Buhari’s presentation by tempering with sound system using his own microphone.
