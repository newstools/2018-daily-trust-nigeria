Alhaji Shehu Shagari, who died at the National Hospital, Abuja last night at the age of 94, was President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the entire four years and three months of the Second Republic, 1979-83. He was elected to the top job in August 1979 on the platform of the National Party of Nigeria, NPN, which elected him as its flagbearer in November 1978.

Even before that, Shagari had a distinguished career of service to the country at Native Authority, Sokoto Provincial, Northern Regional, North Western State, Federal, Yabo Local Government, Sokoto State and again at the federal levels. His date of birth at his native Shagari village in Sokoto State was once placed at February 1925 but he later changed it to December 1924, based on a visit to Sokoto of his father at the time he was born. His father Aliyu was the Magajin Shagari, i.e. village. He died five years after Shagari’s birth, and the future president was then brought up by his elder brother Muhamamdu bello, who died in 1984.

He entered politics in 1951 and was the secretary of the Northern Peoples Congress [NPC] in Sokoto Province.

He was also the Chairman of Sokoto Urban Development Authority [SUDA], which built the new Sokoto market. As President, Shagari pursued NPN’s manifesto of “Food and Shelter.” It was in pursuit of that that he launched the Green Revolution program in 1980 and also built what became known as the Shagari Housing Estates in all state capitals of the time. Oil prices plummeted in 1981 and forced him to declare the “austerity” measures. Shortly after he won a second term in 1983, soldiers overthrew the Second Republic. He was in detention for several years, after which he returned to live a quite life in Sokoto and Shagari. He held the traditional title of Turakin Sokoto from 1962 until his passing last night, and was appointed a full-time member of the Sultan’s Council in 1996.
