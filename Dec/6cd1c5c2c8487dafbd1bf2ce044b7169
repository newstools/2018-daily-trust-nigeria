The presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has alleged that despite the biting unemployment and unprecedented level of insecurity in the country, President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration “is spending money like drunken sailors through Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.” Atiku, in a statement yesterday by his Special Assistant on Public Communication, Phrank Shaibu, accused the government of “shelling out billions of taxpayers’ funds on Tradermoni, a crafty scheme to buy voters ahead of next year’s polls.” He said government was clueless on the way out of the unemployment problem in the country. Reacting to the latest report of the National Bureau of Statistics for the third quarter of 2018 with the unemployment rate rising from 18.8 per cent in the third quarter of to 23.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, he said the hopes for better governance and improved standard of living that many had nursed with the assumption of office by Buhari in May 2015 had since given way to despair and hopelessness.
