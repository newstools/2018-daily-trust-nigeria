A member of the PDP in the House of Representatives said, yesterday, that the jeering of President Muhammadu Buhari by members of the opposition party was not to slight him and his office but to draw his attention to the situation on ground. Rep Kingsley Chinda (PDP, Rivers), who was at the forefront of jeering and booing the president, told Daily Trust in Abuja, yesterday, that they did not intend to jeer the president. Daily Trust reports that Chinda ‎particularly interrupted the president’s presentation through microphone whenever Buhari listed some of the projects executed by the administration. “In the House, we have people who believe that Mr President should be given another four years, and we have people that believe he shouldn’t be allowed another four years. “You could see that Mr President began receiving cheers, which wasn’t supposed to be. When he read out projects, you saw people clapping, when those things are not in our constituencies. “What happened yesterday wasn’t to slight the person of the president. Nobody would have wanted to do that because we respect the office of the president. Who knows whether one of us will occupy the office one day? “Mr President couldn’t have gone to all the projects sites to see that the projects were done. But after yesterday’s presentation, I’m sure he would ask questions about the implementation. “If we had not done that, the president would have thought that everything was okay, but that’s not true. The projects he was reading out, he is supposed to know what happened. Do we keep quiet when he was mentioning all those projects when we know that it’s not true?” he asked.
