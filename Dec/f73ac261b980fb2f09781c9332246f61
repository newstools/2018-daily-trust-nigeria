The Kwara State High Court, yesterday, recognised the executive committee of the Isola Balogun-Fulani faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state.Balogun-Fulani and other APC leaders in his team are ardent supporters of Senate President Bukola Saraki who had defected to the PDP leaving them behind. But counsel to the Bashir Bolarinwa faction of the party, Kamaldeen Gambari, which is loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said  they were not satisfied with the judgement, adding that the court acted contrary to the facts placed before it. Gambari, who said the judgement would not stand, added that he had already filed an appeal against the judgement by the High Court, and expressed hope that the appeal court would upturn the judgement. In a judgement read by Justice T.S. Umar which lasted for about one and half hours, the court held that the purported dissolution of the executive committee of the APC led by Balogun-Fulani was illegal, null and void. The judgement further held that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should recognize the list of members of the executive committee presented by the Kwara APC executive committee led by the Balogun-Fulani faction. Speaking with journalists after the court sitting, counsel to the Isola Balogun-Fulani faction of the APC, Abdulazeez Ibrahim, said no cost was awarded for the judgement secured since they did not ask for any. Ibrahim also said the effect of the judgement was that the court recognised candidates of the Balogun-Fulani faction of the APC “since it’s the authentic executive committee of the state.” APC: Sacked Ishola Balogun-Fulani-led Kwara exco remain expelled Kwara: Court declares Ishola Fulani-led APC excos authentic Court sacks Rivers APC exco, nullifies primaries
