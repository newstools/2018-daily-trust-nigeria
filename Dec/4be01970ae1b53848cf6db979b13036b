Nigeria’s oldest airline, Aero Contractors has launched training school to end dearth of skilled manpower in the aviation industry. The training school which would start in January was launched by the company after obtaining Approved Training Organisation (ATO) licence from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). Aero said the school would kick off with the training of cabin crew and dispatchers and later other courses would be added to the curriculum, adding it would partner with the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria and other international institutions to give Nigeria the best skilled manpower for the industry. CEO of Aero Contractors, Captain Ado Sanusi said, “We have just got Aviation Training Organisation license. We have been on this for a long time because we wanted to get it right; we wanted to make sure we have a training organisation that is based on a solid foundation, which can be grown into a centre of excellence.
