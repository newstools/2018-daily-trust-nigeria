The House of Representatives has commenced Wednesday’s plenary without the constitutional requirement for a quorum of one-third of the 360-member House. Section 54(1) of the 1999 Constitution stipulates that “The quorum of the Senate or of the House of Representatives shall be one-third of all the members of any of the Legislative House concerned.” For the House of Representatives, this means that at least 120 members of the total 360 lawmakers are required to form a quorum before a legislative business could be conducted. However, at the time of commencement of Wednesday’s plenary, only 30 members were seated at the green chamber. Raising concern over the issue, House Leader Femi Gbajabiamila said although the House leadership was aware of the constitutional provisions on quorum, the plenary should proceed given the events of the previous day. According to him: “Granted that there is a constitutional provision for quorum to conduct the legislative business, we shall not lose sight of the events of yesterday.” Recall that protesting National Assembly workers yesterday picketed both the Senate and House of Representatives, and thus prevented the lawmakers from sitting.
