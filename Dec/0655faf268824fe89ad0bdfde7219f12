A former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Bamanga Tukur, has asked the Federal Government and all Nigerians to work together in order to end the “senseless killings” in the country which, he said, remains a threat to successful polls in 2019. Tukur, an elder statesman who addressed a press conference, yesterday, in his Abuja residence, said government should stop the incessant killings by ensuring there was equity,  justice, fair play and bringing the perpetrators as well as their sponsors to book. He advised the political class to play by the rules of the game and cautioned against politicising security issues in the country. “The killing is a threat to the 2019 general elections and we should not go there at all; we should steer away from it. The government and all Nigerians must end the senseless killings,” Tukur said. “It is good for us to conduct ourselves in a peaceful manner in order to guarantee a peaceful election. “My opinion may differ on the way we are governed or the way we should be governed but democracy and rule of law are central to peace and security of the nation so all politicians and leaders should preach peace to their followers,” he added. “Only peace can unite us and only a united Nigeria can take us to the Promised Land. Why all these disconnect? Why all these conflicts? Why all these killings? Have we forgotten we are one nation?” he queried.
