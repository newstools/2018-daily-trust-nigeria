The FCT Administration (FCTA) has unveiled new procedures for conducting legal search on landed property in the territory to curb fraud and abuses. The FCT Director of Land Administration, Adamu Jibrin Hussaini, disclosed this at the weekend in his office while addressing some senior staff of the department. He said applicants would henceforth write and make three copies of application to conduct legal search, addressed to the director of lands. “But for corporate organizations and companies, applications must carry the RC Number (Corporate Affairs Registration Number), while lawyers handling such transactions must affix their Nigerian Bar Association seals (NBA seals),”he said. He added that “all applications must have photocopies of title document(s) attached while the original(s) must be brought for sighting with the person presenting the title document producing valid identification like International Passport or Driver’s License or Voter’s Card,” Hussaini added. He said relevant original title documents such as Certificate of Occupancy, Right of Occupancy and recertification of acknowledgement letter must be presented. He, therefore, advised that any person wishing to do any transaction on any property either developed or undeveloped within the 8,000 square kilometers of the FCT should come forward to conduct legal search or visit the ultra-modern customer service at AGIS, No. 4, Peace Drive, Central Business District, Abuja to avoid being scammed by fraudsters.
