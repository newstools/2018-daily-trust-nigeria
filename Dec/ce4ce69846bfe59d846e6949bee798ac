Loyalists of Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State, yesterday, dominated the campaign committee of the governorship candidate of Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Adekunle Akinlade, ahead of the 2019 election in the state. A former minister of Mines and Steel Development, Sarafa Tunji Ishola, was named as the director general, while the deputy DG is the serving commissioner for Health, Dr. Babatunde Ipaye. The commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Jide Ojuko, will serve as Ogun West zonal director. Others were Toyin Ayebusiwa who was named Ogun East campaign director and Wole Adesiji, Ogun Central campaign director. Daily Trust reports that the governor’s anointed candidate, alongside other loyalists, had pulled out of the APC over disputed gubernatorial and legislative houses tickets. Amosun who stayed put in the ruling party, however, vowed to work for Akinlade’s victory in the next election. Speaking, yesterday, at the unveiling of the APM campaign committee, inauguration of office and flag-off at newly constructed office along Leme, Abeokuta road, the campaign DG disclosed that APM did not field any candidate for Ogun Central, where Amosun is contesting as APC candidate. Ishola, who was Secretary to the State Government during Gbenga Daniel’s administration, also expressed APM’s readiness to support President Muhammadu Buhari’s election in 2019. The APM governorship candidate said they were compelled to join the party “in search of justice, internal democracy and the sustenance of the mission to rebuild Ogun State.” Ogun 2019: It is battle between APC and APM Abiodun hopeful of Amosun’s endorsement in APC I’m still in APC–Amosun
