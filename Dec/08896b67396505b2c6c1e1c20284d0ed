The chairman, Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN), Princess Vicky Haastrup, has lamented how bad roads and the menacing Apapa gridlock has resulted in huge loss of revenue. The chairman put the losses incurred by terminal operators in the last quarter of the year at about 40 per cent. Haastrup described the gridlock and bad roads, particularly in Lagos State, as a monumental national disgrace. She said the situation is frustrating operations at the nation’s seaports. Haastrup, who spoke in her office weekend, said terminal operators are working under the harshest business environment, in spite of the huge investments they have made towards developing the ports. The STOAN chairman wondered why successive governments in the country allowed the port access roads to progressively degenerate until they became impassable. She said, “The situation in Apapa particularly as it relates to access to the port is a monumental national disgrace. How can a sector that has such huge potential and that generates billions of naira for government be left to so degenerate? Government is looking for oil but we have a sector that has the capacity to give you all the revenue you need yet the sector is suffering.
