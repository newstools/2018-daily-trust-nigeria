The Labour Party (LP) has flagged off its gubernatorial campaign and presentation of flags to candidates of various positions in the forthcoming elections in Benue State. Also, the party during the exercise in Makurdi on Tuesday decried the high level of poverty in the country, urging Nigerians to elected credible candidates with the interest of the ordinary people at heart in 2019. The Deputy National Chairman of LP in North Central, Comrade Shirsha Adi, stressed the need for Nigerians to support his party into government so that it would rescue the country from the shackles of poverty. “As a people-oriented political platform, Labour Party is a party for all Nigerians irrespective of your social status. It is a party where no one dominates the other. “In Labour Party, we have no godfathers and godmothers. No single individual runs the affairs of the party from his bedroom. Hence, the party will lead the state for all and not for the benefit of any single individual,” he said. On his part, the governorship candidate of LP in Benue, Dr. Paul Angya, noted that the party was bound for victory in the coming election as he appealed to all Benue indigenes to join the train in order to pull the state out of the doldrums of poverty, lack of industries and dilapidated infrastructure.
