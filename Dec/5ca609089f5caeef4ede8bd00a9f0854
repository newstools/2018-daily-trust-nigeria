Religion leaders including the Imams were accused of encouraging corruption by not shunning people of such character among their followers. The Comptroller- General, Nigerian Customs Service, (NCS) Col. Hammed Ali (rtd) made the remark at a seminar organised by the Committee of FCT Imams Initiative, (CFII) in Abuja, on Saturday. He said religious leaders could play a better role in fighting corruption by simply stop giving respect and honour to the people who were found to be corrupt in the society. “Certainly, you must imbibe that in your speech and deeds as we don’t have a choice but to follow suit in order to succeed in the fight against corruption,” Ali emphasised. Earlier, the guest lecturer, Professor Auwalu Yadudu of the Bayero University, Kano, tasked the Imams to have other sources of their income and to avoid absolutely relying on charity. Professor Yadudu, represented by the forum’s Amir, Sheikh Tajuddeen Bello, the Imam of the Wuse Community Jumma’at Mosque, Abuja, said such step would shield them against becoming corrupt themselves.
