At the media unveiling held in Lagos, the Managing Director of Promasidor Nigeria, Anders Einarsson, said the new products would lead to both direct and indirect job creation for the farmers who produce the raw materials, while stressing that 75 per cent of the entire materials for Sunvita was locally sourced. “The locally sourced materials demonstrate our commitment to backward integration and local capacity utilization in line with the economic need of the country.
