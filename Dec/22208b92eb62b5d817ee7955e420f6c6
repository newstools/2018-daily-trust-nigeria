The Bollywood star, who married US singer Nick Jonas in Rajasthan state over the weekend, unveiled her intricately-detailed wedding dress in an Instagram post on Wednesday. The Ralph Lauren-designed dress had more than two million mother-of-pearl sequins sewed into it, but it was the veil that stole the show. Jonas and Chopra got engaged in the summer after a whirlwind romance. Naturally, the internet had a lot to say about her veil, which was so large it needed a small team of people to carry it.
