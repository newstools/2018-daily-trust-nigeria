The late President died without having malice against anybody as he had forgiven all who offended him before his death, according to his eldest son, Bala Shagari. “Some people were alleging that he nursed some grudges against some people but this is not truth. He has forgiven everybody before his death and the only reason why he was not attending functions was because of his Ill-health as he hardly goes out for some period,” he said. In an interview with newsmen at the residence of the late former President in Sokoto  town, Bala said his father had not left any will apart from where he should be buried after his death.

According to him, there was an offer from the Sultan that the remains of the late President should be buried at the Hubbare cemetery but for his will which must be respected. He added that there was no last word from his father as he had stopped talking for a long period of time due poor health. Bala noted that the onus  of taking care of their family was on him now, which he could not deliver alone without the support of his other younger brothers. He prayed Allah to give him the strength to discharge this onerous responsibility efficiently and prayed Allah to forgive their late father as well as grant him Jannatul Firdaus.
