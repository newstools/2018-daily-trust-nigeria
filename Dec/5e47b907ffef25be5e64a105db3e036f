A political group, known as Atiku Abubakar Independent Volunteer Movement (ATIVM) has mobilised Nigerians in diaspora for the upcoming elections.
 
This was contained in a statement signed by Bivelina Ogar, the Kaduna State branch of ATIVM’s coordinator. She pointed out that some members of the national executives of ATIVM are Nigerians in diaspora who have been vitally involved in the mobilization of Nigerians abroad and in Nigeria to support Abubakar’s 2019 presidential candidacy. The statement read in part: “We must let ourselves know that good governance is not something we just wish for, it is something we must get up and demand for. This, we cannot do with the wrong people in power, reason why we have to get the right team there.” ATIVM under the national chairmanship of Comrade Oludare Atinsola has been taking some strides in its support for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential flag bearer Atiku Abubakar.
