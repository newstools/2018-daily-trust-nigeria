He said he was impressed with the level of maturity exhibited by the aspirants and their supporters before, during and after the chairmanship primary. The chairman added that arrangement had been put in place to reach out to all those that lost at the primary, and that that arrangement was also on top gear to call for an APC stakeholders meeting in order to ensure that the party emerged victorious in the 2019 council elections. “I can tell you that in the last chairmanship primaries, Kwali Area Council conducted the best primary devoid of any rancour or acrimony. And we are looking forward to galvanise support for the chairmanship candidate, Danladi Bomboi Chiya,” he said.
