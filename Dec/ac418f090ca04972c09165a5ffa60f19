Yemen’s warring sides held face-to-face discussions on Sunday over a planned prisoner swap, one of several confidence-building measures aimed at ending more than three years of war that has ravaged the impoverished country. Since talks began last week, UN officials have been shuttling between delegations from President Mansour Hadi’s government and the Houthi rebels. But on Sunday, officials from the Yemeni government said despite an impasse over the port of Hodeidah, a breakthrough over the release of prisoners was about to be reached following talks.
