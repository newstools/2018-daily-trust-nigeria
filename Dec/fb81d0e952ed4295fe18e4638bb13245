Popular Nigerian singers, Olamide and Lil Kesh, are currently receiving a major backlash for their new song perceived to promote ritual killings and illegal means to make money. ‘Logo Benz’ is the title of the song currently trending on social media for all the wrong reasons. Nigerians expressed their displeasure on their different social media accounts shortly after the release of the song. Here are some of the reactions If this was a country where “normal” people occupy, by now Olamide and Lil Kesh would have felt the brunt of antagonizing and attacking the fabrics of society through their songs.
