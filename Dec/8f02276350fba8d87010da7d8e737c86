Some civil society organisations have called on government and the National Assembly not to politicise education but speedy the amendment of the Universal Basic Education Act (2004) to be operational before the 2019 general elections. The Chief Operating Officer of Connected Development, Ojonwa Deborah Miachi, and the Programme Manager of Youth Hub Africa, Olusegun Medupin, while jointly addressing journalists in Abuja, said the Act has passed second reading in the House of Representatives and was referred to the committee on Basic Education and Services. “We are calling on the leadership of the House of the Representatives and the entire structure of the National Assembly, Federal Ministry of Education and President Muhammadu Buhari to rise to the occasion and amend the UBE Act without further delay,” they appealed.
