The Abakaliki Rice Mill was on Thursday night gutted by fire as stored rice and machines worth over N50million was razed down by the inferno. Daily Trust gathered that the immediate response of the state fire service stopped the fire from escalating to other buildings in the mill. The Chairman of the Abakaliki Rice Mill Ltd, Deacon Joseph Ununu, confirmed the incident on Friday, saying the fire started around 9pm. “The leadership of the mill was holding a meeting when some persons rush in to inform us that a section of the mill is on fire. We immediately contacted Ebonyi State Fire Service who rushed to the place and was able to put off the fire”, he said. Ununu, who further described the incident as mysterious, noted that some of the valuables that were salvaged were as a result of quick intervention and prompt response of the fire fighters. He explained that the fire started from the rear of the building and took over the whole structure before it was noticed by the security men on duty who then quickly alerted the authorities. “When I visited the scene, I saw stone Rice Milling machines, bags of par boiled rice and the whole roof and interior of the building completely razed,” he added. The owner of the milling shop located at 13 A Line, Mr Moses Oboh, who was in a state of shock and lamentation, urged the government to come to his aid. “l don’t think I can bear the experience and trauma of losing more than N50 million at a blow; so l’m begging the government to come to my aid”, he said. As a result of the Christmas festivities, there were high patronage and rush to purchase rice as a 25kg bag of Abakaliki rice at the mill is sold between N5,500 and N6,000.
