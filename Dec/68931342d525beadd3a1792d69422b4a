Resident Electoral Commissioner in Imo state, Prof Francis Chukwuemeka Ezeonu, has raised the alarm that some desperate politicians are bent on sabotaging the 2019 general elections by cloning the Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs in the state. Ezeonu, who spoke in Owerri during the unveiling of the Amalgamation Of Imo Professional Bodies and Associations, AIPA pleaded with the residents of the state to stop handing over their PVCs to anybody. He alleged that those engaged in the act were working hard to undermine the credibility of the election, stressing that: “Every vote will count in Imo state in 2019.” The REC said: “I have come to appeal to you to make sure that people collect their PVCs. As we speak, there are over 500,000 unclaimed PVCs in Imo state. “We have resolved to visit the about 650 communities in Imo State during this festive period to make sure that people collect their PVCs.” He added: “Our people, especially Imo people are very reluctant about elections. Some people are now cloning PVCs for the purposes of rigging elections. Let me swear to you that nobody will rig elections in Imo state. “This election that I am in charge must count. Nobody will rig elections because we are working had to ensure transparent processes. Tell your people to go and collect their PVCs.” AIPA chairman, Chief Emeka Diwe, said that the Association was working with INEC and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that the elections were credible.
