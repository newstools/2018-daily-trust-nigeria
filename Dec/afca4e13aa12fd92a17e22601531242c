A former Speaker of House of Representatives and Ogun State governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Dimeji Bankole on Tuesday vowed to make local government autonomy, a priority if he is elected the next governor of the state in the 2019 election. Bankole said this while addressing  party faithful  in Ewekoro local government area of the state . He described local governments as the fastest means through which dividends of democracy could reach the nooks and crannies of the nation. He maintained that local government autonomy would enhance employment generation, which he said is in tandem with his plans for mass employment. The gubernatorial candidate decried the undue interference in the running of local government administration  by state governments, adding that  the development would encourage  restiveness among the youth. “The local government is meant to be autonomous from the state governments. “If I am elected governor of the state in 2019, my administration will ensure local government autonomy, I will return power to the people. “The local government will be made relevant to the people at the grassroots, because they will have direct access to their allocations from the federated account,” he said.
