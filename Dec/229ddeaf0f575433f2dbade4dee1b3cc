At least 10 people have been killed in an overnight attack by a rebel group in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Local officials say suspected members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) attacked the town of Oicha in the Beni region, where they looted property and animals. The ADF, which began as a Ugandan rebel group in the 1990s, has been blamed for hundreds of killings since 2014. Insecurity in the east of Congo poses a significant threat to the elections which are due to be held in less than two weeksâ€™ time.
