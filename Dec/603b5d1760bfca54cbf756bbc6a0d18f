An emotional George W Bush has paid tribute to his father, former President George HW Bush, during a state funeral in Washington. Mr Bush Jr, himself a former president, described him as “a noble man, the best father”. All surviving US presidents attended the funeral, sharing a pew in the US National Cathedral in Washington DC. Mr Bush senior, who served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, died on Friday at the age of 94. He will be buried in his home state of Texas, alongside his wife Barbara. In his eulogy, George W Bush said his father had taught him that “public service is noble and necessary”. “He accepted failure is part of living a full life, but taught us never to be defined by failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen,” he added. His voice breaking with emotion at the end of his eulogy, Mr Bush said: “Through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you. A great and noble man, the best father a son or daughter could have.” Ex-US president George Bush dies at 94 Bush ''wondered if he''d be the last Republican president'' World leaders honor late US president George H.W.
