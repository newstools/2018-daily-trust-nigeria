A network of Sudanese journalists has started a strike in the wake of deadly protests sparked by an increase in bread prices, while opposition groups have called for further rallies. Angry crowds have taken to the streets in the capital Khartoum and several other cities since December 19, leading to a crackdown in which a number of protesters have been killed. “We declare a three-day strike from December 27 to protest against the violence unleashed by the government against demonstrators,” said the Sudanese Journalists’ Network, which advocates free speech, on Thursday.
