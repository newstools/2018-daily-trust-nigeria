The Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Most Rev. Matthew Hassan Kukah, has commiserated with President Muhammadu Buhari, the people of Sokoto State and the family of the late elder statesman and former president, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, who passed on yesterday. Kukah in a statement, said: “He was a committed patriot, dedicated to the building of a peaceful democracy. In his pursuit for dialogue, he was the first Nigerian leader to invite the Pope to visit our country in 1982, thus, laying the moral foundation for his Ethnical Revolution.” Kukah mourns Shagari Bishop Hassan Kuhah advises Buhari to tread softly on Radio Biafra’s Nnamdi Kanu Kukah to be ordained next month
