The Nigerian Air Force, NAF conducting Operation “Diran Mikiya” in Zamfara State will now engage armed criminals in the state from multiple fronts, the Chief Of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadiq Baba Abubakar has said. Abubakar Spoke during an assessment visit to Zamfara State on Wednesday. Abubakar said he was in the state to assess conduct of Operation Diran Mikiya with its headquarter in the neighbouring Katsina state. “From here, I’m proceeding to Sokoto where we will establish another quick response unit and I’m going there to look at the facilities for re-fueling of aircraft so that we can support the operation not only from Katsina but also from Sokoto axis. “We have a unit in Sokoto but it is not a flying unit. We are trying to see what we can do to immediately deploy additional personnel and equipment in Sokoto so that they can support the operation from that axis,” he said. He assured the people of the state that the Force was working round the clock to see how to bridge existing gaps that were making it possible for armed bandits and cattle rustlers to wreak havoc on the rural communities. “We will redouble our efforts in terms of intelligence because you can not fight war without intelligence. Intelligence is critical in our operations. There is no way an aircraft can spot somebody on a motorcycle, it is intelligence, therefore the role of the people is very crucial to what we are doing,” he added. In response to the remarks, the Acting governor of the state Alhaji Sanusi Garba Rikiji said it was no longer news that people were being killed and kidnapped on daily basis in the state.
