At least two Israelis have been killed and two injured in a shooting in the occupied West Bank, after Israeli forces killed three Palestinians in separate operations overnight on Wednesday. Israel’s army said on Twitter that “a Palestinian opened fire at a bus stop killing 2 Israelis, severely injuring 1 & injuring others”. Eli Bin, the head of Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency services, confirmed to Israeli Army Radio that two people were killed in the shooting. Their identities were not immediately known. The shooting took place near the illegal settlement of Ofra, in the central West Bank. Israeli media reported that a passing car opened fire outside the settlement. On Wednesday night, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians in separate operations over the span of six hours. They were suspects in alleged attacks on Israelis.
