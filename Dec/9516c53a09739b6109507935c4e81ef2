Legacy Debt Fund, a mutual fund managed by First City Asset Management Limited (FCAM), has had its credit quality risk rating upgraded by one notch, from A(f)) to A+(f), by Agusto & Co, the foremost pan-African rating agency. The fund which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was also assigned a fund volatility rating of FV3. The higher ratings indicate low to moderate exposure to downside risk (impairment to the net asset value) in the medium term. FCAM is a subsidiary of FCMB Group Plc. The “A+(f)” credit quality rating reflects the fund’s minimal exposure to downside risk arising from credit defaults, while the “FV3” volatility rating indicates the fund’s moderate sensitivity to changing market conditions. According to Agusto & Co, “the upgrade in the credit quality rating of Legacy Debt Fund is based on the fund’s consistent practice of allocating more than 75% of the net assets in Federal Government securities.” Commenting on the upgrade, the Chief Executive Officer of FCAM, Mr. James Ilori, said, “Legacy Debt Fund has been upgraded by three notches, in the last one year. We thank the rating agency, Agusto & Co, for recognising our consistency, professionalism and hardwork, in the management of Legacy Debt Fund.
