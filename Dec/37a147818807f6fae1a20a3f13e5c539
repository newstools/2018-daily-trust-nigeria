A member of the House of Representatives, Johnson Agbonayinma (APC, Edo) has alleged that “some disgruntled lawmakers in the National Assembly” are currently collecting signatures to impeach Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. According to him, such lawmakers are banking on the recent House of Representatives report that allegedly indicted the Vice President of illegally approving the sum of N5.8 billion for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), in clear breach of extant laws. Agbonayinma, in a press statement to newsmen at the National Assembly Press Corps in Abuja, said he had concrete evidence of ongoing plans to impeach the Vice President, but stopped short of naming those behind the plot. “I want you to be aware that signatures are currently being collected by disgruntled lawmakers to impeach the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo. “The reason is because of the outcome of the NEMA investigations. “For the records, the issues raised in the NEMA probe had to do with the misappropriation of funds by the Director-General, financial spending, procurement processes, among others. “While I commend my colleagues in the discharge of their constitutional duties, I appeal to them to sheathe their swords, to continue to do the things that will promote the peace and unity of Nigeria,” Agbonayinma stated.
