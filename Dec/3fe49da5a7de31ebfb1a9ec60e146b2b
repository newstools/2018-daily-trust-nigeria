An Ebute MetaChief Magistrate Court in Lagos at the weekend ordered the remand of a 34-year-old man, Best Oji, for allegedly defiling a seven-year-old girl. The police said Oji had been engaging the victim in sex in the past 12 months at Kakaremo Street, Shasha, Lagos, where he was a neighbour to her parents. According to the police prosecutor, Mr Donny Raphael, the first time the incident happened was in 2017 in the apartment of the accused where he allegedly inserted his fingers in the girl’s private part. “The assault was exposed this year after the parents of the victim discovered changes in her body. They interrogated her and she revealed what Oji had done to her, prompting the girl’s parents to report the matter to the police at the Shasha Division,” the prosecutor said. The court did not take Oji’s plea as Mr Raphael informed the court that the victim was a minor and the case would require the advice of the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution. Thus, the magistrate, Mrs B.O Osunsanmi, ordered the defendant to be remanded in prison custody without an option of fine. The court then directed the prosecutor to send the file to the DPP for advice.
