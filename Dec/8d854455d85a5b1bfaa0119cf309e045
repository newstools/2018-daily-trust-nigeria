The federal government has warned the chief executives of all government-revenue generating agencies to sit-up or be sanctioned as “there will be consequences for failure to meet revenue targets.” The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab S. Ahmed disclosed this on Monday in Abuja at the quarterly ministerial press briefing. The minister noted that whilst revenue performance has improved, it is still not meeting set targets “thus warns revenue generating CEOs to up their game or face the boots.” “Whilst this year’s revenue performance presents an improvement from last year, with a recorded increase of 40 percent as at the end of the third Quarter of 2018, this performance is unsatisfactory to our administration when compared with the targets that we set out to achieve with an overall revenue outturn of 53 percent in the same period,” she noted. Thus, she said, the head of government agencies will be held responsible for revenue set targets. “That means, there will be consequences for failure to meet revenue targets” she assured. page 27 This budget hides something Taxation and challenges of economic development
