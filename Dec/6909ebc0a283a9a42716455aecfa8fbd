The PDP has claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari is not preparing for free, fair and credible elections in 2019 and therefore refused to put his campaign team to show any sign of seriousness. The PDP in a statement, yesterday, by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the Buhari-led Presidency and the APC were more committed to rigging the elections. The PDP said the fact that Buhari has failed to constitute his campaign council or develop a clear-cut campaign blueprint, 60 days to the election was an indication that he was not preparing for free and fair polls. “Mr. President and his party, the APC have failed to set up a campaign structure because they are banking on their plots with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), under Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to manipulate the electoral process and rig for them. “It is clear that President Buhari has been overwhelmed over his rejection by a vast majority of Nigerians, who are bearing the brunt of his incompetent and corrupt administration; that is why he cannot articulate any campaign message after the failed launch of his copied and widely spurned ‘Next Level’ mantra. “All over the world, patriotic and obligated leaders, who are seeking (re-) election, go to the electorate to canvass for votes with their messages and solutions. But our president and the APC have been busy procuring phony endorsements, harassing and intimidating opposition leaders, compromising the electoral body to create illegal voting centers, delaying election budgets and holding the process to ransom by refusing to sign amendments to the Electoral Act that eliminate avenues for rigging,” the PDP said. 2019 polls: PDP, APC draw battle line over Electoral Act INEC, Presidency plotting to rig through illegal polling centres in Chad, Niger - PDP Renewed smear campaign against Atiku won’t help you, PDP tells Buhari, APC
