The Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Muhammad Babandede has said the service is working on a strategy to stop foreigners from participating in next year’s general election. Babandede disclosed this while speaking to the press at the NIS’s end of year award night at the service headquarters in Abuja. He assured that the service will be fully involved in the election process to ensure that no foreigner is allowed to vote. “What I will do if I see them during election is that we will arrest them if we see them trying to participate by voting”, he said. “This year, we have retrieved over 700 voter cards from non-Nigerians. We will be there during elections to ensure that non-Nigerians don’t participate. “We will make sure that they don’t vote and they are not voted for. During the election, we will ensure the borders are secured so that nobody can enter the country during the days of election. “Immigration service has changed for the better. We have built the capacity of personnel and improved on structures and contributed to Nigeria’s security and prosperity in many ways.” Babandede said. 26 personnel of the NIS were given awards during the dinner. 2,000 PVCs seized from expatriates in Lagos Immigration to establish biometric centres in each LG We won't allow malpractices in Osun gubernatorial election- FG
