German leader Angela Merkel ruled out further negotiations on Brexit on Tuesday but said efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances after Prime Minister Theresa May abruptly pulled a parliamentary vote at home because she faced defeat. A day after pulling the vote in the face of ridicule from lawmakers, May rushed to The Hague for breakfast with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and then to Berlin to meet Chancellor Merkel before a trip to Brussels. The message from the EU was clear: it will give assurances about how it will interpret the exit treaty, but will not countenance reopening the text itself. According to two sources, Merkel told her own German conservative parliamentary group on Tuesday that there would be no further negotiations on Brexit but efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances. May had informed Merkel that the deal would have been voted down, and that it was in nobodyâ€™s interest for Britain to leave with no accord, the sources said.
