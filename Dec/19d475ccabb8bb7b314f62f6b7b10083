Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State has dismissed reports that he donated N3billion towards President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election in 2019. Obiano, who described the reports as untrue and fallacious, also refuted the allegation that he donated N500m in addition to nine brand new vehicles to the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Gen. John Gbor during the official launch of the party’s 2019 general election campaign. He wondered how he could be working for two presidential candidates in the same election. The governor, who spoke through his commissioner of Information & Public Enlightenment, C. Don Adinuba, in a statement said those peddling the rumours were amazed at the overwhelming endorsement he got from the people of Anambra State during the last governorship election. He said: “It was regrettable that despite the loud statement of Anambra voters at last year’s governorship election, those who were against the prevailing social harmony in the state have returned to their discredited trajectory.” Obiano meets Buhari, says no plan to join APC Anambra guber: Parties make tall promises to woo voters Why I dumped PDP to support Obiano guber race - Ubah
