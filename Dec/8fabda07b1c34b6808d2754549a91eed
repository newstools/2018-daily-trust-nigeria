Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo has insisted the tradermoni, a social intervention programme for traders and market women, by the federal government was not a leverage to lure voters for the ruling APC in the 2019 general elections. Professor Osinbajo stated this while fielding questions from journalists at the Asaba international airport, on his way back to Abuja after visiting Warri, Ughelli and Asaba to flag off the scheme. He said it was worrisome that some persons would think that tradermoni and market money empowerment programmes of the federal government were ploys to seek for votes. The vice president said the fund for the empowerment programmes was duly approved by the National Assembly which is strictly meant to assist market men and women to enhance their businesses without any ulterior motives. “The scheme was duly approved by the National Assembly, if they don’t like the empowerment programmes because they are on the other side, then it calls for concern”, he said.
