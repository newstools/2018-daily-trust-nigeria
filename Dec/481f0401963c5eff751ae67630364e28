Motorists travelling from Abuja to other parts of the country have been warned to steer clear of intoxicants and other hard drugs while driving to reduce road crashes during the festive period. The FCT sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Mr. Wobin Ayuba Gora, who spoke with our reporter in Abuja, yesterday, said regular and special corps marshals have been equipped with modern appliances to test drivers on the highways. He warned that any motorist caught driving under the influence of narcotic drugs or alcohol would be severely sanctioned. He said the yuletide season was a period for drivers to be cautious to avoid road accidents and one of the best ways to do that was not to drive under the influence of intoxicants and to drive defensively. He said the command had deployed personnel, including special marshals, on the highways to curtail activities of recalcitrant drivers on the roads. He added that FRSC personnel had been equipped with modern appliances that would test drivers for drunk driving and arrest those who engage in overloading and speeding. He said sufficient road marshals and patrol vehicles had been deployed on all the road corridors leading out of Abuja, while broken down vehicles and other obstructions on the highways would be cleared before the usual Christmas rush begins in earnest to check accident rate on the roads.
