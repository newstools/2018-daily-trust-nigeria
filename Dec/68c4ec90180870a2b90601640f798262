The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP’s Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) has urged all Nigerians to vote out the All Progressives Congress,APC-led government in 2019 in order to build a united, prosperous and peaceful Nigeria. The Director, Media and Publicity of the the PPCO, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan said in a statement on Monday that Nigerians should use the occasion of Christmas to pray against poverty and hunger in the land. “This year’s Christmas celebration is unique, in that it marks the last under an oppressive and insensitive administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and his dysfunctional All Progressives Congress (APC), which relish in inflicting hunger, suffering and pains on the people. “The PPCO laments the ugly situation in which Nigerians cannot celebrate a wholesome Christmas as they use to do prior to the emergence of the Buhari presidency in 2015. “PPCO however, charges Nigerians not to despair as the PDP Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, whom they have resolved to elect as their new President, has already perfected templates to revamp our economy and ease suffering in our nation. “The Atiku Abubakar policy document shows his commitment to entrench greater participation of our citizens in economic activities in various sectors, as against the Buhari exclusionist system, where our collective patrimony is only accessed by a cabal in the Presidency and corrupt APC leaders. “Nigerians should therefore, celebrate this year’s Christmas, focusing on the brighter future that awaits our nation under Atiku Abubakar as the next President and not on the pessimism and promise of more suffering by President Buhari. “In this regard, the PPCO urges Nigerians to use the occasion to show love and share with compatriots in anticipation of a brighter future,” the campaign organisation said.
