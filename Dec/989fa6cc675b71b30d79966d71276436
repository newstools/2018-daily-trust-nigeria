Suspected Boko Haram insurgents yesterday attacked Buni Gari town in Gujba local government area of Yobe state. The town located less than 4 kilometres to the 27 taskforce brigade, and about 53 kilometres to Damaturu, the state capital, is witnessing the second attack in 30 days. Daily Trust gathered that the attack started around 6pm on Saturday with sporadic gunshots and houses being set ablaze by the assailants. Residents that escaped to the nearby bushes told our correspondent that the attack was a reprisal to the killing of two militants by a hunters’ group in the town. Baana Musti, revealed that ten days ago, four insurgents went to the town to forcefully took away a woman they claimed to be their wife when the hunters’ group intercepted them. “The woman was married to a resident, so the hunter resisted; they killed two, caught and handed over one to military, while the other one escaped. The incident happened 20 days after the insurgents attacked and killed 8 soldiers at the military base,” he said. Another resident, who doesn’t want to be named said they got prior knowledge that the insurgents were planning to attack the town that was why many people fled before their arrival. “Over 2,000 women, children and men are taking refuge in the bush now,  in fact, we don’t know what to do.  We learnt that they are still burning our houses,” he said.
