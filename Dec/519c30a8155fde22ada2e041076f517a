Rescuers have found nine dead construction workers after a fire in a mine in Russia operated by potash maker Uralkali, Russian news agencies reported on Sunday. The workers were trapped underground by smoke after a fire broke out in the mine in Solikamsk, some 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Moscow, on Saturday morning. The fire, which broke out in a section of the mine that was under construction, has yet to be fully extinguished, Interfax reported.
