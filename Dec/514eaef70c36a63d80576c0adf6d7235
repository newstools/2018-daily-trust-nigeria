The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has said after winning the 2019 election, and form a unity government, his regime would not accommodate any cabal. Atiku spoke Friday in Abuja, during a meeting between him and leaders of 45 political parties who endorsed him as consensus candidate for 2019. He said forming a government of national unity was crucial at a critical time Nigeria was facing security, economic and other challenges. Atiku, a former vice president, said he was in the race this time to push out the All Progressives Congress (APC) government which he said, has failed on campaign promises. “If we had not driven the military away, we wouldn’t have been here talking about political parties or democracy. So you have a lot of work to do. You shouldn’t go back and rest because you have endorsed. I want to assure you that as long as we have a government of national unity, there won’t be a cabal,” he stressed. The Director General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council and Senate President, Bukola Saraki, asked leaders of political parties to prevail on President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the Electoral Amendment Bill into law. A former Minister of Foreign Affairs and key player in the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), Chief Tom Ikimi, however, alerted that there was a deliberate strategy by the ruling APC to penetrate and weaken the Coalition. The National Chairmen of the Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA) who doubles as Chairman of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Chief Peter Ameh,Labour Party (LP), Alhaji A.A Salam,Alliance for Democracy (AD), Chief Joseph Avazi, Green Party of Nigeria (GPN), Chief Sam Eke among others were in attendance.
