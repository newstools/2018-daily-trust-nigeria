Some stakeholders of the PDP in Bayelsa State have expressed fear over the party’s chances of winning elections in the state. They said winning the presidential and National Assembly elections would be a herculean task due to what they termed the “undemocratic manner of choosing the party candidates in the just concluded primaries.” During a round table discussion to assess the chances of PDP in the state held on Tuesday in Yenagoa, members of the Bayelsa PDP Stakeholders Forum blamed Governor Seriake Dickson for the predicaments of the party. In a communiqué at the end of the meeting which was signed by the convener, Chief Lambert Ebebimo, the stakeholders also described the situation where candidates were handpicked for the forthcoming election as one of the ways to weaken the party and pave way for the opposition APC to win the state during the presidential election. They, however, promised to work assiduously to ensure that PDP remained the ruling party in the state, saying Bayelsa had been the highest beneficiary of PDP in the whole of the South South region. They called on the national chairman of party, Chief Uche Secondus, to wade in and ensure that excesses of selfish people in the party were checked before the presidential election coming up in February.
