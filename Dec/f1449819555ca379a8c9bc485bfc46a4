Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said some elites in the country have ganged up against President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking during the National Consultative Forum of the National Committee of Buhari Support Groups, the Vice President said the elites want the President to die. He however said come February next year, Buhari would be declared winner of the presidential election. “Come February 2019, the APC will by the grace of God win the general elections. We will return President Muhammadu Buhari as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for a second term. The election will be a historic one. “It is a battle between those who want our country’s resources to be used for our country and her people, and those who want to privatize the commonwealth. “The man who stands against the forces of retrogression but with the future of our children is the man called Muhammadu Buhari. He is not a perfect man, but he is an honest and truthful man. “They prayed for him to die he didn’t die, when he came back hale and hearty by the grace of the Almighty God, they mourned while Nigerians rejoiced. The fear of Buhari makes people desperate even crazy. Now, they say he is Jubrin from Sudan. If you can’t discredit him, say he doesn’t exist! “They were all alive and well when Pastor Adeboye went to London and prayed for him the day before he returned to Nigeria. How will one Jubrin sit in FEC and conduct meetings, consult with his ministers, speak to me daily! “Their strategy is simple: if you tell a lie often enough, some will believe you….Buhari is not only alive and well, he will by God’s grace live long and well after his second term in office,” he said.
