Ahead of the 2019 elections, a member of the House of Representatives, Mohammad Gudaji Kazaure, representing Kazaure/Roni/Giwa/Yan Kwashi Federal Constituency of Jigawa State, has launched ‘Next Level for Buhari/Osinbajo 2019’ campaign platform for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari. Kazaure, who is also the National Coordinator of the group, said he would be using his nine million social media followers who had vowed to vote President Muhammad Buhari in the 2019 elections. The Publicity Secretary of the platform, Jamil Bala Muhaammad, said in a statement that Kazaure urged Nigerians to vote Buhari again to enable him continue with the good work he started. Speaking after members of the group visited him in Abuja, Kazaure said there was no alternative to President Buhari and that voting him means moving Nigeria forward, while voting PDP means going backwards to the days of corruption and impurity.
