The National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP) is managed by the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC). In the last 13 years, NDPHC has raised the installed power generation capacity to about 13,000 megawatts (MW). It has also done 112 transmission projects to raise bulk electricity wheeling capacity. However, distribution capacity remains at slightly above 5,000MW. Daily Trust in this analysis, evaluates these interventions in advancing power transmission especially as the year 2018 ends. We’re promoting FG’s 30,000MW target The Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing has an energy policy that is being implemented to deliver 30,000MW of electricity by year 2030, with 30 per cent of the energy delivered through renewable. As a driver of key interventions, officials of NDPHC in a chat with Daily Trust said the company has aligned with these policy objectives. On power generation, the officials said NDPHC through its NIPP has grown it by 60 per cent in 13 years while it contributes over 35 per cent of the current installed capacity. The transmission segment managed by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is the vital bridge between high voltage power generated from Generation Companies (GenCos) and passing same to the Distribution Companies (DisCos) for end-users nationwide. According to a project document obtained by Daily Trust, NDPHC has completed 112 high voltage (HV) transmission projects. The projects are in 31 Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) spanning over 2,355 kilometres across Nigeria. The breakdown shows that they cover 1,635km of 330kv Double Circuit (DC) lines, over 720km of 132kv DC lines. Among them are 10 new 330kv substations, and seven 132kv substations that connect to the DisCos’ injection substations. NDPHC has also procured and installed about 6,150MVA of 330/132kV transformer capacity, 2,800MVA of 132/33kV transformer capacity while it successfully expanded 36 units of 330kV and 132kV substations belonging to TCN, the records show. Executes special projects at Ajah, 7 others The scorecard of projects obtained from NDPHC also showed it did other special intervention projects across eight sites. They include the upgrade of Ajah/Lekki/Alagbon from 132kV to 330kV DC line, strengthening of same line which has been energised, and the strengthening of Asaba 330kV line along Benin/Onitsha transmission line. In Abuja, it is installing 75MVAR Shunt Reactor at Gwagwalada 330/132/33kV substation in Abuja. NDPHC has completed a 2x60MVA for the TCN 132/33kV substation. The Kukwaba substation project is ongoing at 85 per cent level while it is delivering 1X150MVA, 330/132kV and 2X60MVA transformers 132/33kv for the new Lafia substation. Completion of the 132kv DC Abakaliki – Ikom – Obudu transmission line is another key achievement so far. NDPHC spokesman Yakubu Lawal confirmed completion of other key projects for the transmission of power in the sector. The entire transmission projects under NIPP have significantly impacted on the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). The NDPHC records show that the 330kv lines have grown by 46 per cent since 2006 when NIPP intervened, reaching 6,932km from 4,738km; the 330/132kV transformer capacity rose by 93 per cent from 6,008MVA in 2006 to 11,590MVA presently. The 132kv lines now stand at 7,036km from 6,227km (13% rise); 132/33kV transformer capacity rose to 11,118MVA from 7,805MVA in 2006 (42% rise). NDPHC has not left the distribution section untouched in its intervention process. Since 2006, through NIPP, the company has raise DisCos’ capacity from 45,252km of 33kv transmission lines to 47,538km. The 11kV transmission lines rose by 15% from 31,973km to 36,648km; 33/11kV substations rose by 43% from 8,148MVA to 11,649MVA; 33kV & 11/0.415kV substations rose by 26% from 11,810MVA to 14,878MVA; 33kV & 11/0.415kV substations increased from 32,000MVA to 84,170MVA (163% increase),and the 33kV/11kV substations rose by 25%, from 1,048MVA to 1,311MVA. NDPHC said it recently commissioned key transmission substations and lines to raise bulk electricity wheeling capacity. They include the 330kv Ikot Ekpene Switching Station, 330kv DC Alaoji – Ikot Ekpene line, 330kv DC Calabar – Ikot Ekpene line, multi-complex  Gwagwalada substation, and the 330kv DC Gwagwalada – East Main line. Transmission projects for 2019 Looking into 2019, the company has pegged critical transmission projects for completion. “Ensuring soonest completion of these projects is of utmost importance to the present administration’s goal of providing Nigerians with adequate electricity,” NDPHC said in the projection document. The Otta 132/33kV TCN substation expansion project in Ogun State was upgraded and energised in May 2018 after the installation of a 60MVA transformer with three 33kv feeders among others. However NDPHC will complete other projects at Papalanto and Old Abeokuta for full commissioning of the interconnected projects. In the East, the power intervention company is working at the Ihiala 1X150MVA 330/132 Substation and a Turn-in Turn-out of Alaoji 330kv Single Circuit at Ihiala.  “This important project has been delayed by inability of the contractor to fund its operations as expected,” it noted. NDPHC said it only knew recently when the contractors admitted paucity of funds and requested for 2,471 million euro and another N126m, about 10 per cent of the contract costs. To avoid breaching procurement laws, officials said NDPHC is now making new arrangements on modalities to provide funding within the contract towards easing the contractor’s cash flow challenges without breaching regulations. “NDPHC is now reworking a new completion date with the EPC in the light of the foregoing which we hope will not exceed April 31st 2019,” the official said. In the South South, the Ikot Ekpene – Afam 330kv DC line construction is on the radar. NDPHC had decried several vandalisms by militants resulting in the collapse of five towers. It however said: “Security is reinforced along the line with military and local vigilante. Dismantling of affected towers and conductors and rehabilitation is now ongoing.” It has also set April 30, 2019 as the completion date for this transmission project. For the Ikot Abasi – Ikot Ekpene 330kV DC line construction, it said works and procurement were ongoing to fix the 195 tower locations. “The forecast completion date is April 2019,” it noted. Expectations With these huge transmission projects for completion before the first half of 2019, there could be a possible rise in bulk electricity wheeling capacity. The TCN Managing Director, Usman Gur Mohammed, at a recent briefing pegged the capacity in November 2018 at 8,100MW while anticipating 20,000MW by year 2021. NDPHC said it is hopeful that with the completion of the critical transmission projects, generated power in Nigeria will be better transmitted to the DisCos to meet the huge energy demands of Nigerians. “The NDPHC is certainly living up to its responsibilities,” it noted.
