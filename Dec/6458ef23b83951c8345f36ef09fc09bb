A popular independent radio presenter and broadcaster, Sunday Ogunsola, has lifted about 2,000 widows with foodstuffs, cash gifts and payment of medical bills. Ogunsola said the gesture was to cushion, the effects of hardship and poverty ravaging the country. The presenter, widely known as Tantala on radio in the Southwest, had floated a Foundation to take care of less priveleged women and widows by facilitating assistance and contributions from well-meaning Nigerians. At a three-in-one celebration held in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, at the weekend, Ogunsola said he was using the occasion to also reward those who had been supporting the Foundation since two years ago when it started to distribute foodstuffs to widows. He said, “We announced through our radio and television programmes for good spirited individuals to help underprivileged widows in the society, and, today, we are celebrating and rewarding those who had responded positively to our clarion calls. “We also engage in collaboration and partnership with organisations, and we are still reaching out to government and individuals to assist us so that we can reach out to a larger number of widows and underprivileged in the society.” Responding, one of the widows, Mrs Oluyemi Olopade, who said her husband died in 2007, leaving her with six children to cater for, thanked the broadcaster for the gesture.  2, 000 widows to benefit from Rural Health Insurance Scheme in Enugu State When NGO brightened yuletide for widows Widows  request government protection
