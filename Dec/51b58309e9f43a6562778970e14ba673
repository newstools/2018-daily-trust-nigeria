The Borno State All Progressives Congress (APC) has issued a stern warning to those it describes as “Abuja Politicians” planning to hold a presidential campaign rally for President Muhammadu Buhari in the state soon without its approval, to steer clear of the state. “I heard some mischievous Abuja politicians, calling themselves Borno indigenes, are planning to come to Borno to launch the presidential campaign for Buhari without our knowledge and approval,” the state APC Chairman, Ali Bukar Dalori, told newsmen on Thursday in Maiduguri. “We don’t know them; they are not our card-carrying members; they cannot therefore, do anything in the name of APC; we are the APC, and we do not approve of what they are coming to do,” the vice Chairman of the Forum of APC chairmen warned. He issued the stern warning: “They should steer clear of Borno; but if they insist on doing what they plan, then we have prepared to deal with them in whatever way.” Dalori, who would not mention names, insinuated: “They went to PDP and destroyed it; and now they say they are in APC; but they should know that they can’t destroy APC; we will not take this; the National Secretariat of our party should know that we in Borno are not rubber stamps.” Security not main reason of choosing indirect primaries in Borno - APC chair Borno 2019: Sheriff wants to manipulate Buhari, Oshiomhole – Ex-Deputy Governor Borno by-election: APC’s opponents exist only on Facebook –  Dalori
