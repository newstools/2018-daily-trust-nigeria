The implementation of the regulatory framework for environmental protection in the Nigerian oil and gas sector is still very weak, a research has shown. This is despite the existence of a rich set of regulations in the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum Industry in Nigeria (EGASPIN), it also showed. The research, conducted by a team including the Institute for Oil, Gas, Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development (OGEES Institute) Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, said there was need to clarify and streamline the functions of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR). The EGASPIN is a set of regulations initiated by DPR to govern health safety and environment (HSE) activities in the oil and gas industry. Speaking at a stakeholders workshop to validate the findings of the research team in Abuja, the Executive Director of the OGEES Institute, Prof. Damilola Olawuyi, said the team did a comparative assessment of the environmental framework in the oil and gas sector to ascertain if EGASPIN complied with international best practices. He said the assessment found that EGASPIN was rich but implementation was the weakest link. “There is confusion on the roles of agencies with multiple and overlapping responsibilities. We think this does not provide the right atmosphere for a strong implementation of environmental guidelines in the oil sector,” he said.
