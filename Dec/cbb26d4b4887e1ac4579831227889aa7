The leader of Presidential Support Committee (PSC), Ambassador Lawan Muhammad Munir, says the re-election bid of President Muhammadu Buhari will be easy to realise with the achievements so far recorded by his administration. Munir, who spoke with journalists in Abuja after a meeting to collapse all support groups, lauded the Buhari-led APC Federal Government for constructing roads, repairing spoilt ones, renovating hospitals, and providing medicines. He also hailed the administration for kick-starting the construction of the Second Niger Bridge, constructing new runways at airports, and increasing power generation. Munir said, “We meet in respect of the effort being made to ensure that President Buhari returns to power in 2019. His achievements are just too many to mention. But anybody who is going up and down in the country will see the roads being constructed and those being repaired,” he said. “We are going from zonal, state, local government to ward level for the campaigns; we are going from house-to-house and we have already started. So, it will be very easy to get Mr President re-elected,” he said. He dismissed the notion that northern leaders were divided over the endorsement of President Buhari.
