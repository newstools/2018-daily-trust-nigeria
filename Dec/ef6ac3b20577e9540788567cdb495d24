An FCT High Court in Maitama has ordered the police to regularise their proof of evidence as it relates to the list of witnesses and summary of evidence in the murder charge against Maryam Sanda. Justice Yusuf Halilu, who made the order following an objection to the evidence of the police’s 6th witness in the trial, adjourned the matter to January 22 for definite continuation of hearing. Maryam Sanda is being tried for allegedly killing her husband, Bilyaminu Bello, a nephew of former PDP Chairman, Alhaji Bello Halliru Muhammad. She was docked alongside her brother, Aliyu Sanda; her mother, Maimuna Aliyu and one Sadiya, who were accused of assisting her to conceal the evidence by cleaning the blood of the deceased from the scene of the crime. They pleaded not guilty. At the resumed hearing on Monday, counsels to the defendants, Olusegun Jolaawo and Hussaini Musa had jointly objected to the testimony of the 6th prosecution witness, Josephine Onyengo, a policewoman. Jolaawo said the objection was based on the premise that the witness’ name was not mentioned in the proof of evidence and as such the defence does not have access to the summary of the evidence she would be giving in court as provided for the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act (ACJA). Responding, the prosecution counsel, Fidelis Ogbobe asked for an adjournment to be able to summon the police officer mentioned in the proof of evidence, who he said had been transferred to Edo State Command. Justice Halilu held that there should be full compliance with the provisions of ACJA and that the prosecutor must not assume that because the witness is a police officer he/she can just be brought to testify without first informing the defendants through the appropriate means. He adjourned the matter to January 22, 2019.
