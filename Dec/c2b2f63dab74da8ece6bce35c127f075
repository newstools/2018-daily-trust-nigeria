The Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM), yesterday, expressed displeasure over widespread installation of ad-on skid Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) plants in fuel stations, urging the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to discontinue the approval of selling or locating such plants in fuel stations. According to Mr Nosakhare Ogieva-Okunbor, President of NALPGAM, installing ad-on skid gas plants in fuel stations was dangerous He said both LPG, known as cooking gas, and fuel were highly inflammable which needed to be on separate entities, adding that LPG cylinders were potentially and highly hazardous. Ogieva-Okunbor,  who was speaking in Lagos on Tuesday,  expressed worry over the increasing number of filling stations engaged in selling of gas within the stations not minding the hazardous implications. He said such proliferation had raised further safety concerns, considering the less than satisfactory compliance with minimum environmental safety requirements for the operations of those facilities.
