The Social Democratic Party (SDP) gubernatorial candidate in Ogun state, Rotimi Paseda, has vowed to tackle huge debt profile in the state with financial re-engineering if elected in 2019. Paseda, who spoke at the Ogun West SDP end of the year’s celebration party held at Grand Owoeye  Hotel in Atan, Ado-Odo/Ota  Local Government, expressed displeasure over what he termed  “gross mismanagement of fund” by Governor Ibikunle Amosun-led government. The governorship hopeful argued that there is no state without debt, but frowned at mismanagement of fund, which according to him, may plunge a state into huge debt profile. The SDP governorship candidate promised to restore the dignity of the state and “give the residents the much-desired dividends of democracy.” The former UPN governorship candidate also promised to restore standard education in the state through a free and qualitative education scheme “as opposed to the current system.” Paseda also disclosed that his administration would provide a minimum of 1,000 Megawatts of power within four years, with a view to improving the state economy and enhance productivity of the artisans in the state. “The economy is driven by Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs). First, we will look at education and then look at ways to support entrepreneurs. Also, the ease of doing business will be addressed. “This 2019 election is the mother of all elections. It is not going to be about money; it is not going to be about parties; it is going to be about individuals and it’s going to be about candidate,” he said.
