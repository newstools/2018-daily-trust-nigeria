The ruling APC has described the decision of Atiku Abubakar to sign the peace deal as a face-saving move following widespread condemnation that greeted his initial alleged refusal to agree to the peace deal. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement issued yesterday, said it was obvious that Atiku tried to avoid signing the national peace accord ahead of the country’s 2019 general elections. Issa-Onilu said the PDP and Atiku’s “dubious claim of a communication lapse” as reason for their no-show at Tuesday’s formal signing ceremony was hogwash to all discerning Nigerians. He said the peace committee duly and formally invited the PDP and Atiku like other candidates and political parties contesting the 2019 elections. “We, however, must not lose sight of the dangerous and ominous signs the PDP and Atiku have inadvertently shown Nigerians in the lead up to the elections,” he said.
