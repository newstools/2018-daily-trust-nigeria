The Benue State Commissioner of Police, Ene Okon, has said his command would not tolerate political hostility from any of the political parties in the state ahead of the 2019 election. Speaking at a press briefing in Makurdi, Okon said the warning became expedient against the background of last week’s destruction of bill boards and other campaign materials by political opponents in Taraka local government area of the state. “We will deal decisively with politicians, individuals or group who destroy opponents’ bill boards or other campaign materials no matter their standing in the society. Politicians must conduct themselves orderly,” he said. The commissioner also noted that there were massive proliferation of arms by politicians, stressing however that the command had arrested two local arms manufacturers from the Yelwata axis of the state. He said the arrest of the duo; Donatus Ahongh, 56, and Boyi Ayaayua, 26, both of Yelwata town in Guma local government area, was made by a team of FSARS based on credible intelligence. Okon listed items recovered from the suspects to include; 12 assorted locally fabricated arms with their manufacturing implements as well as one AK47.
