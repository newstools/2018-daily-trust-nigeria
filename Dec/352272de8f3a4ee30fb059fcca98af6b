A commercial driver in a vehicle with registration number, BDG 202 DL, yesterday slumped and died while in traffic along the Akwanga-Lafia road in Nasarawa State. The incident occurred at Gako hill about 10km to Nassarawa-Eggon town while in traffic caused by long vehicles blocking the road around Angwa Chiyawa. Documents in the driver’s vehicle revealed his name as Mr Segun Adebayo, a member of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Nyanya Branch. The deceased was carrying passengers going to Akwanga and Lafia and had gone past the first town when he died. One of the passengers, Mr Ayuba Allu, said the driver did not show any sign of illness before the sudden incident. Mr Allu, who alongside six women and two other men boarded the vehicle from Nyanya, said as they approached the traffic at Goko hill, the driver could no longer control the vehicle and that one of them had to step in to bring the vehicle to a halt. He added that while they were trying to figure out what was happening, they realized that the driver was no longer breathing. When Daily Trust on Sunday got to the scene of the incident, the passengers, particularly the women were crying while the men appeared to be in shock. A call was put through to the emergency line of the Federal Road Safety Corps, who promised to immediately dispatch a team to the scene and about two hours later, they arrived and evacuated the corpse to a mortuary. A similar call was also put to the Nigeria Police emergency line in Nasarawa State who also promised to dispatch personnel to the scene.
