Internally Displaced Persons from the June’s attack on Barkin Ladi local government area of Plateau State yesterday returned to their communities six months after they were displaced. About 204 households from Kakuruk, Kuzen and Kura Falls in Barkin Ladi returned home under what Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) classified as phase one of the repatriation programme for 18 communities affected by insecurity. Sighting their communities, the women began to sing and many could not hold back tears. They were converged on the Kakuruk Central Primary school under heavily armed security personnel where they were briefed on the next line of action before taken to their respective villages. Sarah Pam from Kuzen said: “it was tears of what happened, tears of the people we lost and tears of seeing our homes once again. We have lost so much, i never knew i would see home again and now i don’t know where to start from but we are prayerful and believe everything will be fine.” Governor Simon Bako Lalong while briefing the returnees said his government had ensured adequate security before their return, adding that, “no one will harass you and your security is guaranteed. Building materials will also be provided to communities that have been destroyed to ensure that they rebuild before they are also repatriated in January.” Lalong, who was represented by the Acting Secretary to the State Government, Richard Tokma, said  building materials would be made available to those who lost their homes and crops and farm implements provided to make them comfortable and return to their occupations. Earlier, Operation Safe Haven Commander, Major-General Augustine Agundu, hadsaid the first phase of the repatriation consists of those who abandoned their villages for fear but their homes had been found to be in good conditions.   37 killed in fresh Jos violence –STF Plateau: Fulani tell sordid tales in camps Tears, agony greet incessant killings at Barkin-Ladi
