The member representing Munsawa/Matazu Federal Constituency of Katsina State in the House of Representatives, Ibrahim Murtala, has dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Murtala’s notice of defection was contained in a letter read by Speaker Yakubu Dogara at the floor of the House at the beginning of Tuesday’s plenary. In the letter, Murtala acknowledged that he was now happy to leave the “crisis ridden” APC for the PDP family. The announcement of Murtala’s defection was followed by rapturous applause by PDP members of the House, who clapped and chanted the party’s slogan for over two minutes.
