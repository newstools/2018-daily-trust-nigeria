Wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, urged women in Nigeria to vote for her husband in the forthcoming presidential election. She made the appeal at a National Women Leadership Summit organized by a political group, Project 4+4 for Buhari & Osinbajo 2019, at the National Women Development Center, Abuja. Mrs. Buhari observed that during the last election, women participated fully in the voting process and ensured that APC was elected. She said it was because of the support Buhari got from women in 2015 that he came up with social investment programmes targeted at them and their children. Quoted in a statement by her spokesperson, Suleiman Haruna,  She called on women in the country to spread the good news of the accomplishments of this administration. Wife of the Vice President, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, while speaking at the event commended women for providing a permanent support base for the APC, saying they remained ambassadors of the party wherever they found themselves.
