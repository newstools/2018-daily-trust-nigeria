Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, yesterday, said his administration has been able to justify the confidence reposed in it by the electorate in the state to warrant a second term in office. Speaking during a stakeholders meeting on his re-election bid in Minna, Governor Bello said he had been able to positively impact on the lives of Nigerlites through the restoration agenda aimed at repositioning the state towards the path of growth and development. Bello said he met a state which was virtually on its knees with all the sectors in comatose, adding that his administration was able to turn the fortunes of the state around through a well-articulated programme of development. He promised that if re-elected, he would consolidate on the gains so far recorded in all fronts. Bello said there was no alternative to the APC, adding that the party both at federal and state levels was able to achieve what the PDP failed to accomplish in 16 years.
