The Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has called on the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, not to support any candidate in the 2019 elections to avoid being sidelined if its choice candidate loses out. Gov. Okorocha said Ohanaeze should be smart when it came to the issue of partisan politics so that no matter the candidate or the party that won, it could still be relevant in the scheme of things. Speaking when members of the National Organising Committee for the 2018 Igbo Day Celebration visited him in his office in Owerri, Okorocha also tasked the leaders to set aside a day for soul searching and atonement for Ndigbo so as to chart a new course of unity and reconciliation among the Igbo ahead of next yearâ€™s elections, stating that the Igbo needed God more than anything else. Earlier, Chairman of the National Organising Committee for Igbo Day Celebration, Prof. Gregory Ibe, said the umbrella body of the Igbo across the globe annually organised the Igbo Day as a way of sustaining, projecting and celebrating the unique Igbo traditional heritage.
