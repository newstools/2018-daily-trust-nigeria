The minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that the way and manner the opposition party members of the National Assembly behaved on Wednesday when the president presented budget has provided the platform, the APC, to assert its majority in the National Assembly. The minister, who stated this on Thursday during a press conference with journalists in Abuja, said the plan by the opposition was to embarrass the President and prevent him from presenting the budget “but they were comprehensively overwhelmed by our lawmakers who are in the majority”. “That also sends a clear signal to the opposition that they lack the number to override the President’s decision not to accent to the Electoral Bill. I must also note that all through the sniping by some unruly lawmakers, the President remained dignified and presidential. He rose above it all to make his presentation,” he added. He also said the killing of the former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshall Alex Badeh (rtd) is “most dastardly and very unfortunate” adding that in line with the directive of the President to the security agencies to find the killers,  he has no doubt that they will be found and the perpetrators will be brought to justice.
