The Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) has suspended its earlier directive to commence shutdown of depots across the country from loading petroleum products effective from yesterday. The suspension of the shutdown by DAPPMAN was contained in a statement released in Lagos, yesterday, signed by its Executive Secretary, Olufemi Adewole. The association had earlier issued a shutdown directive to its members following the continuing indebtedness of the Federal Government to petroleum marketers. NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu, also in a statement said the corporation has ordered all its depots across the country and those of bulk purchase marketers it recently entered agreements with to undertake 24-hour operations to avert any shortages in products distribution in the country. Ughamadu in the statement said government was committed to going ahead with settling the N236bn first tranche of the verified subsidy claims of the oil marketers in line with the approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and National Assembly by Friday, 14 December, 2018 as noted by the corporationâ€™s Chief Operating Officer, Downstream, Engr. Henry Nkem Obih, in a statement recently.
