A defeated aspirant at the September 30, Borno State APC governorship primary election, Alhaji Idris Mamman Durkwa, has sued the party, its governorship candidate, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum, and INEC in the Maiduguri Federal High Court. Alhaji Durkwa asked the court to change Prof. Zulum and instead declare him (Durkwa) as the winner of the primary.  The case, with suit number FHC/MG/CS/55/2018, came up for mention yesterday at the court which was presided over by Justice Jude K. Dagat. The substantive application/originating summon was filed on October 19, 2018, by the plaintiff. In the prayers contained in the originating summon, the counsel to the plaintiff had argued, among others, that the primary was held without the participation of “lawful delegates who were chased out of the venue” and was, therefore, “illegal, unlawful, null and void.” He also declared that the election of the second respondent, Prof. Zulum, as the Borno State governorship candidate by the first respondent, APC, was “illegal, unlawful, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.” The counsel prayed the court to issue an order of perpetual injunction prohibiting and or restraining the APC from recognising Prof. Zulum as its Borno State governorship candidate. The case was adjourned to January 17, 2019, to enable all parties in the case file and serve their processes.
