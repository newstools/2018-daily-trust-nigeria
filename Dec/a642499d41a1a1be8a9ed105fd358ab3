The Department of Petroleum Resources in Akwa Ibom State has sealed 46 fuel stations for under dispensing of petroleum products and for operating without licenses. Head of DPR Operations in Eket, Mr. Olusegun Dabor said yesterday in Uyo that some of the fuel stations had been operating illegally for more than six years without approved licenses from the agency. He lamented during a routine inspection of fuel stations in the state that the defaulting stations which were sealed this month were yet to acquire their license since they commenced operations while others had no sign posts. He said the department was on aggressive surveillance to check the activities of petroleum products sellers during the yuletide season, adding that the agency was working with sister agencies to monitor the sealed fuel stations in the state. He mentioned that the names of the defaulters will be given to other sister agencies for further prosecution, noting that the defaulters have up to a month to repair their pumps before recommencing operations in the state. He advised the public against panic buying of petroleum products during this yuletide season, adding that the products are available in the country.
