The Jigawa State Government has spent over N4 billion on the cash grant scheme for people living with disabilities in the last 11 years. The Executive Secretary of Jigawa State Rehabilatation Board, Ibrahim Rabakaya, disclosed this to Daily Trust yesterday. He said over 4,000 people living with disabilities were benefitting from the monthly cash grant of N7,000, “but over the years, the number of the beneficiaries deflated to only about 2,000.” According to him, many of the eligible beneficiaries had died and that no replacement was effected hence, the decrease in their population. Rabakaya said the disbursement had been reduced from N30 million monthly to N14 million. He said with the improvement in the proposed next year’s budget of the board, a plan was underway to restore the distribution of skin cream and eye glasses to albinos living in the state. He said in 2016, the board spent N1.5 million on the purchase of sun cream for albinos, but due to paucity of fund, the gestured stopped. “Jigawa state government, has in the last 11 years spent over N4 billion on cash grant for People Living With Disability. In the past, of over 4,000 eligible PLWDs in the state, each got N7,000 monthly cash grant. But due to the problem of lack replacement of those that died, government spending under the scheme dropped from N30 million monthly to N14 million.” Group targets 5000 jobs per LG Albinos lament plight Jigawa saves N500m from hajj costs
