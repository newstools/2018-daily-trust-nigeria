The PDP has  alleged that  the budget presented to the National Assembly  by President Muhammadu Buhari was full of false performance indices, claims of non-existent projects and fake promises. Addressing a press conference last night in Abuja, the PDP National Publicity Secretary who doubles as the Director Media and Publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said Buhari and the APC were awaiting “crushing defeat in 2019.” The party also said it was wrong for anyone to say that the PDP instigated the booing of the president during the budget presentation. “As usual, Mr. President dwelt on fictitious figures, unrealistic projections and could not give a credible account of the performance of the 2018 budget, which like other annual budgets, since he came into office remained unimplemented due to sheer incompetence and humongous corruption in his presidency. No wonder he was booed by the lawmakers,” he said.
