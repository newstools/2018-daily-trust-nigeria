Russian and US officials have been involved in a spat over the landing in Venezuela of two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The two Tu-160 bombers landed in Venezuela on Monday in a Russian show of support for the government of socialist President Nicolás Maduro. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it amounted to “two corrupt governments squandering public funds”. The Russian government called his words “completely inappropriate”. President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Pompeo’s comments were “very undiplomatic”.
