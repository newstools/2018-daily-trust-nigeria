Nigeria will get its first ever gold refinery soon. This is coming as the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Abubakar Bawa Bwari did the ground breaking ceremony of the refinery at Mowe, Ogun state yesterday. In his speech at the ceremony, the minister said the Ministry developed a roadmap for the growth and development of the sector and identified seven strategic minerals for priority attention, with gold as the commodity that will get utmost priority. “During the Focus Labs of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan of this administration, we discovered that a well organised gold value chain can trigger an economic revolution like it did in India, South Africa, Switzerland and other countries.” Bwari said that it was based on this premise, that the Ministry approved the first Gold Refinery Licence to Messrs Kian Smith Nigeria Limited earlier this year. “We are here to officially mark the commencement of construction activities for the gold refinery plant believing that soon we shall gather again to witness the official commissioning of the refinery plant,” he added. He said gold supply will be sourced from registered artisanal miners to allow for effective monitoring and regulation of artisanal gold production and ensure that correct gold production data are available.
