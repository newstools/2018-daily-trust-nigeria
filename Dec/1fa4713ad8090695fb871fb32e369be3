The “overwhelming majority” of women and older girls who passed through Libya as migrants reported being gang-raped by traffickers or witnessed others taken away to be abused, according to a UN report based on hundreds of interviews. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a statement published yesterday that its report, along with the United Nations support mission in Libya, turned up “unimaginable horrors” among migrants who sought to reach Europe through the largely lawless country. The 61-page report covers the period between January 2017 and August 2018. The OHCHR said investigators pulled together 1,300 first-hand accounts detailing “a terrible litany of violations and abuses committed by a range of state officials, armed groups, smugglers and traffickers against migrants and refugees”. Those included unlawful killings, torture, arbitrary detention, gang rape, slavery, forced labour and extortion.
