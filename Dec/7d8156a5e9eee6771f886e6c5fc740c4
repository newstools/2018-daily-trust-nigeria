The presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has revealed that he lost a lot of money sponsoring women to be deputy governors in Northern states. Atiku, a former vice president who advised political parties to allot at least 30 per cent of deputy governorship slots to women during an interactive session with a coalition of PDP women yesterday in Abuja, said he had been trying to produce a  female deputy governor in any of the Northern states without success. “I have sponsored women as deputy governors. I lost all my money… Up to today I have not succeeded,” he said. “Every time I say let’s have a deputy governor in Kogi State, it wouldn’t work. Let’s have a deputy governor in Taraba State, it wouldn’t work. “The only way is to get the parties to make it mandatory to say a certain percentage of deputy governors should be women; otherwise, if we allow it to evolve on its own, it will take maybe another hundred years,” he said.
