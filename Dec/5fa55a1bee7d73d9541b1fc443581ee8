The curriculum being designed by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) for the certification and accreditation of Business Development Service Providers (BDSPs) will address challenges facing the country’s MSME sub-sector. The Minister of State, Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Hajiya Aisha Abubakar, made the remark at the validation workshop on the proposed curriculum for the certification and accreditation of the BDSPs held in Abuja recently. She lauded SMEDAN and its collaborators for the efforts they have made in drafting the curriculum. In a statement by SMEDAN, she said certification of BDSPs was in tandem with the desire of government towards ensuring global best practices in the development of the MSMEs sector as well as sustainable growth in the country. Represented by the Deputy Director, Industrial Development Department of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Opaluwa John, she noted that 95 percent of enterprises in the world are micro, small and medium and that they account for about 60 percent of private sector employment. In his address, the Director General of SMEDAN, Dr. Dikko Umaru Radda, said the need to have minimum standard for business development service providers in the country cannot be overemphasised. Represented by Mr. Monday Ewans, Director, Enterprise Development and Promotion Department of SMEDAN, the D-G said “we need to have a standard document, a standard procedure and a standard way of making sure that our BDSPs can be certified and recognised globally.” He also commended MAFITA and other stakeholders who worked hard to make the framework ready.
