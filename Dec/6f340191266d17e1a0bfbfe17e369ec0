The Kaduna State chapter of the APC has appointed 3,198 persons to drive its campaign to capture Kaduna Central senatorial zone in the forthcoming general elections. The council, with 25 directorates, is expected to work for the emergence of the special adviser to Governor Nasir el-Rufai on politics, Malam Uba Sani, as senator for Kaduna Central Senatorial zone. Elections in the zone would be among the keenly contested in the 2019 elections in Kaduna as parties such as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) have strong candidates like Lawan Adamu and Senator Shehu Sani. The Uba Sani Campaign Council boasts of some of the traditional hierarchies of political power in the state. The list, made available to newsmen in Kaduna at the weekend, had top guns like Second Republic lawmaker Alhaji Kabir Umar and the likes of Senator Sani Sale, Hon. Samaila Yakawada and Hon. Muazu Gangara.  Sen. Shehu Sani refuses to participate in APC Kaduna Central senatorial primaries APC right  on my candidacy â€” Uba Sani Kaduna Central APC endorses Uba Sani for Senate
