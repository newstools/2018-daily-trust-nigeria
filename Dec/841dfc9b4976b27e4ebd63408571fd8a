The Governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, has likened the 2019 general elections to contests between honest and dishonest people. Gov. El-Rufai, who delivered the keynote address at the launching of his campaign council in Kaduna, also likened Monday’s flag-off of the PDP presidential campaign in Sokoto to a “gang-up of “thieves.” The governor said the PDP rented crowd from neighbouring countries because Sokoto people refused to come out for the rally. He said Kaduna was not a state that would allow the PDP cheat the people and the masses. “What we have done in Kaduna State in the last three years has shown that APC as a party is the one that loves the masses and assists them, not a party that will take public funds and share among the rich. That is why we want you people to go out and tell the people to vote President Muhammadu Buhari again. “So, when it is time to launch President Muhammadu Buhari’s campaign in Kaduna, people should come for the whole world to see that it is not Niger Republic people that are disguising as Nigerians,” he said. “The PDP has nothing to offer the people of Kaduna State and they have nothing to offer the rest of Nigeria. Over 16 years, they left most of our 4,250 primary schools in terribly bad conditions; many did not have toilets, roofs, windows or doors. They left schools where more than half of the pupils had no desks or chairs. In some schools, the number of children sitting on the floor was more than 90 per cent.” The campaign council was inaugurated by the party’s Deputy National Chairman (North), Alhaji Lawal Shuaibu. 2019 election is between thieves and honest people – El-Rufai Only Atiku can challenge Buhari — Bako Men who want to unseat el-Rufai
