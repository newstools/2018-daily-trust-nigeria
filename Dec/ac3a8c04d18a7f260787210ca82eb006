As customers across the world seek more efficient and productive smart technology, household appliances pacesetter, LG, has been able to place itself as a leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) incorporated electronics and continues to provide the best-in-market ThinQ range that exceeds consumer expectations. To Mr Jiung Park, General Manager, Home Appliances Division at LG Electronics, West Africa, as a futuristic brand, LG’s innovative product line-up is using AI to directly connect with its consumers and make their lives more convenient. “The truth is, we won’t see AI’s true potential for years, if not decades. But 2019 is the year that AI will take a big step into the mainstream. AI is finding its way into TVs, washing machines and refrigerators, as well as audio solutions such as speakers under LG’s ThinQ platform. A product that is with you most of the day learning your behaviour has much greater potential than something used only occasionally,” Park said. He cited the power of OLED technology demonstrated at this year’s Customer Electronic Show (CES 2018) by LG as an example of the smart technology the company has been able to create. “The potential of this unique technology is vast. Its application in marketing techniques cannot be ignored by potential locations, including convention centres, shopping malls, city centres and shop fronts. Its novel appearance will certainly turn heads, with the ability to curve around any environment. This technology creates the perfect platform for different kinds of product signages and makes it stand out from the crowd,” he said. In the upcoming year, we may witness products with flexible viewing surfaces such as TVs, phones or tablets. With all of the excitement and enthusiasm surrounding the coming year, LG is already gearing up for the 5G tech era and how it will incorporate 5G into LG products and technology, as well as the daily lives of consumers.
