Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has demanded that Saudi Arabia extradite the suspects in writer Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. Speaking after the G20 in Argentina, he said Khashoggi had not featured in the talks and only Canada’s Justin Trudeau had brought the subject up. Saudi Arabia has charged 11 people with the murder, but there is no suggestion it will send them to Turkey. It denies that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the killing. The Saudi journalist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. President Donald Trump has also denied US media reports that the CIA believes such an operation would have needed the approval of Prince Mohammed, known as MBS.
