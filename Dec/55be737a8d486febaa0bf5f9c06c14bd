Sudanese MPs have backed a move to amend the constitution to allow President Omar al-Bashir to run for a third term in 2020 elections. Unless the constitution is changed, Mr Bashir, who came to power in a coup in 1989, will not be allowed to stand again â€“ as a two-term limit was introduced in 2005. Parliament speaker Ibrahim Ahmed Omar said he had received a letter signed by a majority of lawmakers backing an amendment that would extend the limit. He said it came from 33 parties representing 294 deputies.
