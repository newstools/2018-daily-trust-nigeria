The Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) has said it sealed Banex Plaza, Wuse II, Abuja, over failure of tenants to pay waste bills owed the board. “It is a verifiable fact that Banex Plaza tenants owe AEPB huge sums of money running into millions of naira accumulated over several years in spite of several notices they have chosen to ignore serially,”the board’s Head of Information and Outreach Program Unit, Mukhtar Ibrahim said in a statement yesterday. “Instead of claiming targeted victimization by AEPB, the Banex shop owners should pay up their accumulated debts promptly in the same way they expect payments from their numerous customers,” he said. He called on the tenants to understand that laws were made to be obeyed not ignored. “They are therefore advised not to stir up trouble through deliberate falsehood but to instead do the needful and save everyone from unnecessary inconvenience, particularly their numerous customers.  “AEPB seeks the cooperation of all FCT residents including the  Banex Plaza managers but it will not succumb to any form of intimidation or blackmail,” the statement read.
