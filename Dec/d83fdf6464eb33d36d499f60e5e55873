Wife of the President, Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, has empowered 11,600 women and youth in Akwa Ibom State under her Future Assured Programme. The empowerment programme was organised in partnership with the National Directorate of Employment (NDE). Flagging off the programme in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, the Presidentâ€™s wife restated her resolve to contribute to the reduction of the level of poverty in the country, ensuring self-reliance among Nigerian women. In a statement by her media aide, Suleiman Haruna, she said that 1,500 women and youths would be trained on vocational skills, while 1,000 others undergoing training would be given starter packs and the sum of N5,000 each. She announced disbursement of interest-free loan to 1,000 beneficiaries, issuance of basic training certificates to 5,000 persons as well as other schemes as part of the empowerment package. Senator Ita Enang, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Legislative Matters, said beneficiaries were selected across party lines after evaluation of their applications which he said, were submitted online. Director-General of the NDE, Dr. Nasiru Muhammad Ladan, said the best way to reduce poverty was to target rural areas.
