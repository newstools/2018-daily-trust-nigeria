The Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Kwali General Hospital, Dr. Halima Lawal Bello, has received the National Association of University Students’ (NAUS) award of excellence. The national president of NAUS, Comrade Sagir Adam, who led other executives of the union to present the award to the medical director last Thursday in Kwali, said the nomination was made during the association’s end of year meeting at University of Jos, Plateau State. He said the association later set up a three-man committee which came to the hospital to make findings and also interact with residents of Kwali town, who confirmed that the medical director has performed excellently in terms of healthcare service delivery. Dr. Bello commended the association for finding her worthy for the award, saying the award would inspire her to do more. “Honestly, I never take this award as serious the first time I learnt that I have been nominated for it, until after several enquiries that I came to discover that the students  union had actually taken record of our achievements,” she said. The award ceremony which was held at the hospital premises, was attended by the Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo, and some prominent personalities  in the area.
