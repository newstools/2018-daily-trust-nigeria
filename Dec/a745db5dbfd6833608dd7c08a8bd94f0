The Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has told Nigerian politicians not to rely on prophecy to win elections but to embark on issue-based campaigns so as to gain the confidence of the electorate. The bishops say that running from one pastor or reverend father to the other seeking for miracles or prophetic messages of victory does not translate to votes. In their New Year message, signed by the President CBCN, Most Rev. Augustine Obiora Akubueze, the bishops urged politicians to engage meaningfully with the people and sell their programmes instead of hoping on miracles to win votes. Rev. Akubueze said Nigerians would judge the quality of candidates for the different political offices during the 2019 elections. The cleric also warned pastors to remember that the pulpit is only for the propagation of the kingdom of God and not for partisan politics. He said, “we look forward with hope to 2019, a year when Nigerians will judge the quality of the candidates for political offices through their track records and not votes based on declaration of prophecy by men of God,” adding, “the church must remain non-partisan and refrain from endorsing candidates  as it does not help the growth of the church.” How 2019 elections are becoming ‘religious’ Catholic bishops ban priests, members from ‘active politics’ Catholic Bishops ban priests, members from ‘active politics’
