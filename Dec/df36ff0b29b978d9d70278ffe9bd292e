An elder statesman and Chairman of Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) Board of Trustees, Balarabe Musa has said there were only two types of people that are not corrupt in Nigeria. According to him, the whole system of governance in Nigeria is corrupt, which made it very difficult to identify individuals that are not corrupt across the country. Balarabe Musa made the comment i‎n Kaduna while reacting to the comment made by President Muhammadu Buhari about the corrupt system in the country. “In fact, the whole system is corrupt, Nobody knows who is not corrupt in Nigeria,” he said. “The only two people that are not corrupt in Nigeria are those who have no access to corruption and those, who by their nature, will rather die than to be corrupt but this constitute less than 00.1 percent of Nigerians. “So, the corrupt people are either corrupt knowingly or unknowingly, intentionally or unintentionally or somehow.” The elder statesman further explained that those who prefer to die than to be corrupt were very small in number in the country. “These are negligible few in Nigeria and since the system is made up of corrupt people who always like to steal either knowingly or unknowingly, you expect all sorts of things to happen in Nigeria. We are only surviving like animals in the forest,” he said.
