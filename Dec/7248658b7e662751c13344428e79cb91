The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) operations office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has met with its stakeholders to review their activities for the year and strategise for next year. At the meeting, the head of NEMA, Abuja operations office, Mr. Bitrus Samuel, said responding to emergencies required multi-agency efforts as teamwork is needed in emergency situations. He said the meeting would allow the agency and its stakeholders make changes, close gaps and improve on their actions where necessary and apply them whenever the need arose. Samuel added that the meeting was also intended to synthesise lessons learned from previous responses to four major emergencies; flood, building collapse, fire at a filing station and the Air Force Fighter Jet crash in the FCT. “We must identify possible hazards and risks, anticipate their possible occurrence, plan and prepare adequately towards them, so that our responses will be swift, appropriate and adequate,” he said. Personnel of the Federal Fire Service, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps amongst other stakeholders attended the meeting.
