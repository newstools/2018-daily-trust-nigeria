Stakeholders in the transport sector have enjoined the Federal Government to adopt the emerging Skyway transport technology for the country. Speaking during a summit on the technology, yesterday, in Abuja, they said it has many benefits for the transport system of the country. The technology is based on an innovative composite rail mounted on a pre-stressed string-rail overpass. String-rail transport uses lightweight modules and multiple units with traction motors for both passenger and freight transport.   The Secretary, Transportation Secretariat, Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Comrade Kayode Opeifa, said any transportation technology that reduces transportation challenges such as environmental pollution, congestion and accidents is needed in any city, particularly a modern city like Abuja. “Skyway is an emerging technology that will make movement of people and goods easier and government should key into it. I recommend it for the country and worldwide,” said Opeifa who was represented by Mr Alebiosu Adewale, Deputy Director, Mass Transit, FCTA. The convener of the summit and master partner, Skyway Capital, the investment arm of Skyway Group of Companies, Charles Umar, said Nigeria should adopt the technology considering the number of deaths recorded on roads, and huge amounts spent constructing and repairing roads. The Africa Regional Head, Skyway, Arogundade Samsondeen, said the transport system was invented in 1978 by a Russian engineer, who envisioned a mobility system that would not pollute the air, have zero accident rate, and also produce renewable energy.
