Gana, who was at the SDP national secretariat in Abuja yesterday on a courtesy call on party leaders, sought the endorsement of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) to unveil his key five-point agenda code named ‘SWIFT.’ He said  having submitted his nomination form to INEC through the party, “I know that being a very disciplined and organised party, the form will be taken to INEC.” According to him, “We now want to first of all meet with the various stakeholders because our campaign is going to be connected. Candidates are going to campaign with us, governorship candidates, the senatorial, House of Representatives and House of Assembly candidates as well so there’s going to be network of campaigning.” Earlier  while receiving the presidential candidate on behalf of the NWC in his office, the SDP Deputy National Chairman, Dr Abdul Isiaq said as a discplined party, the SDP would comply with the court judgement.
