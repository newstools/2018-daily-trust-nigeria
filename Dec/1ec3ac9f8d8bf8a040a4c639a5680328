Tension gripped residents of the Ajilosun area of Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, yesterday when unknown gunmen shot and killed an unidentified motorist in the area. It was gathered from eyewitnesses that the incident occurred about 6.15am when the man, said to be driving along the Ado-Ikere highway, was shot in front of the popular Tosin Aluko motor park at Ajilosun. Our correspondent observed that the deceased was shot in the head and stomach. The corpse was yet to be removed at 9am when journalists visited the scene. He was later evacuated by policemen from the Ologede police station and taken to the morgue of the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti. A source at the scene of the incident said, “The deceased was in his car when the vehicle conveying the gunmen hit the car from the back at that spot. The deceased then alighted from the car to complain over the reckless driving, not knowing they were assassins. The bandits opened fire on him and he died immediately. The killers then sped away.” Men of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), who had reported for work at the park, fled the environment to avoid indiscriminate arrest by the police. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti command, Deputy Superintendent Caleb Ikechukwu, confirmed the incident. The police spokesman said, “We have got a report about the killing and our men have swung into action. We are yet to know the identity of the deceased, but investigation has begun into the killing.” Pandemonium as Gunmen kill man in Ekiti Drivers protest over colleague’s arraignment for rudeness to Fayose How gunmen killed Alex Badeh
