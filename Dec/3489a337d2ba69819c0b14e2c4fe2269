A three-year-old son of a police officer has been abducted by some unknown people in Tunga Maje, an Abuja suburb. The boy, identified as Destiny, was abducted on Saturday at about 2pm in Dan Kusa area in the community. A source close to the family, Ikaka Ochoche, said the boy was playing with another boy from the same compound close to a shop in the area when they were approached  by some men. He said one of the men gave the second boy of about four years old, N210 to buy him a recharge card of N200 and use N10 to buy himself a balloon. “On the way to buy the card, he looked back and saw the men take his playmate away.  While the boy was going to get the recharge card, someone who knew his father told him to return home. On reaching where he left his friend, he did not see the boy and the guys. He then cried home to his mother,” Ochoche said. The father, David Joseph, a police officer serving with the FCT Police Command, said the boy was yet to be found when he spoke  to our reporter via telephone yesterday. He said the case has been transferred from Zuba Police division to the Force CID, where he was with his wife when our reporter called him.
