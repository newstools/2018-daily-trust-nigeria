The gubernatorial candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Adamawa State, Emmanuel Bello, has alleged that the APC-led government in the state has  failed “woefully in tackling security issues.”  He made the allegation during the unveiling of his 10-point agenda in Yola where he assured that if elected as governor, the security of lives and property would be prioritised. Bello said he would also deploy community heads to dialogue in resolving farmers/herders crises. He promised to deploy personalities with the competence to chart a new course for the state which, according to him, was experiencing monumental crisis as a result of continued failed leadership. “Adamawa State has experienced monumental and paradoxical crisis of continuous failed leadership that has not met up with the basic needs of the people of the state. “Successive governments were and are still embedded in weakness of poor stewardship largely because of weak capacity of governance, misplaced political interests and lost focus on human value system,” he said.
