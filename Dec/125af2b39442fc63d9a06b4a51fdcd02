Qatar, the world’s top Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exporter, on Monday, said it was quitting the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) from January, 2019, but will attend the oil exporter group’s meeting this week. Qatar said the decision was not political but related to the country’s long-term strategy and plan to develop its gas industry and increase LNG output by 2024. The country, which is one of the smallest oil producers in OPEC, has been locked in a diplomatic dispute with the group’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, but said the move to leave OPEC was not driven by politics. Minister of State for Energy Affairs, Saad al-Kaabi, told a news conference that Qatar would still attend the group’s meeting on Thursday and Friday this week. “Qatar has decided to withdraw its membership from OPEC effective January 2019 and this decision was communicated to OPEC this morning,” the minister said. Qatar has oil output of only 600,000 barrels per day (bpd), compared with the 11 million bpd produced by Saudi Arabia, the group’s biggest oil producer and world’s biggest exporter. But Doha is an influential player in the global LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes per year. Al-Kaabi, who is heading Qatar’s OPEC delegation, said the decision was not political, however, OPEC members, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and fellow Arab states, Bahrain and Egypt, imposed a political and economic boycott on Qatar since June 2017. They are accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism. OPEC members meet today to decide on output, others OPEC to maintain current oil output Arab oil ministers predict stable global market in 2014
