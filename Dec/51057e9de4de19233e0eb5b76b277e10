The Nasarawa State government says it has resolved to implement any amount arrived at as new minimum wage for workers. Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of Al-Makura made this known while swearing-in 11 newly appointed commissioners and the Director Generals of Nasarawa Geographic Information Service (NAGIS) and Nasarawa State Market Management Bureau (NSMMB). He said: “This was predicated upon the conviction that if our mandate, encapsulated in our policies and programmes, is to serve the people, then the public servant who is the nerve centre of policy implementation must be given his dues”. According to him, as they are awaiting the final decision on the review of the national minimum wage, he assured the workers that his administration will be among the first states to implement any decision reached by the Federal Government. Governor Almakura however, he had directed for the implementation of the promotion of deserving workers in the State, saying that it was his belief that it would strengthen the machinery of government for optimal productivity. Meanwhile, the governor has lifted the ban on employment in the state after several years, saying “in our resolve to expand the frontiers of policy implementation, also, we have lifted the ban on employment. “In this regard, we have demonstrated our commitment to reinvigorate the Service in the recent employment of teachers into our public schools in the State. I, therefore, encourage eligible citizens to apply for vacant positions in the Civil Service”.
