Not dettered by his disability, Malam Yahaya Alhassan, a 25-year-old one-limb man is defying the odds by hawking  goods along Ahmadu Bello Way  in Kaduna. Malam Yahaya, who started hawking goods three years ago, told Arewa Trust that he was hopeful that by struggling  he would be able to change his fortunes for the better rather than becoming a begger. “I started this business three years ago because being handicap is not an excuse for me to beg or ask someone to give me something. So I decided to go out and look for something to do to help myself and my parent. “I used the little money I had to start the business and Alhamdullilah, people patronize me.’’ He, however, said it was sometimes difficult to get customers for his goods because some people believed it is cheaper to buy in the market than along the roads. “It takes one to two days before  somebody buys something from me,’’ he said. He urged the youth to go out and look for something to do rather than wait for a white collar job. “It is for their benefit.  If anyone makes an effort,  God will definitely help that person.” Inside the world of roadside booksellers Reminiscences with Alhaji Nasiru Ahli Isma’il Recharge card sellers: Different strokes for different folks
