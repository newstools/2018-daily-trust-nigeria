A 32-year-old labourer identified only as Usman has been crushed by a tipper on Dukpa road in Gwagwalada town. A witness said the incident happened, yesterday, when a tipper loaded with sand coming from Dukpa village lost control and crashed the deceased who was digging a drainage by the side of  the road. He said the tipper veered off the road and hit the deceased, adding that the front tyres of the tipper crushed Usman and he died on the spot. “Some people around tried to save the man when the front tyres of the tipper trapped him but unfortunately there was no way out. The man cried for help until he gave up,” he said. He said  officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) later came and removed the trapped body after the tipper was emptied of sand. When contacted, the Gwagwalada unit commander of the FRSC, ACC Sunday Attah, confirmed the incident, saying the remains of the deceased had been handed over to relatives for burial, while the tipper driver was handed over to the police.
