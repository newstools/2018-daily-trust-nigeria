The Head of Economics Department, University of Abuja, Dr Isa Mohammed, has said allotting  only N2.031 trillion for capital expenditure may not make much impact on the economy. Speaking with Daily Trust in Abuja, Dr Mohammed said given that it is the capital expenditures that “jumpstart the economy” allotting such amount to it might not make its impact felt in the near future. He is also concerned that one-fourth of the budget (N2.14 trillion) will be used for debt servicing noting that “this shows that the recent debt government has been incurring is not healthy for the economy.’’ “It is good to borrow money but these monies should be judiciously utilised and invested in critical infrastructure,” he added. But Dr Mohammed said government might have made the recurrent expenditure high – almost half the total budget – because “government may be putting into consideration the N30,000 minimum wage, and the cost of governance.’’ He urged government to do all things possible to reduce the rate of inflation as it is gearing towards two digits. He also prayed that the budget be fully implemented which, he however said was quite unlikely because of the upcoming elections. “Government should be faithful if they truly want to see the economy grow. The capital releases should be adequately released and utilised judiciously,” he said. However, another economist and business analyst, Binta Yahya, said the budget is realistic and if all goes well, it should save the economy. ‘Nigeria’s borrowing in 2018 budget must be self-liquidating’ Buhari presents N8.8trn budget As Buhari presents 2016 budget today
