Over 40 opposition parties under the umbrella of Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) have resolved to adopt Opposition Code 20, if President Muhammadu Buhari failed to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law. The amendment if signed into law would make the use of card reader statutory and the only instrument of accreditation thereby permanently doing away with the use of incident form. The parties said they were worried that it was 71 days to the opening of the 2019 ballot and in less than 72 hours, the 30 days time limit allowed by law for Buhari to assent to the bill would elapse. Senate Leader: No cause for alarm over Electoral Act Bill The Code is enshrined in Section 20, of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act which allows citizens to perform policing duties of arrest, according to the coalition. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday in Abuja, the Spokesman of the Coalition, Ikenga Ugochinyere flanked by leaders of other opposition parties expressed fear that if the amendment was not signed, the elections would end up the most violent in the nation’s recent history. He said the Opposition Code 20 would be used as a neutralisation strategy which will check the mayhem and violence allegedly being plotted by the presidency and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to rig or manipulate results of the elections. “It is now about 28 days since the National Assembly forwarded to the President and for the fourth time necessary amendments to our Electoral Act. The President has not signed the amendment. We are also sad to say this to you, that there is intelligence that President Buhari has agreed with his kitchen cabinet not to sign the amendment into law.
