The Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, to stop abusing him and ex-President, Olusegun Obasanjo. Gov. Okorocha lamented  the manner Oshiomhole had been allegedly abusing sitting governors and Obasanjo, saying it was unbecoming of any chairman of a political party with a national outlook. Okorocha, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, accused Oshiomhole of “taking rascality too far.” He said, “We won’t take the pain to begin to talk about all the abuses (of Oshiomhole), but to humbly plead with President Muhammadu Buhari, who is the leader of the party, to call Oshiomhole to order. “The party’s national chairman has, in less than six months, enthroned the culture of rascality into the party and the development is not good for the party. APC is not known for rascality and abuses. And the earlier he is called to order the better for the party,” Okorocha said. He said since Buhari became president, he never used any foul language on any Nigerian, low or high, saying that was the best way to go, and therefore, asked Oshiomhole to borrow a leaf from the president. He added that, “One of the reasons the PDP lost in 2015 was the abuses the handlers of the party then were heaping on the APC presidential candidate…Oshiomhole should be advised not to tow the 2015 PDP line. “Chief Olusegun Obasanjo is a former president of the country. And no matter the provocation or his political activities this time, Oshiomhole should have considered his status as a former president of the country in talking about him, and should have exercised caution in addressing him. Saying that God will punish the former president is never advisable; this should not be the language of APC.”
