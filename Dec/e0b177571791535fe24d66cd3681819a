Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbanjo and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday attended the wedding of daughter of former Bauchi State Governor, Alhaji Adamu Mu’azu, in Bauchi. The marriage was attended by traditional rulers, political and business associates of Alhaji Mu’azu who was a former National Chairman of the PDP. The former governor returned to the country for the wedding after the PDP lost the 2015 Presidential elections to the All Progressives Congress (APC). However, the presence of Atiku and Osinbajo at the wedding left many wondering as to what will be the next move of the former PDP chairman. Many believed that the PDP and APC may be looking for an avenue to woo Mu’azu to their side towards the 2019 presidential election. At the state level, many also believed that with his coming, many political calculations will change, knowing the political strength and the support being enjoyed by the former governor.
