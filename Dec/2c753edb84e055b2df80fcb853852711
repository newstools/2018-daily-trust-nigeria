No fewer than 140 young candidates seeking for different elective positions from the North West zone of the country under the aegis of Young Aspirants Leadership Fellowship (YALF) attended a 3-day training programme organised by the Young Leadership Initiative (YLI) in Kano. The goal of the training, according to the Executive Director of YLI, Mr Kingsley Bangwell, was to increase the capacity of the aspirants in the area of community mobilisation, fund raising, campaign strategy as well as media engagement so as to be successful in the forthcoming elections. “We have discovered that a lot of young people are interested in public office. They want to run for office and they want to go there to make impact, but the skills, capacity and knowledge required to effectively run, win and make impact are deficient,” he said. Bangwell added that the idea of training the young aspirants began in 2014 when the pilot test training was conducted and participants were able to give feedback of their experiences. “Now we have a greater number of young people that have become more aware of their civic right and are more interested in engaging in the political space,” he said. “We got funding from Ford Foundation West Africa to train these young aspirants and the goal is to increase the participation and space for youth emergence in elective positions,” he added. One of the participants, Zainab Sulaiman Umar, said she was contesting to give women a voice in the Kano State House of Assembly. “Women are not represented in the state assembly and men are the ones making laws that affect the women,” she said.
