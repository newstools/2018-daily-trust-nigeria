The Nigeria Police Force, on Wednesday, denied plans to arrest and kill Senator Dino Melaye. A statement by Police spokesman, DCP Jimooh Moshood said a statement attributed to Senator Dino Melaye, captioned “IG plans to arrest me, inject me to death,” is false. Moshood said: “The Force is categorically stating that the statement is mischievous, malicious, capable of misleading the public and laughable.” He added that, “there was no such order from the Inspector General of Police or any plan by the Force to arrest Senator Dino Melaye and inject him to death.” However, the Police said: “But if the Senator knows he had committed any crime or he is aware of his involvement in any crime, he should come out and confess and face the legal consequences instead of whipping up sentiments to distract the public.” “The Force sees such defamatory, mischievous, malicious and reckless statement by Senator Dino Melaye as untrue, ridiculous, mischievous and unfortunate.” Moshood added that: “Members of the public are hereby enjoined to disregard and discountenance the statement by Senator Dino Melaye in its entirety as untrue and mischievous.” He also said Melaye should know that his statement constitute a criminal defamatory offence, hate speech and hateful conduct. “He should however, as a law maker, be law abiding and desist from un-senatorial and lawless utterances that cannot be substantiated with facts. “The Inspector General of Police will not be distracted by statements from the likes of Senator Dino Melaye but will continue to ensure that the rule of law prevails in all matters,” the police stated.
