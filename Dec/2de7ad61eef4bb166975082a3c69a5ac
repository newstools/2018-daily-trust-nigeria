The family of the late vice chairman of Abaji Area Council, Mohammed Rizoma, have demanded for the vice chairman’s slot to fill the vacuum created by his death. A member of the family, Yunusa Agbagi, made the request during the three days Fidda’u prayers for the late vice chairman, which was attended the council chairman, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, village chiefs, imams and top party stalwarts in attendance at Adagba village of the council on Saturday. Agbagi, who is the chief imam of the community, noted that if any member of the deceased family was picked to retain the vice chairman’s slot, it would give the entire family a sense of belonging. “I request before the chairman to consider picking any member of our family to retain the vice chairman’s slot even if it is for the remaining five months,” he said. He commended the council chairman, security agents and members of the vigilante for their efforts in ensuring that the body of the vice chairman was found. Also speaking, the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, called on clerics around the area to continue to pray for the repose of the sound of the late vice chairman. While responding to the family on their request to retain the vice chairman’s slot, he said “there is nothing wrong about their demand for the vice chairman’s slot but it is something I have to make consultation on before taking decision.” Kuje council vice chairman loses father God will expose killers of my deputy - Abaji chair Abaji v’chair’s corpse found 10 days after abduction
