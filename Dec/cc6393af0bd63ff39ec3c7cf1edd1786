The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the plan by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to create polling centers in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps within the country to allow them vote in the 2019 general elections. Addressing a press conference on Friday in Abuja, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said Nigerians displaced from their original areas of registration should be made to transfer their voting rights to an exiting statutory polling center near their IDP camp. The PDP argued that creating polling centers in IDP camps was a plot hatched by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in connivance with INEC to rig the general elections. “For the purposes of emphasis, the PDP rejects all forms of fraudulent ‘special arrangements’ tailored to rig this election. Our party insists that elections must only hold in statutorily designated polling centers across our country. “The PDP and indeed, Nigerians are not ready to accept any fabricated result from any illegal polling center created to assist President Buhari to rig the election,” Ologbondiyan said. The PDP alleged that the presidency had directed INEC to circumvent the checks by secretly opening illegal voting centers at the desert fringes and remote border lines with Chad and Niger, and use them to achieve its original plans to rig the presidential election.
