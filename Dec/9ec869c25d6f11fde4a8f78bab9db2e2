The National Chairman of All the Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Dr. Victor Ike Oye, has said that 2019 will bring abundance, wealth and health for all Nigerians. In his New Year message released in Abuja on Monday, Dr. Oye predicted that 2019 would be better than 2018 in many aspects, especially in the general welfare of Nigerians. According to him, his optimism was based on the fact that God who Nigerians serve is a merciful and gracious God that will not allow his people to suffer unduly. He was quoted in the statement by the party’s National Director of Publicity, Ifeanacho Oguejiofor, as expressing hope that some of the fiscal measures introduced by the federal government in the outgoing year would begin to bear fruit. He also urged Nigerians to remain prayerful and continue to live in peace and harmony with one another. “2018 as a very excruciating year for many Nigerians, I urged those that went through one sad experience or another to continue to look at the bright side of life, because no condition in life is permanent,” Oye said. He urged INEC not to dash the hope of Nigerians in the electoral process by ensuring that the 2019 general elections is free and fair.
