The immediate past Minister of State for Environment, Alhaji Ibrahim Usman Jibrin yesterday said no school can give anybody the knowledge he learnt under President Muhammadu Buhari in three years. Jibrin resigned from the Federal cabinet yesterday following his emergence as the Emir of Nasarawa in Nasarawa State last week. A valedictory session was held in his honour during yesterday’s Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. “The last three years has been full of activities and I must thank Almighty God for given us the strength and courage to serve under your wonderful leadership. There is no doubt that I have personally learnt a lot from you, your commitment to the entire nation and the desire to fight corruption to a standstill. We have learnt a lot from these sterling qualities. No school can give anybody such knowledge. It is therefore wonderful experience for us,” he said. He said his experience in the Environment Ministry has changed his perception about the country, saying there is no part of the country that has no environmental issue in one way or the other. On Ogoni clean-up, he said letters would be issued to 16 contractors today to commence remediation works at different locations. According to him, no president has signed instrument of ratification on environment more than President Buhari since the establishment of the ministry in year 2000. He said President Buhari has signed four instruments of ratification and that two others are in the offing. Who’s Rep Abdulmumin Jibrin?
