The Force Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), Major General Adeyemi Yekini, on Friday said his troops repelled some gunmen who invaded parts of Logo local government area of Benue state. In a statement made available to newsmen in Makurdi, General Yekini disclosed that the troops of OPWS engaged the attackers in gun duel in an overnight operation carried out between Thursday night and early hours of Friday. He explained that during the operation, the troops encountered and destroyed an open camp set up by the gunmen along the bank of River Benue at Anyiibe in Logo LGA, adding that in the process, some of the armed elements who attempted to cross back into Nasarawa state got their boat capsized during the exchange of fire. “It is therefore likely that the armed group might have suffered some casualties during the encounter. However, our troops that participated in the operation did not sustain any casualty and no civilian was killed during the incident,” he stated. The Force Commander therefore urged the public to disregard any list of purported civilian casualties being circulated by some people describing the report as fake. He insisted that, “the rumour being peddled by some people that armed herdsmen killed four or more people in Logo local government area earlier today is not true.” BREAKING: Soldiers, militias in fresh gun battle in Benue Soldiers, militias in fresh gun battle in Benue Soldiers kill Ghana’s wife in Benue
