The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Yusuf Tukur Buratai, has demanded an increased funding of the Nigerian military for its being ‘in a state of war’. He made the appeal while addressing editors and defence correspondents at a dinner and interactive session in Maiduguri on Saturday. Buratai, who said government was doing a lot to meet armed forces demands, stressed that more needed to be done, given the involvement of the military in various security operations. “Like other institutions in the country, we do not have all the resources we require to as we wish, but there is no doubt government is doing all it could to ensure we are well trained, equipped to carry out our duties. “However, considering that we are in a state of war, there is the need to further enhance the funding of the military,” he said. He also asked the media and members of the public to continue to support the army in its efforts to make everyone safe. “We should always remember that while the rest of us sleep in our air-conditioned rooms, the soldiers are out there ensuring that nothing untoward happens to us. The institution that does this, deserves the total support of the media and, indeed, all Nigerians,” he said. The Chief of Army Staff, while commending Nigerians, noted that the deployment of troops for various internal security operations had brought them into close interaction with the public, a situation that was affecting ‘professionalism and relationship’ with members the public. “We appreciate the public’s continued support, encouragement and understanding as we deal with the myriad of security challenges in this country,” he said. 2019: Remain apolitical, Buratai advises officers Killings: Army chief blames ‘internal and external forces’ Military better off under democratic rule, says COAS
