New executives of the Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) FCT chapter were yesterday inaugurated at the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the territory. Speaking at the inauguration, FCT IPAC chairman, Alhaji AbdulRahman Ndagi, said he was happy to be returned as the chairman. He said the executives would collaborate with the electoral body and other stakeholders to ensure that the 2019 elections were peaceful and credible. He said the council would also embark on rigorous sensitisation to ensure that the electorate collected their permanent voters cards before the election. “As it is well known, all the states have their IPAC so FCT is not left out and we are going to serve as a mediator between political parties that are registered with FCT,” he said. In his remarks, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, commended IPAC for the peaceful election that ushered in the new executives, adding that the council was a veritable platform that would ensure sustainable, constructive political engagement between political parties and the commission. The REC tasked the newly inaugurated executives to quickly swing into action on sensitising the electorate on the need to collect their PVCs as there were several cards yet to be collected. “Very soon the commission will commence the invitation of critical stakeholders for consultation in preparation for the 2019 general elections,” he said.
