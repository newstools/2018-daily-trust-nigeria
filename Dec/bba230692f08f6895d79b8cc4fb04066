The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breaders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) says the Fulani extractions in the country are of good character and integrity, but immigrant herdsmen are damaging their reputation. He said that armed Fulani herdsmen terrorizing people are not Nigerians. Chairman of MACBAN, Giwa Council, Ibrahim Abubakar, was fielding questions from journalists yesterday at a retreat organized for the leaderships of the group from  23 councils of the state on security challenges encountered by cattle rearers in the state. According to him, “Not all Fulanis are bad, there are many good people among us, but those pastoralists coming from neighbouring countries are the ones spoiling our name. We are people of integrity and good character, but these people have come and damaged our reputation.” Abubakar said cattle rearers in Giwa council and other parts of Kaduna state are facing a lot of security challenges, ranging from cattle rustling, destruction of property and killings. He stated: “The bandits are always coming to kill us and rustle away our cows. They have been coming to destroy our properties as well. This issue has become a critical one that requires state of emergency.” While speaking, state chairman of MACBAN, Alhaji Haruna Usman, urged his members to be vigilant and fish out evil perpetrators in their area. “We, from Miyetti Allah, are distancing ourselves from the insecurity issues, and we have been calling on our people to ensure that if they are living with someone whose ways are not pure, they should notify the security agents and if they are afraid of informing security agents, they should come and tell us so that we can do that”, he said.
