Oshiomhole stated this in Lafia, Nasarawa State, while presenting the APC flag to its gubernatorial candidate, Engineer Audu Sule, and his deputy, Dr. Emmanuel Agabe. “The 16 wasteful years of PDP are being remedied in three years by the taming of corruption and bad international image for the country due to PDP’s bad governance,” he said. According to him, the international community has been praising the change agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari for turning around the country from negative to positive light. In his remarks, a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, said President Muhammadu Buhari needed support of the electorate to vote APC candidates in all elections to enable him to continue developing the country without saboteurs. Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura said APC in Nasarawa State remained a united family and solidly behind President Muhammadu Buhari, saying they were in tune with the leadership style of Oshiomhole.
