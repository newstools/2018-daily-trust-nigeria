The National Sugar Development Council (NSDC) has said the N12 billion it domiciled in development finance institutions for lending to sugar operators is not enough to meet the capital requirements in the sugar industry. Speaking, yesterday, at a media chat in Abuja, the Executive Secretary of NSDC, Dr Latif Busari, described the sugar industry as “capital intensive” with a gestation period of about 5 years for returns to manifest. He said the council has N6.4bn with the Bank of Industry (BOI) and an additional N2.4bn which it is about to disburse. He said  the total fund with BOI is N8.4bn. The NSDC’s boss said the council also has N3.2 billion with the Bank of Agriculture (BOA) out of which it plans to disburse N1.5 billion to an investor. He said smuggling has cut sugar operators’ import targets by about 50 per cent – from 1.55 million metric tons to about 800,000 metric tons this year. He said the drop in import targets indicated that smugglers had taken the market from sugar operators and though Customs has been trying to curb it, the porous nature of the nation’s borders remained a challenge. The “Customs is doing its best but, apparently, the best is not enough,” he stated. He said from the council’s survey, it found industrial sugar that was not safe for consumption was smuggled into the country and sold in markets across Nigeria, including Abuja and Kano. “Every sugar smuggled into the country translates to loss of jobs to Nigeria,” he said, adding that the ban on sugar import had had “zero impact” on the sugar industry as smugglers have found ways to cheat the checks put in place to track importation.
