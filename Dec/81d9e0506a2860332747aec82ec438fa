The Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai on Friday announced the  language allowance pay for soldiers who are proficient in the three major  indigenous languages: Ibo, Yoruba and Hausa. Buratai made this known at the graduation ceremony of the 3rd set of participants of the Nigeria Army Indigenous languages Course  at the Army Resource Centre in Abuja. Buratai, who was represented by the Chief of Logistics (Army), Major General Enobong Udoh, said those certified by finishing the course are now entitled to language allowance. He added that in order to continue earning the allowance they must pass the language test every year. He said the course is just the first step of actualizing the Nigerian Army Language Policy adding that soldiers must continue to practice. He explained that the Nigeria Army has troops deployed in every region of the country on internal security operations and proficiency in the major indigenous language is a prerequisite for effective operations. He said the dynamic nature of the security environment has made intelligence gathering important and is enhanced when soldiers are proficient in the indigenous languages. He noted that conflict resolution and information dissemination is better when soldiers understand the nuances of the indigenous language where they are deployed. The course participants included officers and soldiers from units and formations across the country.
