For 15 years, there was no electricity in Aratumi-Omun, a community at Ipole-Omun in Olorunda Local Government, Osogbo, capital of Osun State. The Chairman of the Aratumi-Omun Community Association, Mr Ibrahim Sunday told Daily Trust that the electrification of the community was achieved with the help of Osun State Agency for Community and Social Development Project (CSDP). When the 300KV transformer was installed and the community was connected, as they sighted the light, the community dwellers rolled out drum to celebrate the feat.
