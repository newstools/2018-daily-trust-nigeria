Ten political parties in Ogun state have rejected the reported endorsement of the governorship candidate of the Allied People’s Movement, Adekunle Akinlade by the Intra-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) in the state. The parties include Better Nigerian People’s Party; Freedom and Justice Party; National Action Congress; National Democratic Liberty Party and Masses Movement of Nigeria. Others are: All Blending Party; People’s Progressives Party; Advance Congress of Democrats; Democratic People’s Congress and Progressives People’s Alliance. The spokesman of the aggrieved parties under the aegis of Political Parties Chairmen Forum, Olusegun Olufemi, told newsmen on Wednesday in Abeokuta that they were not a party to the said adoption of Akinlade, who is the anointed candidate of Governor Ibikunle Amosun. He said  the  forum had sent a petition to the national chairman of IPAC, High Chief Peter Ameh, against Abayomi Arabambi- led exco. The forum in  the petition dated December 24 and signed by  all the ten political parties, accused the executive  members of the state chapter of IPAC of misconduct, abuse of office and engaging in actions inimical to the parties constituting IPAC in the state. Olufemi said: “We reject in totality the adoption of any governorship candidate. We urge members of the public to disregard the purported adoption of any political party’s candidate. “Calls have started going round about the adoption of the APM governorship candidate by IPAC. “I want to state clearly that we did not adopt anyone since we also have our own governorship candidates. So, we have come here today to debunk any of such claims. “We are not part of the APM adoption and that adoption holds no water and it can’t stand.” Amosun's candidates, Adebutu lose out, as Abiodun, Bankole make list Ogun: Labour Party lures Amosun's candidate with guber ticket Akinlade's defection shocking, says Ogun APC Chair
