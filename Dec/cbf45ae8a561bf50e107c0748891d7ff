Speaking to journalists at State House, Abuja during the launching of Africa Youth Congress Against Corruption by President Muhammadu Buhari, he said nobody would be spared. “By the grace of God, all those candidates who have cases with us will be charged to court before the election. I don’t want to personalize it,” he said.
