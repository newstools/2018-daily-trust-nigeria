A forum of the zonal and state youth leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has kicked against the list of the party’s Presidential Campaign Committee released by the presidency on Friday. In a statement signed by the North-Central youth leader, Comrade Terver Aginde, on behalf of all the zonal and states youth leaders, the forum said the APC leadership had continued to downgrade them despite their sacrifice and contribution to the party. Aginde threatened to mobilise all the APC youths to fight what he described as injustice against the youth wing of the ruling party. “We the zonal youths and states youth leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC), after carefully studying the presidential campaign committee list, we are saying that the list has no interest of the youth wing of the party at heart and we will not accept anything short of totally been in charge of the Youth Directorate from the national, zonal and state levels of the party. “We have made sacrifice and shown commitment to the party and we deserve a good deal. We are ready to mobilize ourselves to fight for this injustice and exclusiveness if nothing is done quickly. “We constitute the highest percentage of the voting strength, if all the zonal women leaders will be included in the campaign team, we see no reason why the youth leaders should not be included,” the statement read.
