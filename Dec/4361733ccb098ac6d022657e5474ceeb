The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikanti Baru, has felicitated with Nigerians from all walks of life on the occasion of the New Year. A statement on Monday in Abuja by NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, said Dr. Baru wished the nation’s compatriots and their loved ones a joyous and prosperous New Year. The statement disclosed that the NNPC GMD had in place adequate arrangements to guarantee steady products supply across the country to meet consumers’ demand in the New Year and beyond. Dr. Baru, in the statement, also advised motorists and other consumers of petroleum products against panic buying, saying the corporation holds a stock of 30billion litres of petrol and 90,000 metric tonnes of kerosene, expected to last 60 days, assuming no fresh consignment is added. The GMD clarified that the price of petrol remains N145 per litre, admonishing petroleum products consumers to report any station which sells above the recommended price to any offices of the Industry regulatory agency, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) or other law enforcement agencies, for appropriate sanction. The NNPC’s helmsman admonished communities hosting the corporation’s facilities, such as pipelines, pump stations, among others, to restrain their wards from tampering with the national assets to guard against fire incidents, instances of which he noted, were recorded in some parts of the country in recent times due to the unwholesome acts of some individuals in the communities.
