The Chairman  of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, has boasted that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will be defeated in the March 16, 2019 council election by the ruling APC in the area. Ajiya stated this while addressing over 800 former members of the PDP in Gurdi ward of the council that defected to the ruling APC at a ceremony held at the council secretariat on Saturday. He said there were some moles in the APC who were secretly working for the PDP ahead of next year’s council election, saying such people should rather come out openly to do so before they would be put to shame as APC would emerge victorious. “I want to inform all members and supporters of APC here that there are some people who are working secretly for PDP. I want to call on such people to come out openly because by God’s grace, such people and PDP will be defeated on election day, “ he said. He further boasted that the ruling APC had come to stay in Abaji, adding that it would make history again as it did in the PDP era when it held sway and won all the 10 wards councillorship in the area during the administration of Alhaji Hassan Sokodabo in 2001. The chairman commended the PDP defectors for their courage and boldness to pitch tent with the APC, assuring them that his administration would carry them along and treat them equally with other members of the party in the area. A former PDP ward leader in Gawu ward, Alhaji Adamu Rafin Daji, said he decided to lead 853 members of the PDP into APC because of neglect by the opposition party in the area. He said the opposition party had abandoned him and his followers since the inception of democracy in 1999, claiming that none of them benefitted either materially or otherwise.
