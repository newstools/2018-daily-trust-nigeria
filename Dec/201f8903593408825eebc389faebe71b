The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will regret nominating President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in office, the Chancellor of Hezekiah University, Umudi in Imo state Prof Daddy Hezekiah, has said. He said that, given the performance of the ruling party, the APC should have presented an alternative to Nigerians for the 2019 presidential election. The educationalist, who is also founder of Living Christ Mission Church, spoke to newsmen in Owerri on Saturday on the state of the nation. He said that the president had disappointed the citizens, stressing that Buhari had not done things to improve the economy and the country’s infrastructure. Hezekiah said “honestly, I don’t know why APC presented Buhari again. I am not for anybody or any political party, but I think that APC would have nominated another person for the office of the president. “Under Buhari, poverty, unemployment and killings increased. The dearth of infrastructure, especially lack of road is alarming. In seeking re-election the president must first present his scorecard to Nigerians”.
