The Chief Rabbi of Nigeria, Rabbi Israel Meyer Uzan, has said there is hope for Nigeria notwithstanding her many current challenges. He said this while speaking with Daily Trust at this year’s Jewish festival of Chanukah, organised by the CHABAD of Central Africa (COCA) and the Nigeria Jewish Community Centre (NJCC) in Abuja at the weekend. “Many people are losing hope, feeling that we are in darkness situation but this is not true,” he said. “In every situation, there is a solution.” “Even when we feel we are in a bad situation, we have to remember that small light can change a situation. The stronger the darkness, the more efficient the light. “Even if the darkness is strong today in Nigeria, don’t worry. Only a small light will lighten the country up. “Wherever you are, do something good and before you know it, it will spread and make the society a better place for all of us,” Uzan stressed. He said the Jewish festival of Chanukah is a symbol of triumph of light over darkness, the freedom of expression over tyranny and is the most popular celebration in Jewish culture. According to him, the celebration is to illustrate the message that a small light can dissolve much darkness and encourage people to appreciate others despite their differences. Speaking at the occasion, Nadav Goren, who spoke on behalf of the Israeli Embassy in Nigeria, said Israel will continue to cooperate with Nigeria in her quest to achieve greatness. He said the embassy had brought in experts from Israel to teach children with disabilities in Nigeria, adding that Isreal will continue to share her knowledge with Nigeria. “A candle for one is a candle for 100. When you share knowledge, it does not die, it continue spreading. We will continue to share knowledge in Nigeria,” he said.
