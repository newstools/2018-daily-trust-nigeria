President Muhammadu Buhari deserves commendation for not signing the NBC Amendment Bill 2018, Engineer Yusuf Kayode Ahmadu and Barbara Ekprikpo have said. The experts added that, “The president’s refusal to sign the bill was again communicated to the Senate President with reasons, which are mostly in alignment with the views of industry experts.” Speaking against the backdrop of allegations that that some insertions made into the bill were inimical to the position of the Government white paper on the NBC act, the experts said the president clearly stated that he was declining assent to the bill because he would require more appropriate approach and ensure that the NBC is not disempowered in the amended act. “In a bizarre show of lack of national  interest, some Nigerians colluded with their  foreign cohorts to influence the National Assembly to, not only insert some  strange clauses that would tamper with the number of Digital Broadcasting Signalling Distributor (BSD) Licenses, stipulated by the white paper, but also expunge the clause that empowers the NBC  to efficiently carry out its functions,” they said. They added that the ‘illegal’ action, if allowed to pass, would grossly hamper the ongoing Digital Switch Over (DSO) process.
