Gunmen have abducted three persons in Pegni village in Kuje Area Council of the FCT. A resident of Kuje, who identified himself as Dahiru, said the incident happened last Thursday night around 7:30pm. Dahiru gave the names of the victims as Mary Udoh Adaku, Mrs. Abiodun and Alhaji Rilwan, saying they were driving in separate vehicles but were abducted and taken into the bush at almost the same time. City News learnt that Mary Adaku, who is a staff of the National Assembly, was returning from work when she was abducted by the gunmen. City News reliably gathered that the kidnappers have demanded N15m ransom. The Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the Chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, said the council had been informed about the abductions. Alhaji Galadima expressed shock and sadness over the abductions, saying the chairman reached out to security agencies when he got news of the abductions. “The chairman has reached out to the police and they have entered the forest to ensure that the victims are rescued alive,” he said. When contacted, spokesman of the FCT Police Command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, said he was not aware of the abductions, but that he would reach out to the Kuje Police Division to find out and get back to our reporter.
