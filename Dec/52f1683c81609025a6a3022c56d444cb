Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello and the House of Assembly have sought for an out-of-court settlement in a suit instituted against them by the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Nasiru Ajanah and Chief Registrar, Yahaya Adamu. Ajanah and Adamu had approached the court last week in the wake of the purported plan by the assembly to investigate them and the state judiciary following a petition by Secretary to the State Government, Folashade Arike Ayoade, against the judiciary purporting an impasse between the executive and judiciary arms of the state. When the case came up yesterday, counsel to the defendants, Mr Rotimi Oguneso, announced his “personal conviction” that the nature of the matter was such that ought to be resolved out of court. He, therefore, applied for an adjournment to allow him explore the possibility of settlement out of court. Counsel to the plaintiffs, Adegboyega Awomolo, did not oppose the application. He, however, applied for extension of time of the lifespan of the earlier orders of the court to avoid embarrassment to the parties. In his ruling, Justice Alaba Omolaye-Ajileye noted that it was part of the duties of a court to encourage amicable settlement of matters out of court. He commended the initiative of Oguneso in seeking to get the matter resolved out of court. The judge, however, held that the fear expressed by Awomolo over the need to preserve the earlier orders of the court was well-founded. He adjourned the case to February 4, 2019.
