A Member of the House of Representatives from Jigawa State, Yuguda Hassan Kila, has denied being the target of an attack by thugs during a reconciliation meeting of some members of the APC on Saturday. The ‎meeting was called to reconcile aggrieved members of the party in Gwaram Local Government Area of the state, but thugs reportedly attacked some of the members that attended. The lawmaker, who represents Gwaram Federal Constituency, while reacting to a story by Daily Trust, in a statement yesterday, said he had long ‎left the venue of the meeting before the attack took place, and that hence he could not have been their target. “The thugs that attacked the political leaders after the meeting was successfully held were hired by some politicians who failed woefully in their bid to occupy political offices during the last APC primaries. I had long left the venue of the meeting when the attack took place, hence I could not have been the target of the hired thugs. “As representative of Gwaram Federal Constituency, I have been representing my people diligently in the past three and half years, which was why they found me worthy of contesting for a second term, and they voted me during the primaries,” he said.
