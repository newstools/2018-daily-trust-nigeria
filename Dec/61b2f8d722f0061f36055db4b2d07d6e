The national leadership of the APC should withdraw the ticket of any party leader backing candidates in other political parties for the 2019 election, the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has advised. The BMO gave the advice following moves by  Governors Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun) and Rocha Okorocha (Imo) to back their preferred governorship candidates contest on the platforms of other political parties next year. The group said in a statement signed by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary, Cassidy Madueke that such acts amounted to anti party activities that should not be encouraged. “We are disappointed that some ranking APC members who are actually founding members of the ruling party have encouraged some of their associates who lost out in the recent party primaries to seek elective offices on the platforms of other parties. “It is wrong for these party chieftains to publicly exhibit acts of disloyalty and still expect to be accorded respect and rewarded by the ruling party. If they feel their associates are good enough to contest on another platform, they should also go pick the tickets of those parties,” the group said.
