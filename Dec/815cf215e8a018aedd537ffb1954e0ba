The National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Olu Falae, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to tackle insecurity and promote unity among the nation’s various ethnic nationalities first rather than focusing on his re-election. Chief Falae, in his New Year greetings, said the strength of mutual understanding and co-existence that made Nigerians rise and live together in peace and unity had been eroded by misgovernance and lackadaisical attitude of past leaders towards addressing fundamental national questions. In a statement signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Alfa Mohammed, the SDP boss urged President Buhari to jettison his personal interest for the national and collective interest of Nigerians for the good of all. Falae, who regretted the killings of the Nigerian soldiers fighting insurgency in the North-East, implored Nigerians to pray fervently for the country against the looming anarchy. “As a party, we are saddened that our soldiers like our civilians compatriots are being decimated by what some people tagged ragtag Boko Haram insurgents and herdsmen. “All these we look forward to quick end. We call on the citizens to intensify prayers to God to guide those in power and imbue them with the capacity and wisdom to tackle the nation’s challenges and avert the looming anarchy,” he said. The SDP national chairman expressed optimism that the New Year would usher in the fulfilment of the aspirations of Nigerians, urging them to cast their votes for the right presidential candidate during the election.
