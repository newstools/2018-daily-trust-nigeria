Armed policemen, on Friday afternoon, stormed the Maitama residence of Senator Dino Melaye, seeking to arrest him. The policemen, who came in about five vehicles, arrived the residence at about 12:30 and later gained access into the senator’s house. The policemen used two of their vehicles to block the gate of the senator’s house, with some of the operatives outside. One of the policemen in mufti, who approached journalists, said they were there to arrest the Kogi senator. “We are here to arrest Dino,” the policeman said, but failed to respond when journalists sought to know why they wanted to arrest the senator. He simply told journalists to find out from the spokesman of the Nigeria Police Force, Jimoh Moshood. The policeman told journalists, especially cameramen, to stop recording them. Dino had, few days ago, alleged that the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, had plans to poison him to death.
