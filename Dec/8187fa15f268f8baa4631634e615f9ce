A healthy baby girl has been born using a womb transplanted from a dead body. The 10-hour transplant operation – and later fertility treatment – took place in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2016. The mother, 32, was born without a womb. There have been 39 womb transplants using a live donor, including mothers donating their womb to their daughter, resulting in 11 babies. But the 10 previous transplants from a dead donor have failed or resulted in miscarriage. In this case, the womb donor was a mother of three in her mid-40s who died from brain bleeding. The recipient had Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, which affects about one in every 4,500 women.
