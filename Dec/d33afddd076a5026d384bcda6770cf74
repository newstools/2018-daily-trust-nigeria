The Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria (MHWUN)  has called on President Muhammadu Buhari  to grant it audience inorder to tackle the professional rivalry and disharmony in the health sector. National president of the union, Comrade Josiah Biobelemoye made the call yesterday during the 40th anniversary celebration of the union in Abuja. The theme of the lecture was ‘Industrial Relations in Nigeria Today, Challenges and Prospects.’ He said that there must be justice and fairness in the health sector for it to enjoy peaceful industrial relations, adding that until the president gives audience to the health workers, he will never know the truth about happenings in the health sector. He said that President Muhammadu Buhari has given audience three times to the members of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), but failed to give even a single audience to other  health workers since he came to power over three years ago. “The president  gave audience three times since he came to power to less than  five percent of the people who work in the health sector but has not given audience to over 95 per cent of the workers in the health sector who have been agitating and calling on him for audience till date. When he does that, he will know the truth, and the truth shall set us free . The Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria (MHWUN) president also called on government to respect collective agreements with his group, adding “ until the bias stops, the health system cannot work well.
