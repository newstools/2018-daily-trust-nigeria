A Federal High Court in Birnin-Kebbi has remanded a former governor of the state, Usman Dakingari and two others; Sunday Dogoyaro and Garba Kamba, in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission pending the determination of their bail application on December 10. The trio are standing trial on 13-count charges against them by the EFCC over alleged conspiracy and money laundering. Justice  Bassey Onu ordered that they be remanded for allegedly receiving N450 million from the former Minister of Petroleum Resources,Deizani Alison-Madueke, contrary to  section 1A of money laundry Act 2015 punishable under section 16(2B among others. The lead counsel to the EFCC, J.A Ojogbane, in his submission, urged the court to take their pleas and the charges be read to them for immediate commencement of their trial. But the defendants pleaded not guilty to all the charges as the prosecutor’s leading counsel asked the court to commence their trial immediate.
