The youth leader of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the FCT, Comrade Zaka D. Sunday, has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of  allegedly impoverishing the masses instead of improving on their living standard. Sunday, who stated this at a summit/harmonization meeting of the coalition of the FCT PDP support groups in Abuja yesterday, accused the ruling APC of poor performance and lack of direction on the economy of the country. He stressed the need for the FCT PDP youth support groups across the six area councils to ensure they were counted among the patriots that would make the party come back to power at all levels in next year’s general elections. He said the summit was aimed at bringing together all the PDP youths across the FCT to brainstorm on how to get back the peoples’ mandate from the APC. “And it was on this note that I want to charge all of you here today to go back to your base, sensitise and mobilise the masses at the grassroots to vote for all PDP candidates in next year’s general elections,” he said He assured the  party’s youth group of providing the enabling environment for all the committed members in the course of their assignment, while advising them against using thugs during election campaign. Also speaking, Senator Philip Aduda, commended the FCT PDP youth leader and their executives for organizing the summit/harmonization meeting, saying the meeting was a clear sign that PDP’s victory in next year’s election was guranteed. He charged the various PDP youth groups at the meeting to ensure they remained united as they strategised towards ensuring the party’s victory at all levels.
