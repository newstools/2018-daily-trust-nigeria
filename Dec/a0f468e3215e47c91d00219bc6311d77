The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Mr. Bitrus Bako Nabasu, has stressed the need for Nigeria to be self-reliant by producing goods and services whose prices it can determine. Mr. Nabasu said this when he received a certificate of performance as an icon of diligent service and capacity building in the federal civil service by Vision 1youth Leadership Development Initiative in his office in Abuja. According to Mr. Nabasu, “The Ministry is focused on promoting self-reliance in Science, Technology and Innovation which is our constitutional function as spelt out in Section 18, Sub-section 2 whereby the Federal Government must promote Science, Technology and Innovation.” The Permanent Secretary highlighted the efforts the ministry is making to ensure that Nigeria’s economy bounces back to life, by ensuring the nation shifts from being a mono-economy based on resources to a diverse economy that is knowledge and innovation driven. Earlier, the Deputy Chief Executive of Vision 1 Leadership Development Initiative, Mr. Victor Nse-Abasi praised the Permanent Secretary in driving the ministry’s activities in line with the set-out objectives of the ministry.
