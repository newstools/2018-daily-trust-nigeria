The PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation (PPCO) has rejected the planned introduction of nationwide Military ‘Operation Python Dance’ ahead of the 2019 general elections, describing it as a ploy by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to use the military in rigging the elections. The Director Media and Publicity of the PPCO, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan claimed  in a statement yesterday that the main aim was to  unleash heavy security presence to intimidate, harass and instil fear in voters in PDP strongholds across the country and pave way for the “allocation of fictitious votes” to President Buhari and the APC. The PPCO which said the APC was afraid of losing the polls, added that information available to it showed that some bigwigs in the ruling party were already perfecting rigging plans with compromised staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). “Our investigation shows that part of the plot is to use the military operation as a subterfuge to unleash heavy security presence to intimidate, harass and instill fear in voters in PDP strongholds across the country and pave the way for the allocation of fictitious votes to President Buhari and the APC.
