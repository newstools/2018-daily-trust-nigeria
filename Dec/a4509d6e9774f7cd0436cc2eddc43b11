The Lagos State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Olawale Oluwo has resigned his appointment. In a copy of resignation letter sighted by Daily Trust in Lagos, the former Commissioner blamed the controversial gubernatorial primary of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) in the State as his reason of leaving the party. The primary had produced Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu as the party’s flagbearer as against his boss, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, who was seeking a second term ticket. In a twitter post that followed the resignation letter, the former Commissioner said he would be joining the campaign train of the gubernatorial candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Jimi Agbaje, his long- time friend. The twitter post read: “I, Olawale Oluwo, will be joining the PDP to work with my friend and brother – Mr. Jimi Agbaje in the struggle to #FreeLagos  #FreeLagosNow #iStandwithJimi.” Lagos 2019: I'm confident of defeating Ambode,Sanwo-Olu,Otedola — Jimi Agbaje In Lagos, Ambode, others walking a tight rope LAGOS 2019: Agbaje emerges PDP guber candidate
