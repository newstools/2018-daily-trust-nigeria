The gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) in Kano State, Malam Salihu Sagir Takai, has launched an online campaign website and social media team. Launching the website and social media team, yesterday, at Kano Press Centre, Takai said his gubernatorial candidature was for the people, adding that his challengers would face serious resistance from the electorate. Takai charged the social media team to only post genuine information. “We must lead by example. You should ensure that whatever you are posting on our site is genuine and nothing but the truth. We should not dent anybody’s image in the name of politics,” he warned. The PRP gubernatorial candidate said though he had left the PDP, his relationship with Malam Ibrahim Shekarau and other political bigwigs was still intact. Earlier, the state chairman of the PRP, Alhaji Sammani Bashir, said the social media was a powerful platform for campaign.
