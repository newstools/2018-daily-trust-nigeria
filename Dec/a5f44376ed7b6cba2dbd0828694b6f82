The APC National Vice Chairman, South-South, Ntufam Hilliard Etta, has cautioned the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Pastor Usani Usani, from parading himself as the governorship candidate of the party in Cross River State for 2019. Etta extended the same warning to all others equally parading themselves as candidates for other elective positions, emphasising that only the candidates duly endorsed by the national headquarters of the party were to stand in elections. He spoke in Calabar when the APC governorship candidate, Sen. John Owan-Enoh, commissioned his campaign office. He warned that the party would invoke relevant sections of the its constitution against them and hand them over to law enforcement agencies if they did not desist from the act of impersonation. He said the national reconciliation committee set up by the party would soon arrive the state for all aggrieved party members to resolve their problems. A former Senate Majority Leader, Victor Ndoma-Egba, said the APC was unstoppable at recovering the state.
