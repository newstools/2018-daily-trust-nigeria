All Progressives Congress (APC) members, supporters, bigwigs and enthusiasts from across the nine LGAs of Kogi East senatorial district gathered at the weekend in the ancient town of Anyigba, Dekina LGA for official flag off of campaign for the zone. Speaking during the event, Director General of the APC Presidential Campaign in Kogi State, Edward Onoja, urged the gathering and people of Kogi East district to vote massively for President Muhammadu Buhari as well as all candidates of the APC contesting for various elective positions in the 2019 election to enjoy more dividends of democracy. Onoja asked the people to be wiser and support a candidate like Buhari whom he noted runs a pro-masses government with several social interventions such as the N-Power, TraderMoni, MarketMoni, School Feeding, Conditional Cash Transfer, among other interventions aimed at assisting the poor across the country. He said, Governor Yahaya Bello APC-led administration in the state has brought tremendous infrastructural development to all parts of the state, particularly Igalaland. Also speaking, candidates of the party for National and State Assembly seats from the area all called on the electorate to give the party maximum support and promised not to disappoint them if given the mandate.
