Femi Adesina, special adviser on media to the President, has issued a statement saying businessman Aliko Dangote is not a member of the campaign council of the All Progressive’s Congress. It came after reports previously named Dangote, alongside Femi Otedola, Bola Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, as being on the council. But Adesina spoke of need to “further clarify the status” of Dangote. “Africa’s richest man, not being a card-carrying member of APC, cannot, and is not member of the [campaign council,” said Adesina. “He is also a member of the Peace Committee, and thus cannot be in a partisan campaign council.” Dangote not member of Buhari campaign council – Presidency UPDATED: APC appoints Dangote, Otedola members of Buhari's campaign committee Tinubu, Dangote, Otedola make Buhari’s campaign council
