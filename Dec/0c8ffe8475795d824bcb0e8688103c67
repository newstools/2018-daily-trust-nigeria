The group explained that musicians that would participate tomorrow at the concert, scheduled to take place at Filin Sukuwa, included Mudassir Kasim, Tagwayen Asali, Sa’eed Nagudu, Rabi’u Dalle and Maryam Fantimoti among others. It added that the aim of the concert was to create awareness on the negative consequences of vote buying and to reduce corrupt practices in electioneering processes. He said: “The practice of vote buying and selling dates back to the history of Nigeria’s politics but became more prevalent in recent years. “The electorates, without thinking of consequences, sell out their mandate to the highest bidder who after winning the election, never surface not to talk of delivering his/her campaign promises.” Vote buying casts dark clouds over 2019 elections 2019: Why vote-buying will make youth lose faith in education Group launches ‘Not Too Young To Run’ movement in Gombe
