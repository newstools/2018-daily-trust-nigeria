An Islamic scholar, Ustaz Ismail Abdulaziz, has advised teenagers to guide against the temptation of searching for wealth through unlawful means because of desperation to live an ostentatious lifestyle. Ustaz Abduaziz spoke yesterday in Abuja at the formal opening ceremony of a five-day Holiday Training Course (HTC) organised by the FCT chapter of the Organization of Tadhamunul Muslimeen (OTM) in collaboration with The Triumph-Treasure Future Scholars (TFS) and Young Leaders’ Circle (YLC). He said the quest for wealth must be in line with Allah’s injunctions, adding that human needs should be controlled by Islamic rules and regulations. The cleric, who urged the teenagers to ensure that their needs were always controlled by divine manual of Allah and the tradition of Prophet Muhammad (SAW), underscored the need to nurture souls with dhikr (remembrance of Allah). “When we abandon what the soul needs and focus on physical needs, we begin to face various problems in the society. Allah has given us Qur’an and sunnah which should be our divine manual,” said Abdulaziz. He advised the youths to live a productive and Godly youthful life as the stage could either make or mar their dreams and ambitions. The Ameer of Abuja Muslim Forum (AMF), Barr. Lukman Ahmad, who spoke at the occasion, told the delegates that they could become professors, medical doctors, engineers, and bankers among other leading professionals if they strictly followed the right counselling of Islam. Barr. Ahmad, who urged them to implement what they taught during the course, also enjoined to be beneficial to others in the society. Prof. Abdulwasii Gabadeen, in his counsel, implored the delegates, to the biography of their role models, his virtues and emulate those virtuous ideals. The holiday training course with over 400 delegates ends tomorrow.
