The Bank of Industry (BoI), Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN) and the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) are among corporate giants that have shown interest in participating in the second Northern Nigeria Solid Minerals Fair and workshop holding from December 13 to 15 at the Legbo Kutigi International Conference Centre in Minna, Niger State. In a statement, the organisers said the specialised trade fair would now hold yearly following the success of the maiden edition held in May, 2017, at the Kaduna International Trade Fair Ground. The theme of this year’s expo is: “The Mines and Mineral Sector as a Key Player in Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.”  It is jointly organised by the Niger State Government, the Niger Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture and Proedge Communication. The Consultant of the project, Mr. Tajudeen Abdulkareem, said, “In the last three years, the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, has rolled out several regulatory frameworks and investment-friendly policies. It is imperative that states and local governments pick up the gauntlet, exploring avenues to create jobs and enhance wealth through the creation of special purpose vehicles or engage in joint ventures in exploiting the vast mineral deposits in their domain.” Dangote to up investments in Niger FG inaugurates committee for OIC trade fair in Kuwait FG inaugurates committee for OIC trade fair in Kuwait
