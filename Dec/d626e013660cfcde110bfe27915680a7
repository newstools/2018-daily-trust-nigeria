France’s President Emmanuel Macron has said he deeply regrets President Donald Trump’s controversial decision to withdrawal all US troops from Syria. “An ally must be dependable,” said Mr Macron, who reportedly called Mr Trump to warn him against the plan. The US said the Islamic State (IS) group had been defeated, a claim disputed by allies and US politicians. France, a key part of the US-led coalition against IS in Syria and Iraq, said its troops would remain in Syria. Speaking on a visit to French troops in Chad, Mr Macron said: “To be allies is to fight shoulder to shoulder. It’s the most important thing for a head of state and head of the military.” He also stressed the importance of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters credited with playing a major role in the virtual elimination of IS after it overran large swathes of Syria four years ago.
