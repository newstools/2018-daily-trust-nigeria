India opened its longest road-rail bridge in the northeastern state of Assam on Tuesday as part of efforts to boost defences on its sensitive border with China. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi drove an inaugural cavalcade along the 4.9km Bogibeel bridge over the Brahmaputra river to inaugurate the project which has taken nearly two decades and $800m to complete. The bridge, near the city of Dibrugarh, will enable the military to speed up the dispatch of forces to neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China.
