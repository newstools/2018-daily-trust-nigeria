Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that no single person can make an Igbo man President of Nigeria rather a Nigerian President of Igbo origin could only be produced by Nigerians themselves. Obasanjo spoke at the country-home of first Republic Nigerian Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazulike Amechi, in Ukpor Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State, where he was invited to unveil the life-size statue of the former minister erected by the Ukpor people to appreciate his contribution to the growth of the area. Chief Obasanjo said that God in his infinite wisdom and mercy had not given any person such power to produce such President of Igbo nativity and advised the people not to be deceived by anybody. He said, “It is Nigerians; not one individual that can make an Igbo man the president of Nigeria. And is only when Nigerians believe, and you should make them believe that the Igbos are part and parcel of this Obodo, Nigeria. “For anybody to say when I leave this place, I will hand it over to the Igbo; it’s a lie. God hasn’t given anybody that power. “And if any Igbo man or woman believes that; I don’t know what to call it. But if we will get there, we have to work together as a team.” Obasanjo also said, “The major tribe in the East is the Igbo, and they must have opportunity; whether they will do it well or not well; let them have the opportunity.” Obasanjo: No one individual can make Igbo Nigerian President South-east’s quest for power shift Page 20 Analysis
