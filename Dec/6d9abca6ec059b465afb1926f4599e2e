Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has expressed deep grief over the passing on of the Second Republic President, Alhaji Shehu Shagari. Ekweremadu described the death as “a heavy loss to the nation” noting that the late politician was a “sage, democrat, and statesman.” Writing on his Twitter handle @iamekweremadu, the Senator said: “I received with a heavy heart the news of the passing on the Second Republic President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Alhaji Shehu Shagari. “He was a democrat by nature, orientation, and conviction. He was a patriot per excellence, a detribalised elder statesman, bridge-builder, servant-leader, and an epitome of humility, who served the nation and humanity most creditably. In and out of office, Alhaji Shagari clothed the office of the president with decorum and social grace,” Senator Ekweremadu said.
