The Chairman of Kuje Area Council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has denied spending N1.6 billion on capital projects since he assumed office. Alhaji Galadima, who spoke through his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Haruna Usman, while reacting to a media report yesterday, said the council inherited liabilities of N1.6bn. Galadima said there was no time he mentioned that the projects executed by his administration within the two and half years gulped up to N1.6bn, addind that the liabilities incurred included unpaid contracts and 48 court litigations. “And it was as a result of the court litigations that court garnished the account of the area council. But it amazed me to read on the media that the council spent N1.6bn on capital projects; which is not so,” he said. He further said the council had been able to clear six months salary arrears, adding that the council was also able to clear 75 per cent of the debt owed some contractors after it persuaded them to withdraw their cases from courts. The chairman added that despite the challenges of paucity of funds, the administration had been able to tackle some challenges, especially the problem of water across various communities.
