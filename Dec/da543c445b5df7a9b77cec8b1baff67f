A former Bauchi State governor, Ahmed Adamu Mu’azu has came back to Bauchi after three years absence. Mu’azu arrived the country midweek for his daughter’s wedding which took place in Bauchi on Saturday (today). The ceremony was attended by his friends, political and business associates including national and state PDP bigwigs. He was believed to have stayed in Abuja ‎for some days and then went to Bauchi within the week for the wedding. The former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)‎ chairman had not been in the country for three years since the party lost the 2015 general elections. Dubbed as the ‘Game Changer’ Mu’azu was the PDP chairman when the then President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan lost to president Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC). His absence, many believed, was as a result of the defeat suffered by the PDP while he was at the helm of affairs‎.
