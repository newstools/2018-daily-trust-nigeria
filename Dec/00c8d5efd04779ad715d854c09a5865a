The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has claimed that the rehashing of old policies is the reason the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and its predecessor, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) failed Nigeria. The vice-presidential candidate of APGA, Jerry Chukwueke, made this claim at a briefing on the party’s next line of action following its exclusion from the just concluded vice presidential debate for the 2019 general elections. He said the two parties presented old figures and a policy without being courageous enough to address the fundamental problem affecting the country, which he noted was the structure of the country. “The one party left office after 16 years, the other has been in office for four years. Nothing changed; in fact, things are much worse,” he said. On insecurity, Chukwueke said: “We all know what is happening with security in Nigeria at the moment. First, we are facing insurgency as an existential threat and then we are also facing poverty as another existential threat.” He said the party planned to use military contractors to root out Boko Haram from the North East and restore the country’s security because the gallant members of the armed forces were ill-equipped and ill-motivated to confront the terrorists. “If we invest in military contractors now, they will come with their equipment ready to go,” he said. He said the party’s presidential candidate, retired General John Gbor, planned to adopt restructuring, and engender equity and justice as a means of addressing the causes of insecurity in the country. 2015: APC’ll defeat PDP - Sen  Okonkwo 2015: APGA: The making of ‘third leg of the tripod’ 2015: As ‘small’ parties prepare to field presidential candidates
