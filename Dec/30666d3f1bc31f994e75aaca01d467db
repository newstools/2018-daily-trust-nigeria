The Kwara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has cancelled its gubernatorial campaign flag off earlier slated to hold yesterday at Kosubosu, headquarters of Baruteen Local Government Area of the state over security issue. A statement from the APC governortorial candidate, Abdulrahman Abdulrazak, said the party got reports that some persons had been imported from neighbouring Benin Republic to lay ambush on roads leading to the venue of the campaign. According to Abdulrazak, “Some of our members who had taken off early in the morning escaped being attacked only by the grace of God. The situation around Chikanda town is not favourable at all. “Therefore, I have reached out to relevant security agencies on how to arrest the ugly situation. It is no news that some reactionary forces are no longer at ease since we debut our campaign slogan – ‘O to ge’. Their reactions have shown that they will resist every attempt to change the old order in Kwara State,” he said.
