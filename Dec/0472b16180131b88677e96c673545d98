Former military President, General Ibrahim Babaginda, has said the demise of former civilian president, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, was a loss not only to Nigeria but Africa at large. In a condolence message on Friday, he said the former president died at a time Nigeria and Africa needed his wise counsel most. Babangida stated that President Shagari was a great patriotic leader and an accomplished gentleman, who was first a teacher, an administrator, a technocrat and an honest decent unassuming simple Nigerian leader. According to him, the late former leader would be remembered for his tolerance and politics of peace without bitterness. “To keep his memory alive, Nigerian politicians and indeed all fellow Nigerians must put to practice all his ideals of peace and party politics without rancour, irrespective of any form of provocation.” He prayed for the repose of the soul of the late leader in Paradise.
