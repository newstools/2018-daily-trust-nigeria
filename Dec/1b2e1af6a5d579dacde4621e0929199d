The Kwara State APC governorship candidate, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has rejected suggestion by the state government that his campaign slogan, Otoge (enough is enough), could spark political unrest or suspicion. AbdulRazaq, who reacted in a statement yesterday, said that the campaign slogan was properly vetted and approved by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) which he insisted was the only statutory and non-partisan body that should do so. He said the government was only jittery and trying to crack down on the opposition as “Otoge slogan simply means that our people have had enough and are desirous of change through the ballot box.”
