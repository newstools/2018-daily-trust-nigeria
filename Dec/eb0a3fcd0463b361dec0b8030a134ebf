The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Osun State, Ademola Adeleke, has been re-arraigned before a Federal High Court in Abuja over alleged examination malpractice. Adeleke on Tuesday took fresh plea alongside four others in a seven-count charge for personation and registering as internal students of Ojo-Aro Community Grammar School, Ojo-Aro Osun State to enable him to sit for the National Examination Council (NECO) examination of June/July 2017. According to the Nigerian Police, the offences contravene Section 10 of the Examination Malpractices Act Cap E15 LFN 2004. The others are the senator’s relative, Sikiru Adeleke; the principal of the school, Aregbosola Mufutau; the registrar of the school, Gbadamosin Thomas Ojo; and a teacher in the school, Dare Samuel Olutope. Following the plea of not guilty by all the defendants, Justice Edward Ekwo granted the lawmaker bail on self-recognition. The judge ordered that he is, however, to deposit his international passport with the court registrar, while he can only travel out of the country on the court’s approval. The judge directed Senator Adeleke to sign a bond guaranteeing that he will attend the trial will end. However, Senator Adeleke through his counsel, Alex Izinyon (SAN) applied for the release of his international passport to enable him to travel abroad for a medical check. Justice Ekwo granted the application but directed that he must return the passport to the court immediately he returns to the country. The case was adjourned to February 12, 2019, for trial.
