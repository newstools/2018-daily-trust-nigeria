A 16-year-old secondary school student in Ado Grammar School, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, Mathew Favour, has been hacked to death by another student, Kehinde Timilehin, using a machete within school premises. Favour, who was in Senior Secondary II, was said to be contesting the efficacy of a charm with the suspect on who actually had superior power, during which he was stabbed in the chest and later died at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital(EKSUTH), Ado Ekiti. Sources told our correspondent on Friday that Favour, who was from Kogi State, actually brought the ‘juju’ weapons to school but was killed after the axe and knife wrapped with white and red scarf could not pierce the suspect who overpowered him and stabbed him in “self-defence.” The school has now been taken over and barricaded by police, to forestall a possible reprisal attack emanating from a threat issued by the deceased’s family. Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu said he has not been officially briefed about the killing.  16-yr-old student dies in ‘juju’ superiority contest in Ekiti Police in Ekiti confirm arrest of alleged killer of monarch When teachers prey on their students
