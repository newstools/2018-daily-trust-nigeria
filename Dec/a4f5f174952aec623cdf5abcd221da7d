Orphans at the Christ Foundation Orphanage in Kuje, Abuja, are appealing to government for scholarships to enable them further their education. Two teenagers from the orphanage who spoke to Daily Trust  said they wanted government and people of good will to assist the orphanage and support their education. Monday Shehu said he was brought to the orphanage when he was nine years old and now in Senior Secondary Class 2 (SS2), at the government secondary school Kuje. He said he wants to be an accountant, but needs help to get quality education to enable him achieve his dream. The founder of the orphanage, Patrica Kuta, said she started the orphanage 14 years ago and has been self sustaining. She said with 45 orphans in school from nursery to university, the orphanage is in need of assistance to cater for their school fees. She also said government can provide special scholarships for such orphans and also jobs when they finish school as well as vocational training. She spoke when the orphanage received food and school material from the wife of the National Security Adviser (NSA) Mohammed Monguno, Hajiya Nafisah Munir-Monguno on Thursday in Kuje. Nafisah Munir-Mongono who was represented by her sister, Hajiya Fareedah Munir, said the items were given to the orphanage to encourage women like Patrica Kuta who is taking care of the children without assistance from government. She noted that Monguno’s charity Precious Little Live Initiative assists orphanages with food stuff, school learning materials, books, school bags, and cloth material among others.
