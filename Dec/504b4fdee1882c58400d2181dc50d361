Chief Nathaniel Odebunmi, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Egbeda Local Government Area of Oyo State, says only corrupt Nigerians are afraid of the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari. Odebunmi, who stated this on Monday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, (NAN) in Ibadan, urged Nigerians to support the re-election of the president so as to end corruption in the country. According to him, the Buhari administration has done well in the fight against corruption as well as improved security and the economy. ”The effect of the corruption war is biting harder on the beneficiaries of the scourge and that is the reason they are against the re-election of the president. ”Every Nigerian that wants the development of the country should support the re-election of Buhari. ”We should not allow those that ruined the nation’s economy through embezzlement of the national wealth to come back. ” Nigerians should not be deceived by propaganda and false publications against Buhari’s administration but focus on the achievements, ” he said. Odebunmi assured the people of Oyo state that an APC government would continue to cater for their well-being if returned to power in 2019. He urged the electorate to guard their Permanent Voter Cards and shun the temptation of selling their votes during the elections.
