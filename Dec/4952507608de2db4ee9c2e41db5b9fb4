Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong has said the overwhelming support of the electorates in Plateau State was an indication that the All Progressive Congress (APC) will deliver the State to President Muhammadu Buhari. Lalong said to a large crowd of supporters yesterday evening at the commissioning of his campaign office in Jos, that, “seeing this large crowd today means everything has been made easy because we are only waiting to swear in the president because APC is deeply rooted in Plateau State.” He said all the governors, including those under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, had visited the president on Friday and said he was surprised when irrespective of party affiliations, all praised the president for rescuing the country. The governor said his campaign office will serve not only him but President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that “every governor is charged with the responsibility of not just delivering himself and every contestant in the party but also of delivering Mr. President.” “By the time we flag off the campaign, I don’t know if the new stadium will take us because even before the flag off, the list of people I have that want to move to the APC is so heavy that I don’t think the party chairman will be able to hold it, we may have to call the National Party chairman to assist him. Earlier, the State APC Chairman, Lateb Dabang said all commissioners and government aides should be ready to relocate to the grassroots to campaign for the party. on his part, the Lalong/Tyoden Campaign Director General, Arch. Pam Dung Gyang said the leadership style of the governor had rescued the state, adding that, “we now have a Plateau for all because no tribe or religion is being oppressed.”
