The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen has charged judges to cut off unnecessary friends that may bring problems to the courts as the country enters the 2019 election season. Onnoghen gave this charge on Friday after receiving the award of the Grand Patron of the National Association of Women Judges of Nigeria (NAWJN) at the opening ceremony of the association’s 2018 Biennial Conference in Abuja. The CJN said with elections around the corner, judges in the country must be steadfast and be guided by the Constitution and laws of the land, adding that they should “call a spade, a spade and the heavens will not fall.” Speaking on the theme of the conference, “Life after the bench: The judge emeritus”, the CJN admonished the women judges to embrace their inevitable futures with courage and not fear. The President of NAWJN, Justice Uwani Musa Abba Aji of the Court of Appeal, in her welcome address said the theme of the conference was selected because of certainty of retirement and to best prepare women judges for life after the bench.
