The Lagos State governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, says certain skills he described as “innovative” which his administration has been deploying in governance will still be useful to the state for the next 50 years, and even beyond. Ambode disclosed this yesterday at the “Fundamental Elements for Strategic Planning and Innovation in the Lagos State Public Service” workshop that the State Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions hosted in Lagos. To Ambode, the drive towards making Lagos a smart city must be anchored on the creativities of the government, its workforce and the people, adding it was this philosophy that informed his administration’s investment in the training and re-training of civil servants to enable them fit into the challenges and dynamism of modern society. “The landmass of Lagos is not expanding. But the population upsurge has been continuous.  The drivers of Lagos must be creative, and that is why we are channelling efforts at making Lagos a Smart City. “A Smart City is the one where everything works. And it is the reason our administration has been investing on training and retraining of staff, because to deliver innovations, we must have plans and in deploying those plans, we must be strategic,” Ambode, who was represented  by the Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Dr Akintola Benson-Oke, said. The governor urged civil servants to embrace new ways of doing things to secure better results. “The Lagos State Public Service will benefit from a healthy dose of ingrained innovativeness and strategic planning if it embraces innovation,” he said.
