A faith-based group, Al-Habibiya Islamic Society, has organised what it called ‘World Anti-Corruption Campaign for Youths’, in Gwagwalada. The campaign with theme ‘Faith Preaches Accountability and Good Governance’, was held at the Mini Campus of the University of Abuja, Gwagwalada. The Executive Director of Al-Habibiyya, Imam Ademola Adeyemi Fuad, said the essence of organising the anti-corruption campaign for youth was to sensitise them and share information about the dangers of corruption. Imam Fuad, who noted that the event coincided with the International Day for Anti-Corruption, said that prompted him to bring the youth together to create awareness among them on the impact of corruption. He said the campaign would go a long way in proffering solution to corruption, and that it was on that premise that it focused more on the youth who were leaders of tomorrow. The Project Coordinator of Al- Habibiyya, Dr. Rekiya Momoh Abaji, said the campaign was part of an ongoing project to sensitise people on the evils of corruption. Dr. Abaji said, “We are also members of the society and we have seen some negative things happening in the society and we thought that if we address the youth, they are in a position to carry forward the message of anti-corruption to the public.” Islamic academy introduces anti-corruption into courses Lagos to place Imams, Pastors on salaries for social reorientation Anti-corruption: Foundation trains Islamic scholars
