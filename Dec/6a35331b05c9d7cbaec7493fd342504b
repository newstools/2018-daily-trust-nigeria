The Minister of Communications, Barrister Adebayo Shittu, says he will be a bastard to support the APC governorship candidate in Oyo State, Chief Adebayo Adelabu. Shittu said he was defrauded out of the primary election and therefore said he would not support the person that got the ticket. Shittu, who fielded questions from journalists, yesterday, in Abuja said there could be no peace in the Pace Setter State without restitution and justice. The minister was edged out of the contest during screening for not participating in the mandatory NYSC scheme after leaving the university. When asked whether he would support the preferred candidate of Governor Abiola Ajimobi in 2019, the minister said, “I think it doesn’t arise. I will be a bastard to be defrauded out of a primary process and to simply behave like a slave! It won’t make sense. “I have been a foundation member of APC and I have twice aspired to be governor. In 2011, I aspired and I was defeated by the incumbent. In 2015, I aspired I was defrauded from the primary at that time and I challenged that process which produced Governor Ajimobi who won for a second term. I went to court; we were still in court when my appointment was announced. That made me to abandon that case and the governor, instead of him to thank his God that he was relieved of the case, started a campaign against my confirmation by the Senate,” he said.
