The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) has alleged that INEC and the presidency are planning to rig the 2019 general elections by creating illegal polling centres in Chad and Niger Republic. The Director Media and Publicity of   PPCO, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement yesterday, said the “plot” to secretly create polling centres outside the shores of Nigeria was in total violation of the 1999 Constitution. “President Buhari, INEC and all Nigerians know that there are no provisions for Diaspora voting under our system. By the extant laws guiding elections in Nigeria, it is very clear who is eligible to vote, as well as the centres statutorily designated for elections. There is no provision for any special arrangement whatsoever,” he said. “It is therefore reprehensible that President Buhari, in his desperation to rig the elections, is now trying to hide under the guise of making special provision for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) outside the country, to illegally create rigging centres outside our country and import contrived figures into the election results. “This clandestine arrangement further validates the alarm earlier raised by the PDP, in April this year, of INEC’s plot to secretly create 30,000 illegal polling centres in some remote areas, through which they plan to allocate millions of votes to President Buhari and the APC,” he added.
