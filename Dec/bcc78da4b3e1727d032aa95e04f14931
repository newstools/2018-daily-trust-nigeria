The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, has ordered a full-scale investigation into a case of alleged torture of a human rights activist who had gone to a police station to seek the bail of a detainee. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, who disclosed this yesterday, said that Edgal had expressed concern over the alleged torture and vowed that any policeman indicted after the investigation would not go unpunished. The activist, Sunday Oladipupo, had written a petition to the Commissioner of Police alleging unlawful detention, torture and arraignment by policemen at the Gbagada police division in Lagos when he made efforts to free from police detention one Samuel Oyekanmi, who Oladipupo maintained was a victim of extortion. Oyekanmi, who the police had arraigned on a six- count charge, claimed that the policemen framed him on leadership of the Eiye Confraternity. In his petition, Oladipupo asked for proper investigation of the case with a view to bringing the errant police officers to book. “The CP has directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department to withdraw the case from the court for reinvestigation. “The CP further directed the Deputy Commissioner to constitute an investigative panel and invite all the parties involved in the matter, including the police officer that initially handled the case, for thorough enquiries. “The Command frowns on any act of rights abuse against anybody, irrespective of their class or background. In its usual way, the Command assures members of the public that the outcome of the investigation would be made known,” Oti said.
