The governorship candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Niger State, Dr. Mani Ibrahim, has called on the electorate to be wary of “accidental” leaders who are bereft of ideas to handle the challenges of governance. Dr. Ibrahim made the call during the inauguration of the party’s campaign council ahead of the 2019 elections. Addressing party stakeholders and supporters, Dr. Ibrahim said there were a lot of people in leadership positions today but they could not deliver, saying they lacked leadership credentials. He said such individuals do not have what it took to lead the people aright and would always have ready excuses for their failures. “The era of accidental leadership must be over. People who become leaders by accident cannot be leaders. All the people that are not ready for leadership, that have no training, have no experience and no education; people that do not even know what they are doing cannot continue to be our leaders,” he said. He decried the state of helplessness in Niger State, saying the people had been neglected and were not feeling the impact of government. “People in Niger are tired of their current state of living, they want a different trend of governance and ADC has the alternative,” he said. Also speaking at the occasion, the National Secretary of ADC, Alhaji Saidu Baba, urged the campaign council to embark on door-to-door campaign to educate the people on what they stood to gain if the party was voted into power.
