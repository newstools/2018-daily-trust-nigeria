A 27-year-old armed robbery suspect, Godson Mbanugo, arrested by a police team attached to the Ajangbadi Division, Lagos, has said that hunger forced him into crime. Mbanugo, who is being detained at the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) office in Ikeja, was arrested on Monday while he and his accomplices were allegedly robbing residents of a house on Opaleye Street, Shibiri, on the Lagos suburb. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, told the Daily Trust yesterday that the suspect was arrested at the scene of the crime after some residents had raised a robbery alarm and policemen from the Ajangbadi Division and FSARS swiftly mobilized to the scene and arrested one of the robbers. Edgal said that when policemen searched Mbanugo on the spot, they found on him a cut-to- size double-barrel gun with seven live ammunitions and one expended cartridge. “During interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime. Investigation is ongoing with a view to arresting other members of the gang for prosecution,” he said.
