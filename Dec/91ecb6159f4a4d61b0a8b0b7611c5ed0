The Senate President, Bukola Saraki, yesterday, urged his supporters in Kwara State not to be afraid of federal might during the 2019 general elections. Saraki, who is a national leader of the PDP, said the party would not only sweep the elections in Kwara State, but would win the presidential election by the grace of God. He said the PDP leaders in the state had all what it took to win next year’s general elections. He pointed out that he had confronted such situation in two previous elections and floored the incumbents. Saraki spoke at the inauguration of a 42-man campaign council for the state PDP at the ABS Constituency Office, Ilorin, the state capital. The senate president said while the 2019 elections, like other elections, had its challenges, and that experience had shown that with the right tactics and strategies, the PDP would win the state again. “Don’t be afraid, don’t create fear in your hearts, I have heard all the talk of the opposition about using federal might.  But we have seen it all. We saw it in 2003, we saw it in 2015, or don’t you know that they used federal might in 2015? In 2015, with federal might, we defeated them. It was you people that God used then, and in 2019, with those who have come to join us, we will defeat them again.” He charged members of the campaign council to demonstrate utmost faithfulness in the discharge of their duties to achieve the desired results. Saraki pleaded with the aggrieved PDP members to sheath their swords and work for the party’s victory, promising that there would be a better deal for Nigerians under a government run by Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate. The Chairman of the campaign council, Prof. Suleiman Abubakar, in his acceptance speech, described the appointment as a call to service at a critical period in the history of the state and promised to give all it took to ensure success for the endeavour.
