The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has appealed to the United Nations Special Rapporteurs to prevail upon the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to reach an agreement with the striking Academic Staff Union of Universities. In the appeal dated December 28, 2018 and signed by SERAP Senior Legal Adviser Bamisope Adeyanju, the organization said by failing to prevent and end the ASUU strike, the Federal Government had defied and breached the explicit requirements of the right to equal access to higher education by Nigerian children and young people. SERAP stated: “The failure to end the ongoing strike action by ASUU is also a fundamental breach of the right to higher education without discrimination or exclusion, as strike actions continue to penalise economically disadvantaged parents who have no means or lack the capacity to pay to send their children to private schools. “The obligations of the Nigerian government to create the conditions necessary for the enjoyment of the right to education include to take preventive measures to address the root causes of strike action by ASUU and to take steps to end any strike action in a timely manner when it occurs.”  SERAP drags FG to United Nations over ASUU strike Thoughts on ASUU strike Group reports FG to UN over ASUU strike
