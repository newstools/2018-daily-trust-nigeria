Globacom has urged Christians to use the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ as espoused in Christmas to pray for peace, unity and love for the country. In a goodwill message issued to felicitate with Nigerian Christians, the company noted that with the nation preparing for general elections early next year, “no time is more auspicious than now to seek and pray for peace, unity and love for one another, because these are the virtues  Christ symbolised”. “As our brothers and sisters in the Christian faith celebrate Christmas, we rejoice with them and appeal to them to use the occasion of the celebration to seek the face of the Lord and pray for continued peaceful co-existence among the different groups in the country. If all Nigerians imbibe the virtues of Jesus Christ and demonstrate these in their lifestyle, the nation will remain united and make more progress, the statement added. Globacom, while suing for caution and moderation as Christians celebrate, noted that all Nigerians have roles to play in ensuring that there is safety of lives and property before, during and after the festivities. It urged road users during the season to be more circumspect.
