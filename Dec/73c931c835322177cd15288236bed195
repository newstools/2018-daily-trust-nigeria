Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will not lead the Conservative Party into the next general election. She said the party would prefer to “to go into that election with another leader”, as she arrived in Brussels for an EU summit. It confirms what she told MPs ahead of a confidence vote triggered by MPs angry at her Brexit policy. Mrs May won the vote but has vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her. The next scheduled general election is in 2022. Mrs May said: “I’ve said that in my heart I would love to be able to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election but I think it is right that the party feels that they would prefer to go into that election with another leader.”
