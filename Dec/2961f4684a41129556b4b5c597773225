The gubernatorial candidate of the Advanced Congress of Democrats (ADC) in Kano State, Alhaji Ahmad Bello, yesterday, said defeating Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje will not be a difficult task for his party in 2019. Speaking with newsmen in Kano, Bello said all indications had shown that his party was coasting home to victory. He said the party would take advantage of the series of Ganduje’s failed promises and ACD’s resolve to squarely face the state’s economic and social problems to win the state.
