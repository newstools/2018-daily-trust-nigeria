Israeli police have recommended indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara for alleged fraud and bribery. They are suspected of awarding regulatory favours to the Bezeq telecom firm in return for positive media coverage of the couple. Mr Netanyahu rejected the allegations in what is known as Case 4000. The Israeli attorney-general will now have to decide whether to bring charges in the case. In February, police recommended indicting Mr Netanyahu in two other corruption investigations. On Sunday, the Israeli police and the Israel Securities Authorities said there was sufficient evidence for bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust charges to be brought against Mr Netanyahu and his wife.
