The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) has condemned Monday’s raid on the residence of the sons of the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The PPCO in  a statement by its Director of Media and Publicity, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan on Monday also described the invasion as  vicious, outrageous, reprehensible and dirty politics allegedly being played by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) led government. The PPCO said President Buhari should note that, as an opposition presidential candidate from 2003 to 2015, none of his children or family members were in anyway attacked or victimized by the government in power, adding he should “stop importing such vicious underhand tactics” into the nation’s political space. “The invasion of Aliyu and Mustapha Abubakar’s home, even in their absence, allegedly in search of imaginary cache of foreign currency, has further exposed how depraved the Buhari Presidency has descended in the desperate plot to harm, traumatize and malign the character of our presidential candidate and his family, having realized that Nigerians have aligned behind him as the next President of our country. “It is indeed appalling that the Buhari Presidency can now go as low as engaging in wicked politics of chasing after family members of a presidential candidate, who are neither government officials, government contractors nor involved in any underhand dealings, but young students pursuing their legitimate personal educational careers without ill will to anybody. “While nothing incriminating was found in the apartment, the PPCO has been made aware of how the squad, said to be acting on ‘orders from above’ ransacked the house and destroyed valuables belonging to Atiku’s children and we demand an explanation from the leadership of the EFCC. “The PPCO completely rejects the wicked politics that the APC and the Buhari Presidency are importing into our polity. We hereby urge all Nigerians, particularly the youths, to rise in condemnation of these vicious acts,” the party said.
