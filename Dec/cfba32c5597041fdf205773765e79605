The Chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Prof. James Momoh, has registered displeasure at heads of the Distribution Companies (DisCos) for their slow and poor process of engaging Meter Assets Providers (MAPs) despite rising agitations by electricity users to be metered amid complaints of high estimated billings. Speaking on Tuesday at a MAP conference in Lagos organised by NERC, Prof. Momoh said despite the urgent nature of closing the metering gaps and calming agitations on over-estimated power bills, some DisCos were still “taking it as something for play.” MAP regulations became effective on April 3, 2018, from when the DisCos were to procure and engage MAP firms that obtained “No Objection” certificates from NERC in 120 days. NERC, in July, extended it by 90 days, elapsing in November, but with no visible customer metering so far. Prof. Momoh was displeased over the absence of nine of the 11 DisCos’ managing directors at the conference which had the full NERC commissioners in attendance and the prospective MAPs. The Managing Director of Benin DisCo, Funke Osibodu, and her counterpart at Yola DisCo, Mustapha Baba Umara, gave updates on procuring the MAP contracts. However, no DisCo reported going beyond evaluation stage to deploying meters to their customers. Momoh, who reacted to the poor reports, said, “Let your CEO know that what we have heard is not acceptable from some of you. “Next time we invite them, we need to get an exception note on why they should not be there,” he warned. Speaking in an interview with Daily Trust on the sidelines, the NERC head said the MAP implementation might not be visible by January, 2019, but that government would press hard on the DisCos through MAP to close the metering gaps by 2020. One of the prospective MAPs Executive, Odion Omonfoman, of New Hampshire Capital, said some DisCos demanded that MAPs provided power and arrested culprits of energy theft; which was outside the regulation’s framework, so he called on NERC to intervene. NERC Commissioner, Legal, Licensing and Compliance, Dafe Akpeneye, blamed DisCos for the variation and delay after the commission, on their request, had extended the procurement timeline. Akpeneye said, “Telling a MAP to share in where you are providing power is outside the contract, and we will not approve that when it is returned to NERC. “The commission will take it very seriously. At your request, they extended the procurement deadline, and from that duration, anyone who has failed to meet up the requirements, we will have to address that issue,” he warned the DisCos.
