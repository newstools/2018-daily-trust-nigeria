Members of Okam Forum in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have organized a N5 million fund raising dinner to aid education and healthcare interventions in their home state. The chairman of the forum, Emmanuel Abah, said the fund would be used for health and education intervention programmes for Orokam communities in Benue State. “After a decade of community service, Okam Forum has come to a conclusion that there is need to increase the scope of intervention through a new strategy. “Okam Forum believes that the time has come to improve the scope of the intervention and to focus on only health and education because our community’s population is rapidly increasing and more people require the intervention and support. Poverty rate among the people has drastically increased and government presence within the community has correspondingly declined,” he said. He said the capacity of the group’s forum to meet these challenges has been overstretched and therefore there was need to tap the goodwill of the global community. Abah said the forum had a track record of successes including the provision of modern police station, early child school; improved health coverage and welfare packages for community members. He said the fund would be judiciously used and have professionally audited accounts on all projects covered by the donations provided.
