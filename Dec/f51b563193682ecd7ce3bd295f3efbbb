The Buhari Media Organization (BMO) has alleged that the PDP and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar are making plans to rig the 2019 elections with the connivance of “Russian hackers” recruited to hack the online transmission of election results. The BMO in a statement signed by Niyi Akinsiju and Cassidy Madueke, Chairman and Secretary respectively, said credible security sources had confirmed that “The PDP having been blocked on all fronts, and knowing that their barefaced shameless rigging styles cannot be employed under President Buhari, have resorted to engaging hackers to hack into systems that would transmit the 2019 elections results.” According to BMO, “The plan of the PDP hackers is to alter the results that would be transmitted from the polling units to the collation centres, such that what would be sent to the collation centres would be different from what was counted at the polling units.” The PDP had last week debunked similar allegation, saying the claim was the antic of the APC.
