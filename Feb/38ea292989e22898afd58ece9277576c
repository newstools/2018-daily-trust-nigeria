The UN Secretary General has demanded an immediate end to fighting in the Eastern Ghouta in Syria, describing the rebel enclave as a “hell on earth”. “My appeal to all those involved is for an immediate suspension of all war activities,” Antonio Guterres told the UN Security Council on Wednesday. He said a ceasefire would allow humanitarian aid to reach the region. The Eastern Ghouta has been under fierce bombardment from government forces in recent days. The Syrian military says it is trying to liberate the area from what it terms terrorists - but it has also been accused of targeting civilians. “I believe Eastern Ghouta cannot wait,” Mr Guterres said. “This is a human tragedy that is unfolding in front of our eyes and I don’t think we can let things go on happening in this horrendous way.”
