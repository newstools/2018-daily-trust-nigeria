One million children die on the day they are born every year, with another 1.6 million unable to survive past the first month, the UN’s children’s agency said in a new report. Newborns in Pakistan, Central African Republic (CAR) and Afghanistan have the least chance of survival, according to the UNICEF report launched on Tuesday. More than 80 percent of newborn deaths are due to premature births, complications during birth or infections, the report adds, and these deaths can be prevented with access to good quality healthcare and nutrition, as well as clean water and adequate facilities. “Given that the majority of these deaths are preventable, clearly, we are failing the world’s poorest babies,” said UNICEF’s Executive Director Henrietta Fore. Poverty, conflict, and weak institutions are being blamed for pregnant women and infants not receiving the assistance they need.
