The US Supreme Court has inflicted a blow on the Trump administration’s bid to end a programme letting young undocumented immigrants stay in the US. The administration asked the justices whether it was entitled to shut down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) scheme next month. But the high court said it would not hear the case as no appeals court has yet ruled on the issue. Lower courts blocked the president’s plan to scrap Daca by 5 March. The ongoing political and judicial to and fro leaves some 700,000 mostly Hispanic children and young adults - known as Dreamers - in legal limbo. The administration was seeking permission from the Supreme Court to continue dismantling Daca while various legal challenges unfold. But the justices said in a brief order on Monday morning that the appeal was “denied without prejudice”, without explaining their reasoning.
