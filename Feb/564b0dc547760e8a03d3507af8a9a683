Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi yesterday banned herdsmen from entering Ivo Local Government Area of the state. The ban followed clash between one Mr. Daniel Ngwoke and a herder in the area which left the two with serious machete cut. Mr. Ngwoke has been admitted at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki while the herder, whose name has not been given, was receiving treatment at Enugu. The governor, who condemned the attack, called on security men to investigate the matter. “So I want all the security men to carry out my instructions that no herdsmen or cattle should enter Ivo LGA until the investigation is completed and there are other pronouncements that will be made to be executed in the state. “Any herdsmen coming from any state into Ebonyi must follow the procedure and must not carry animal by leg to Ebonyi State but by vehicle,” Umahi said, adding that Ebonyi State has cattle route, grazing reserve or colony.
