A coach travelling along the Pan-American Highway in Peru has plunged off the road, killing at least 35 people, local police say. The accident happened at 01:30 local time (06:30 GMT) near the Ocoña bridge in Peru’s southern Arequipa province. Local media said the coach had fallen from a height that was variously described to be between 80m (260ft) and 200m (650ft). Last month, 52 people died when another coach fell down a cliff in Peru. Arequipa newspaper Diario El Pueblo tweeted a picture of the coach lying on its side by the bank of the river Ocoña. In Wednesday’s incident, the coach, which belongs to the Rey Latino company, was taking passengers from the town of Chala to the city of Arequipa.
