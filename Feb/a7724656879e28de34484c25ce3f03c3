The Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has tasked the state Water Corporation to ensure that every household in Lagos is connected to pipe borne water by the year 2020. Towards this end, the Water Corporation is exploring investment prospects to galvanize private-sector participation on water supply to Lagos residents. The Group Managing Director of the Lagos Water Corporation, Engineer Muminu Badmus, disclosed this while receiving in his office representatives of Elan Expo, who paid him a courtesy visit to intimate him on the 2018 West Africa Waste Water Technologies Expo holding in Lagos between July 10 and 12. The project coordinator for the expo, Mr Jude Chima, decried the challenges being experienced in some parts of Lagos over inadequate water supply, with particular reference to Ikorodu, saying the provision of adequate water supply must be commensurate with the population explosion in the state. But the Lagos Water CEO said the government had in recent times increased supply from 22 to 24 hours on a daily basis, adding that with the massive investment in water supply by the state government, the 2020 target to supply to all households in Lagos would be realized. He expressed the readiness of the corporation to support the expo, which he said aligned with the governmentâ€™s commitment to supply potable water to the residents of Lagos. Badmus also urged the residents to always report cases of burst pipes, disclosing that 15 cases were recorded on a daily basis, to which the corporation had been responding.
