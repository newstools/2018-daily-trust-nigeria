An Ivorian man whose eight-year-old son was smuggled into Spain from Morocco in a suitcase has escaped a jail term. Prosecutors had wanted Ali Ouattara to go to prison for facilitating his son’s illegal entry into Spain. However this was changed to a small fine when they conceded they had found no evidence the father knew his son would be trafficked in a suitcase. “Neither my father nor I knew that they were going to put me in a suitcase,” the boy Adou, now 10, told judges. Adou said Mr Ouattara, who spent a month in prison, had always told him the journey would be made by car.
