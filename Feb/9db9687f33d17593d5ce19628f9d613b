The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has denied allegations of graft and bribery levelled against its men at airports. This is just as the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Command of the service has tagged the counters of its personnel at the airport. The intent was to enable them carry out their duties in line with the Ease of Doing Business policy of the Federal Government which was launched in 2017. Daily Trust gathered that the airport command has 16 counters for immigration processes for arriving passengers. All the counters were tagged with the officersâ€™ names while the same was also done for outbound passengers. The tag is however removed when an officer finishes his or her duty while a new officer who reports for duty also gets tagged for easy identification. It was gathered that the Comptroller General Immigration Service, Mohammed Babandede, who ordered the move, also insisted that its personnel are rightfully empowered to check the travelling documents of any traveller departing or arriving the country. Spokesman for the service, Mr. James Sunday said it was within the purview of the service to ensure that anyone departing the country had the necessary document that would aid his or her travelling. He dismissed reports that immigration officials at the airports demand for bribes from the travelling public.
