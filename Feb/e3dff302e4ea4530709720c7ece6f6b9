The Nigerian military yesterday denied reports that it deliberately suspended operations in the Sambisa Forest which enabled the Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, to escape. In a statement by Colonel Onyema Nwachukwu, the Deputy Director Public Relations of the Theatre Command Operation Lafiya Dole, he described the reports as unfortunate. He also noted that though the Theatre Command considered the misinformation as laughable, it was quite disheartening and capable of dampening the morale ofÂ  troops. He said contrary to the allegations, no such order or directive was given by anybody to any of the units and formations on that operation.
