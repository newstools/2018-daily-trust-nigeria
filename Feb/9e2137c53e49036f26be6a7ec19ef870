 The Coalition for Nigeria Movement (CNM) has urged Nigerians to work with the Federal Government to rescue alive the over 100 female students of the Government Science and Technical College Dapchi, Bursari Local Government Area of Yobe State abducted by alleged Boko Haram insurgents. A spokesman of the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the movement Omoruyi Edoigiawerie said the abduction of the girls is not only an attack on the Country but also an attack on the nation’s collective future and the development of educational institutions especially as it relates to girl-child education. “Wednesday’s attack is an affront on our common humanity and our right to a future. Our youths are no longer the leaders of tomorrow but the drivers of their future and they deserve the freedom and opportunity to shape their future in an enabling environment. While we empathize with the parents of our dear daughters and we pray that they are rescued and reunited with their families, we call on the Federal Government of Nigeria to intensify its fight against terrorism and all forms of extremism and criminality. “Our resolve to push for a Nigeria that typifies Socio-economic development, social justice, equity, equality of opportunity, human security, human rights and most importantly good governance and the general well-being of all its citizens and inhabitants remains unshaken. We realize that the solution to the issues that bedevil our Nation lie in the entrenchment of good Leadership, governance, development and values across all levels of government and we shall not relent until this is achieved,” Edoigiawerie said.
