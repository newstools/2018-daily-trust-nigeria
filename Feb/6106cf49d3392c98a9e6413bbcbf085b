Osun State government has documented the social protection policies of the administration of Governor Rauf Aregbesola to be sent to Osun State House of Assembly. The Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning who is also the chairman of Osun Social Protection Programmes Implementation Committee, Dr. Olalekan Yinusa said the document has been validated and would be transmitted to the House of Assembly soon. The Director General of the Office of Economic Development and Partnership (OEDP), Dr Charles ‘Diji Akinola said the document would help successive governments in the state on matters concerning social protection programmes. Akinola said this in Osogbo, the state capital at a one-day workshop organised by OEDP on the validation of the Osun Social Protection Policy. The DG of OEDP said the workshop was aimed at fully carrying all stakeholders in the state along in the process of developing a comprehensive social protection policy for the state. Participants at the meeting included representatives of the labour unions, private sector, non-governmental organisations, research experts, top government officials from various ministries, departments and agencies, cabinet members as well as chairmen of local government councils in the state. Akinola lauded the United Nations Children Education Fund (UNICEF), Economic Policy Research Institute (EPRI), women groups, academics, and other stakeholders for their contribution to the development of the policy. Akinola said, “We are together making progress in recognising the fact that our State of Osun’s development can only be hastened up, if we work together to eliminate factors that contribute to poverty, inequality and vulnerability. “Presently, social protection is seen by the international community, regional bodies such as the African Union, national and state governments as a policy tool to address such development challenges.”
