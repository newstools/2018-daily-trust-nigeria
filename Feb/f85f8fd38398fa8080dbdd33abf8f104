The former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Alhaji Mahmud Yayale Ahmed, has called on labour unions to be mindful of economic situation in demanding for a new minimum wage. Speaking yesterday in Gombe at the 40 years anniversary of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Yayale said even though the civil servants have a right to seek for better remunerations, “they should also know that the resources are limited.” Mahmud Yayale, who was the chairman of the occasion, therefore recommended a reasonable take home package for workers, but added that, “there was also need to ensure that workers are skilled, trained and efficient, so that the money to be spent on them could not be a waste of resources.” Governor Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo said the labour union has brought positive changes to the country through its struggles over the years. Represented by his deputy, Mr Charles Iliya, the governor commended the state chapter of the NLC for the cordial relationship with government. Earlier, the state chairman of the NLC, Comrade Haruna Kamara, decried the non-payment of gratuity to numerous civil servants that retired from since 2013. He added that some civil servants in the state are still owed salaries for several months due to ongoing verification exercise being conducted by the state government.
