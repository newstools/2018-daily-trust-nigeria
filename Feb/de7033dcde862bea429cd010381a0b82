Russia has vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution based on a UN report condemning Iran for violating an arms embargo by sending weapons to Yemenâ€™s Houthi rebels. Backed by the United States and France, the British-drafted resolution was supported with 11 votes in favour on Monday, before Russia used its veto and other member states abstained from voting. The US had repeatedly called for the imposition of a renewed embargo on Iran, claiming it was sending Iranian manufactured missiles to Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. It also claimed that these missiles were used to launch an attack on neighbouring Saudi Arabia - which along with several Sunni Arab countries - have been fighting against the Houthis since March 2015, when the Kingdom intervened to push back the rebels and reinstate the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
