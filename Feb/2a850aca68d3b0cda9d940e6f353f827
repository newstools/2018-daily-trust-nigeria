There was a mild drama on Monday at a Customary Court sitting in Mapo area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, when the President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade ordered Mutairu Oyebamiji who was accused of selling his cousin’s landed property to produce his client. Oyebamiji who was docked for close to 30 minutes, on hearing the court’s pronouncement that he was guilty of the case, slowly fell in the dock before a court attendant rescued him. Sekinat Omotoso had earlier approached the court that his cousin, Mutairu Oyebamiji sold a plot of land she inherited from her father at Ojo-yankuna village in Ologuneru area of Ibadan. She said despite the court judgment which ordered the buyer of the land and her cousin, Oyebamiji to vacate the land, construction was still ongoing on the site. During a cross examination, Oyebamiji told the court that he was not guilty of the case because he had visited his family house many times to ensure amicable settlement but all his efforts were not fruitful. The President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade held that Oyebamiji violated the court order, adding that he deserves to be remanded in prison. He adjourned the case till April 30 for further hearing and ordered the accused to produce his client.
