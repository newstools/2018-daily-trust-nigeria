The elders of the Obunagu clan in Obeagu Awkunanaw Community in Enugu South Local Government Area of Enugu State have raised the alarm following the rising tension in the area over the activities of land-grabbers and the indefinite postponement of the town union elections. The elders appealed to Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and the Inspector General of Police Mr Ibrahim Idris to intervene to prevent possible breakdown of peace and order. It was gathered that their town union election, which was scheduled for Saturday, February 24, was postponed indefinitely, making it the third time the elections have been put off. Daily Trust gathered that the two factions in the area could not reach an accord at last, hence the consequent crisis in the area is yet to end. In a statement yesterday, the acting chairman of the Obunagu Development Union, Sunday Ngene stated that, “If this election is held, the Obunagu clan will have peace and the structure to enhance development would have been established. But it is sad that some fifth columnists in the community do not want the election to hold. External forces have also infiltrated our ranks in a bid to continue the rush on our communal lands, following the development of the Centenary City Estate.” The traditional ruler of Obeagu Awkunanaw HRH Igwe Mike Nnaukwu said that the crisis was spreading in the 12 communities in Obeagu. He said that “the failure to hold the elections in the past was unavoidable. We are sure that it will be conducted under a peaceful atmosphere. I am aware of the problems with the election.” In a telephone interview, Nnaukwu said that he was worried about the escalation of the issue and cautioned communities in his domain against politicising internal matters. Describing the developments surrounding the election as unfortunate, he admitted that the entire community of Obeagu was embroiled in a clash with land grabbers.
