At least five Iranian security forces were killed in separate car-ramming attacks and a stabbing, blamed on Sufi Muslim followers who had been protesting alleged religious repression by the government in Tehran. Three police officers were killed and several wounded in the first incident on Monday evening, when a minibus ran them over as they tried to contain the Gonabadi Dervish protesters in the Pasdaran district of the capital, Iranâ€™s Fars news agency reported on Tuesday. A Gonabadi Dervish member drove the vehicle involved in the attack, it said. One video clip posted on social media showed a white minibus speeding down a busy Tehran street, as dozens of police officers carrying batons and riot shields gave chase, with onlookers screaming.
