The Nigerian Army and the Kebbi State government have partnered to construct a road in the state. Hosting a team of army engineers who were in the state to inspect the 14 kilometre Kola road project at the Government House in Birnin Kebbi, Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu said Nigerian soldiers deserved commendation for the sacrifices they have made for the development, unity and security of the country.
