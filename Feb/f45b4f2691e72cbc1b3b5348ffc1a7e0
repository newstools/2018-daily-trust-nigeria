Operatives of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS), have once again raided some criminals’ hideouts in the Akala and Idi-Oro areas of Mushin, in the Lagos metropolis. These two areas have notoriety as dens of hardened criminals like armed robbers, rapists and drug addicts. At the end of the operation, which lasted four hours,  three persons were arrested for their alleged involvement in the indiscriminate sale of illicit substances such as Indian hemp, Tramadol and Codeine. Those arrested are Deji Adeyemi, Deji Amosun and Seriki Sadiq. Items recovered at the spots included 183 pawpaw-shaped wraps of Indian hemp, another 129 parcels of Indian hemp wrapped in form of Bibles, and assorted hard drugs. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who confirmed the arrest and the recovery, put the street value of the drugs recovered at about N20 million. Edgal said that the operation was carried out on February 18, 2018 about 12:40p.m. based on credible information from members of the public on the activities of the gang. He said that the information disclosed that suspected members of a secret cult had converged on Idi-Oro and were planning to unleash terror on law- abiding members of the community. He said, “The command immediately obtained a search warrant. He disclosed that one of the associates of the suspects called Choc, whose duty he said was to preserve the drugs for the criminals, was currently at large.”
