President Muhammadu Buhari, last night told governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that he needs more time decide on his re-election in 2019. Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha disclosed this to State House reporters after the governors met with President Buhari last night at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. OKorocha said they all asked Buhari to run for second term in 2019 because of his performance. He said Buhari requested more time to decide and address the nation soon. The meeting, which began at 8:45pm, held at the Conference Room inside the Office of the Wife of the President. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, were also in attendance. The governors had last Friday met with Buhari at his country home of Daura in Katsina State, where they claimed to have merely condoled with the president over the loss of two members of his extended family. Okorocha, who is chairman of the APC governorsâ€™ forum, had told journalists last week that the Daura meeting did not discuss 2019 elections.
