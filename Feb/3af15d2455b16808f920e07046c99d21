The Lagos Computerised Vehicle Inspection Service (LACVIS) was set up by the Lagos State Government to reduce accidents to the barest minimum and save lives. LACVIS was set up to ensure that vehicles are tested using computerised equipment to determine their road worthiness. Spokesperson of the agency, Abike Akintuyi, in an interview, said the “emphasis though is on safety. At LACVIS, we want to ensure that road carnage\bloodbath is reduced to the barest minimum.” She added that, “No society can experience sustained development if it keeps losing its citizens to road crashes on a daily basis. Last year, over 5,000 people lost their lives in road crashes. Imagine the loss to the society. So, setting up LACVIS is the next best thing to address this issue; especially through the timely detection of defects that could cause accidents on the roads.” According to the figure released by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), 4, 410 people lost their lives in road crashes nationwide in 2017. Therefore, Akintuyi urged motorists to be conscious of defects in their vehicles.
