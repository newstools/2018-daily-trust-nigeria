  American health and agriculture regulators are investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium infection across states after linking the outbreak to eating recalled chicken salad. The US Centre for Disease Control and the Department of Agriculture are part of the investigation into an outbreak that's seen at least 65 people infected across five states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 8, 2018 to February 10, 2018. Ill people range in age from 11 to 89 years, with a median age of 57. Forty-two people are female. Twenty-eight hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported. Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that chicken salad produced by Triple T Specialty Meats, Inc. and sold at Fareway grocery stores is the likely source of this multistate outbreak, the CDC said. Public health officials in Iowa first detected this outbreak and linked the illnesses to chicken salad sold at Fareway grocery stores. Fareway has stopped selling chicken salad in all its stores after officials contacted it about the illness. Investigators collected chicken salad from two Fareway grocery store locations in Iowa for laboratory testing. The outbreak strain of Salmonella Typhimurium was identified in both samples. This week, the company making the salad recalled all chicken salad produced from January 2, 2018 to February 7, 2018. CDC recommends that people do not eatÂ  recalled chicken salad. Throw it away or return it to the place of purchase, it warned.
