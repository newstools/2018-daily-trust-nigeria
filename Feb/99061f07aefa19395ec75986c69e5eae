The Lagos State police command has arrested three notorious cultists who allegedly murdered an official of the Neighbourhood and Safety Corp, Bolaji Monsuru. The three suspects were among over 70 cult gang members paraded by the police in Lagos yesterday.

Already, over 70 youths whose ages range from 16 to 34 years have been arrested in connection with cult activities. Of the figure, 57 were arrested while being initiated by the leaders of Aiye in a bush at Elemoro area, Ajah, Lagos State.
