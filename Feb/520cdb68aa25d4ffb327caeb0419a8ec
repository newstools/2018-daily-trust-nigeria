The Presidential Committee on North East Initiative (PCNI) has launched free medical services in Bauchi State. The free medical service is being performed in partnership with Pro-Health International (PHI) and is intended to cover over 5,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and others. Speaking at the venue of the exercise, General Hospital, Bayara, a member of the  PCNI Board Of Trustee(BOT), Engr. Mohammed Gambo Umar, said the programme was part of President Muhammadu Buhari’s health care delivery for vulnerable and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and residents in host communities of the North-East. “Medical outreach initiative was borne out of the successes of our gallant military that have decimated the Boko Haram insurgents and have liberated lots of captives who have lived under poor health conditions,” he said. He added that PCNI engaged Pro-Health International and that 80 different medical practitioners will attend to patients during the exercise. While speaking, Executive Director of Pro Health International (PHI), Dr Iko Ibanga, said the beneficiaries would be examined for various health issues such like eye diseases, Paediatric, antenatal care, dental care and surgical operations.
