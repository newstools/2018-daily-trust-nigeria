Kevin Anderson said he was “thrilled” to be 8th on the ATP world rankings this week. Anderson’s parents, Mike and Barbara of Sandton, Johannesburg had just finished framing a poster of their son after he had reached the 9th spot after winning the New York Open last week. Over the weekend, Anderson messaged his parents after seeing what they had framed and said “you can update the wall poster on Monday again to me at number 8!” “It was an incredible feeling to reach a career-high ranking of number 9 and now I am top 8 … WOW!” tweeted Anderson.
