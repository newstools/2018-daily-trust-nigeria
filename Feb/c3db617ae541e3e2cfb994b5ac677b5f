The Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC) has called on the various political parties and politicians in Nigeria not to deface the city with their campaign posters ahead of 2019 general elections. AMMC Coordinator, Umar Shuiabu, gave this warning when he led FCTA team to the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), John Odigie-Oyegun, in Abuja, to sensitise them on the need to desist from pasting posters on public facilities, such as buildings, walls, signage and others. “The FCTA built this city and we are managing it amidst scarce resources; but the residents are not helping us as they should. So as we are approaching campaign period, the posting of posters will likely increase. That is why we have embarked on this campaign to try and stop it, or at least reduce it to the barest minimum. “We (APC) have to show example for others to follow. As the party in power, we need it to lead the campaign against indiscriminate pasting of posters in Abuja,” he said. The coordinator said penalty for violating this guideline was one million for an organisation and N100, 000 for an individual; including payment for the removal of those posters. The APC chairman who was represented by director of administration in the party secretariat, Abdullahi Y. Gashua, assured the AMMC that he would convey the message to its forthcoming National Working Committee meeting for onward sensitisation. Gashua, however, pledged the cooperation of the APC to the cause of making the city a clean one.
