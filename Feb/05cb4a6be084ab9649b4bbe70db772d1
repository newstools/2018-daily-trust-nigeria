Water experts from across the globe, yesterday, began technical discussions on how best to save the Chad Basin. The experts constitute the majority of the delegates that are participating in the ongoing International Conference on Lake Chad that kicked off in Abuja yesterday. The conference is expected to afford the delegates the opportunity to discuss and come up with a consensus on the different options available to save the Lake Chad from drying up. The experts were drawn from the water subsector from across the world. Their resolutions are expected to form an international acceptable solution for rescuing the lake. According to the organising committee, the three-day event would include two days of technical session, which is expected to be rounded up today, while there would be a high level meeting tomorrow to mark the end of the conference. President Muhammad Buhari is expected to chair the meeting tomorrow.
