The House of Representatives member for Abuja South Federal Constituency, Alhaji Zakari Angulu Dobi, has organised a one day sensitisation campaign against domestic violence for people of his constituency. The event which held at Kwali town hall on Friday, was in collaboration with the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). Dobi said the workshop was meant to educate his constituents on the dangers of domestic violence and how violence can be eradicated in homes. He explained that domestic violence happens among couples and within all age groups and from all ethnic backgrounds and economic status while women and children were commonly victimised. Also speaking, Mrs. Nurat Lawal, who represented the Director General of NAPTIP, said domestic violence included physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive and sexual abuse, which she said ranged from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape to violent physical abuse. “Beside, sexual abuse not only include rape and sexual assault, but it also includes demeaning behavior like exposing a partner’s body to friends and forcing  a partner into posing for photography,” she said.
