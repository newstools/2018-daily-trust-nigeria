Former Rector of the Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti, Dr. Taiwo Akande, is being investigated by the management of the institution over alleged mismanagement of workers’ promotion arrears put at N98 million. The Governing Council of the school had earlier suspended the Registrar, Mrs. Sade Adediran and the Bursar, Mr. E.A. Onaolapo and appointed Mr. J.O. Awoniyi and Mr. E.O. Aboluje as the acting registrar and acting bursar respectively. According to a statement signed by the Deputy Registrar, Information, Mr. Ade Adeyemi-Adejolu, the suspended officers have been ordered to step aside for a period of three months “consequent upon an ongoing restructuring.” The statement said the decision was arrived at during the council’s statutory meeting held on 15 February while considering the recommendations of the report of one of its ad hoc committees raised to look into operations of the Akande-led management. The council has set up a fact-finding panel to investigate the wrongdoings allegedly perpetrated by Akande in collaboration with Adediran and Onaolapo between 2015 and 2017. The panel is to turn in its report ahead of the next statutory meeting of the Council scheduled for May 2018. But Akande, in a telephone interview said she was not aware that her tenure was being probed and denied knowledge about promotion arrears which she said was the responsibility of the Budget Office. “We have made a presentation to the Budget Office and that is all I can say about it for now. Let them contact me so that I can talk better.”
