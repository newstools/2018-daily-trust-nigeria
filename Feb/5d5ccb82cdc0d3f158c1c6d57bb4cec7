President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday hit back at Transparency International over its corruption perception index indicating that corruption was getting worse in Nigeria. Buhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity Malam Garba Shehu, described as misleading and unfair, the ranking of 148 given Nigeria out if 180 countries surveyed. Shehu said President Buhari asked the anti-corruption watchdog to focus on facts, not fiction. He said while the Presidency noted and welcomed constructive criticism, the organization has a responsibility to reflect the larger picture of the concrete and verifiable achievements of the administration since it came into office.
