The Ogun State chapter of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV) yesterday visited the Stella Obasanjo Motherless Baby Home, Ibara GRA, Abeokuta, to donate to and identify with the children at the Home as part of activities to mark its 2018 Week. The state chairman of the NIESV, Salmon Shobanke, said the visit was aimed at getting closer to children, who, he pointed out, became inmates there through circumstances they couldn’t control. Shobanke said, “We have come to identify with them. These are children who had found themselves here due to no fault of theirs. As a responsible body with hearts to identify with the less privileged in the society, particularly these little babies, we considered it appropriate to come down and celebrate our week with them.” He added that the body was impressed by the turnaround and upliftment the Home had been given by the Ogun State government, stressing, “It makes the environment more inviting for the visitors, and conducive for the workers and children under their care.” Items the surveyors donated included food items and sundry needs for the home. On the state of the profession, the NIESV Chairman expressed concern on the low number of registered estate surveyors and valuers in the country. “About 5000 members for a population of about 180 million, and with only 50 registered members in Ogun State, are grossly inadequate for effective practice of the profession,” he said.
