A former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika (rtd), was yesterday interrogated on his role in the now infamous arms deal scandal. Daily Trust learnt that Ihejirika, who came to the EFCC Headquarters, Abuja, at about 11am was being questioned as part of the ongoing investigations into the $2.1 billion arms scandal involving a former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd). He was questioned as related to the procurement of arms and ammunition during the time he held sway as Chief of Army Staff between September 2010 and January 2014. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwajuren, confirmed the development last night. He said Ihejirika would be released on administrative bail as soon as preliminary interrogations were over, as he has also requested to go back and gather more information, expressing unawareness as regards various documents and questions put to him by investigators.
