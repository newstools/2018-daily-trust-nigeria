US evangelist Billy Graham - one of the most influential preachers of the 20th Century - has died aged 99. Graham became one of the best-known promoters of Christianity, beginning his worldwide mission in large arenas in London in 1954. He died at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, a spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said. In a 60-year career, he is estimated to have preached to hundreds of millions of people. Graham reached millions of them through TV - the first to use the medium to convey the Christian message on that scale. Born in 1918 and raised on his familyâ€™s dairy farm in Charlotte, North Carolina, Billy Graham became a committed Christian at the age of 16 after hearing a travelling evangelist.
