The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) Nigeria has said it is targeting $1.05bn for humanitarian needs in the North-East ravaged by Boko Haram insurgency. This is as the leader of the Network of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Borno State (NECSOB) Ambassador Shehu Ahmed said the Oslo conference shows that the world cares for Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, hence the need for regional CSOs to play their part. The UN-OCHA Representative in Nigeria Mrs Alta Bell made the disclosure yesterday in Abuja at the meeting of the Network of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Lake Chad region comprising Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroun.
