A Pakistani official says a blasphemy suspect who suffered serious injuries after jumping off a federal building is now in stable condition. Khwaja Hammad, a senior official of Federal Investigation Agency, said Sunday that Sajid Masih is recovering at a hospital in Lahore. He denies that the suspect was abused or tortured. Masih was summoned by the Cyber Crime Wing on Friday for allegedly posting blasphemous material on Facebook. He told local media that officials tortured him and confiscated his mobile phone.
