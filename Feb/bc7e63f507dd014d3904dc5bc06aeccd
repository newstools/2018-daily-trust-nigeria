President Muhammadu Buhari has rejected the bill seeking to establish the Nigeria Peace Corps. The president said the functions of the corps as contained in the bill were duplication of existing security agencies. Both chambers of the National Assembly had months ago passed the bill and transmitted it to the President for assent. But in a letter read by Speaker Yakubu Dogara during plenary session yesterday, Buhari cited Section 58(4) of the Constitution as the basis for his refusal to assent the bill. Buhari said in the letter dated January 25, 2018, that “Pursuant to section 58(4) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), I hereby convey to the House of Representatives, my decision, on 25th January, 2018 to decline Presidential Assent to the Nigeria Peace Corps (Establishment) Bill, 2017 recently passed by the National Assembly. “Specifically, reasons for the decision to decline assent to this bill include among others: Security concerns regarding the proposed Nigerian Peace Corps being authorised to undertake activities currently being performed by extant security and law enforcement agencies; and; ‘Financial implications of funding the establishment and operations of the proposed Nigerian Peace Corps, given the scarce financial resources may pose serious challenge to the government.’
