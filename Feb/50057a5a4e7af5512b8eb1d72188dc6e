  Ebonyi state has banned herdsmen from entering Ivo local government area of the state. Governor David Umahi announced the ban on Tuesday after a clash between a resident Daniel Ngwoke and a herdsman in the area left both men with machete cuts. Ngwoke is hospitalised at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, and the herdsman is receiving treatment at Enugu, while investigations go on. "No herdsmen should enter Ivo local government until this investigation is completed. "So I want all the security men to carry out my instructions that no herdsmen or cattle should enter Ivo LGA until the investigation is completed and there are other pronouncement that will be made to be executed in the state. "My prayers remain that all will be alive till after the investigation because the first aggression will go to prison in this state no matter whom the person may be. "Any herdsmen coming from any state into Ebonyi, must follow the procedure and must not carry animal by leg to Ebonyi State but by vehicle. Umahi noted that there is no cattle route in Ebonyi state, no grazing reserve and colony.
