Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha has called on men of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) to concentrate on checking the activities of smugglers at the Nigerian borders instead of mounting roadblocks when goods have already been smuggled into the country. The governor also called for a summit between Igbo traders and the Nigerian Customs to correct certain impressions that some of the actions and policies of the Customs are targeted at the Igbo businessmen. Okorocha spoke yesterday when the Comptroller of Customs, Federal Operations, Zone C, Mr. Azarema. A. Abubakar paid him a courtesy call at the Government House, Owerri. The governor said such summit could help in correcting such impressions. Okorocha regretted that there has been a communication gap between the Customs authorities and the Igbo businessmen, adding that Communication is key in the relationship between the two groups. While advising them on border control, the governor said NCS could not be seen to be doing their job when they allow smugglers to have free reign at the borders only to go later and mount roadblocks to apprehend smuggled goods. He added that if the Customs personnel do what they are expected to do at the borders, they would have no business mounting roadblocks again in the cities. He said, “Custom operatives should concentrate at the borders and not inside the cities, chasing goods or materials that have passed the borders which shows leakage at the borders. Once the goods have passed the borders and enter the cities, checking them becomes the duty of the police and no more the functions of the customs’ officials.” Comptroller Customs, Federal Operations Zone C, Mr Azarema A. Abubakar told the governor that Zone C is the hub of trade which makes it incumbent on them to seek for Cooperation and support of the governor.
