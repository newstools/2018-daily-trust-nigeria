China’s ruling party is considering scrapping term limits for the president and vice president, it announced on Sunday. The Communist party of China has proposed to change the country’s constitution so that the president and vice president can serve more than two consecutive terms. Currently, there is a limit of two five-year terms for both presidents and vice presidents. The amendment would allow current President Xi Jinping, 64, to be elected again during the next elections in 2023. Although not final yet, Al Jazeera’s correspondent, Divya Gopalan, said the change is very likely to happen. Details of when the constitutional reforms will be introduced into parliament were not made public yet in Sunday’s announcement.
