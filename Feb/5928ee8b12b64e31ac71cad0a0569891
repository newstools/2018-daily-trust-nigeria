Assets Declaration Forms of members of the House of Representatives and civil servants will now be made public to deepen the anti-corruption fight, Speaker Yakubu Dogara has said. He said this would prevent anticipatory declaration of assets by representatives, which had fuelled corrupt practices in the country. Dogara spoke through Babajide Akinloye (APC, Lagos) at the opening ceremony of a dialogue on reform of justice sector and campaign against corruption organized by the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) in Abuja yesterday. He said the House recently organized an anti-corruption seminar, where it was agreed that asset forms would now be made open to members of the public. “For the National Assembly I assure you that we will do everything possible to fight corruption and make Nigeria a better place to live in,” he said.
