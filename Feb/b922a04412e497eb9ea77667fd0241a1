The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Osun State command, has sensitised youths in Osun State on the danger of drug abuse, cultism and hooliganism, and charged them to strive to be responsible citizens. The sensitisation programme was organised by an Islamic organisation based in Iwo, Osun State, the Jam’atu Ta’awunil Muslimeen, under the leadership of Dr Shafi’i Abdul-Azeez Bello. The Head of the Drug Demand Reduction unit of the NDLEA, Osun State command, Dr Funmi Ofoha, while delivering a lecture during the sensitisation programme held at the Iwo City Hall, advised youths to shun drug abuse, cultism and hooliganism. The NDLEA officer pointed out the consequences of drug abuse, cultism and hooliganism, and warned Nigerian youths to stay away from any tendency that could predispose them to danger and ruin their future. Dr Ofoha commended the Jam’atu Ta’awunil Muslimeen for organising the programme and assured the group of continuous support from the NDLEA. The Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi, also lauded Dr Bello and assured that he would not hesitate to partake in the group’s programmes, particularly on youth development. Dr Shafi’i Abdul-Azeez Bello said experiences had shown that the Nigerian society was in serious danger due to incessant attacks on innocent people by cultists, particularly in the higher institutions of learning. “The emergence of thugs and hooligans sporadically increases in our society on the platform of drug abuse. The actors of this phenomenon are majorly youths who should be the leaders of tomorrow,” he said.
