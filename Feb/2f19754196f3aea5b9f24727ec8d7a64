Crisis and irreconcilable difference have been described as some of the factors delaying the take-off of the Ogoni clean-up in the Niger Delta. A conflict resolution expert and peace negotiator, Dr Judith Burdin Asuni, said this in an interview with Daily Trust in Port Harcourt. She called on the people of Niger Delta to embrace peace and use dialogue to resolve the lingering crisis in the region. Dr Asuni, who is the Executive Director of Academic and Peace Works, said she initiated the ‘Second Ogoni Dialogue Forum’ and ‘Niger Delta Dialogue’ to negotiate peace and resolve conflict in Ogoniland and Niger Delta region. Dr Asuni said the Ogoni Dialogue is aimed at opening up Ogoniland for development with the need for collaboration and coordination. “We started the Niger Delta Dialogue in 2016 at the heat of violence in the region when oil facilities were being destroyed by the Niger Delta Avengers” She called on the youths of Niger Delta to shun violence and embrace peace and use dialogue as a means of resolving the crisis in the region.
