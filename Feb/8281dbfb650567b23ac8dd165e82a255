The wife of the senate president, Toyin Saraki, has called on every Nigerian to be more involved in security situation around them as part of measures to check insurgency. She made this remark while speaking with journalists in Ilorin on Wednesday after an advocacy visit by the Wellbeing Foundation Africa (WBA) her nongovernmental organization, to the Kwara state House of Assembly. Saraki lamented the recent abduction of 111 young school girls in Dapchi, Yobe state saying that Nigerians never believed another abduction could happen again in the country. "No one ever actually believed that we will still see another forcible abduction again in the country again after all the sufferings, tears, lamentation and efforts taken to rescue some of the Chibok girls. It's very hard to describe how I feel as a woman and mother about the development. "I want to recall what my husband said in that every head must be counted and accounted for. And having registered some success by the release of some Chibok girls, it gave me the hope that we will get back the Dapchi girls and reunite them with their family. "I want to ask every Nigerian to be vigilant. If you notice that there are strange faces in your community that were not there before, or somebody buying more food than they buy normally, or you notice somebody sowing more materials than they sow normally, please contact the security authorities. The sooner we can find them, get them back, the better for the humanity", she said.
