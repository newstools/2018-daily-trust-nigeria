Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun has rejoiced with renowned cinematographer and photographer, Mr. Tunde Kelani, as he turns 70 years. Amosun, in a statement signed by the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Otunba Adedayo Adeneye, described Kelani as an epitome of cinema, who has also used his exemplary skills to promote the rich Yoruba cultural heritage worldwide. The governor said the story teller and filmmaker, who was appointed the chairman of the National Film and Videos Censors Board (NFVCB), by President Muhammadu Buhari, is a worthy Nigerian, distinguished Yoruba man and a pride to Ogun State. He said Kelani deserves commendation and celebration, for rising from a local photographer to the head of his privately owned film producing company, Mainframe, acclaimed for producing chart bursting films. He wished Kelani more prosperous and health years as he celebrates his 70 years.
