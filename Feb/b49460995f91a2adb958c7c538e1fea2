A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Wednesday sentenced 27-year-old Tijjani Ahmed to three months imprisonment for stealing clothes valued at N24,000. Ahmed, who resides at Jabi Motor Park, was convicted after he pleaded guilty to charges bordering on criminal trespass and theft and pleaded for leniency. The Judge, Abubakar Sadiq, warned the convict to desist from crime in future and also gave him an option to pay N5,000 fine. Earlier, the prosecutor, Dalhatu Zannah, had told the court that one Ugochukwu Livinus of Jabi reported the matter at Utako Police Station on Feb. 16. Zannah said that the convict criminally entered the complainant’s dry cleaning shop and made away with his customers’ clothes valued at N24,000. The prosecutor said that during Police investigation, Ahmed confessed that he stole the clothes. The offence contravened Sections 348 and 288 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
