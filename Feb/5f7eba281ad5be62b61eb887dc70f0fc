The Kaduna State College of Education (KSCOE) Gidan Waya has made a case for the inclusion of additional degree courses to meet increasing demand from prospective students at the institution. The College Administrator, Professor Joseph Choms, who was represented by the Registrar, Mr. Simon Tukura, made the appeal during the Matriculation ceremony for 2017/2018 batch of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) affiliated Bachelor of Education (BEd) programme at Gidan Waya campus. The administrator, who also commended the management of ABU for increasing the number of admitted students, also called for additional courses to the 11 presently undertaken. Speaking at the matriculation of 431 students at the college, the Vice Chancellor of ABU, Prof. Ibrahim Garba, who was represented by the Dean of Faculty of Education, Prof. Yahaya Kajuru, told the students to consider themselves lucky to have been admitted. “Over 12,400 candidates applied for admission into the 12 affiliated Colleges of Education out of which only a little above 5,000 were admitted,” he said. The Don then urged the students to abide by ABU rules and regulations and also shun all forms of anti-social behaviour.
