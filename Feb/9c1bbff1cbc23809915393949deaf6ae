The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has requested the National Population Commission (NPC) to furnish it with data on voters, who have died after the last general elections. INEC plans to utilise the data in expunging their names from the Voters’ Register. The request was made yesterday in Abuja when the INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, visited the headquarters of the Population Commission. Yakubu said INEC would do everything possible to clean up the Voters’ Register before the 2019 elections, including expunging the names of dead people and underage voters. He said between the last general elections held in 2015 and now, many people have died and INEC would partner with the Population Commission to identify and remove them from the database. He also requested partnership of the NPC in the demarcation of enumeration areas for the purpose of the election. The Chairman of the Population Commission, Chief Eze Duruiheoma, said INEC’s requests would be granted, adding that though Nigeria’s birth and death statistics are not comprehensive, the available data would be forwarded to INEC.
