Liberia’s new president George Weah has said he inherited “a country that is very broke, depleted a political malfeasance”, reports AFP news agency. The former footballer, who is currently in France, said he ordered a complete audit “to make sure that what belongs to the government goes to the government”. Speaking on his first official trip abroad as president, he said healthcare and education are lacking. “I believe in education. Yes, I didn’t have the opportunity in my early days but after my carrier I went back to school. Today I can boast of a masters degree. “Liberia is the oldest African country but we don’t have an engineering school. We don’t even have a diagnosis centre to tell if someone has Ebola,” he said.
