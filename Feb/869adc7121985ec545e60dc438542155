Seven suspects accused of killing South African police have been shot dead in a gunfight at a church, police say. Those killed in the shoot-out are thought to be part of the armed gang that killed six in a raid on a police station in the country’s Eastern Cape Province on Wednesday. Ten suspects were also arrested at the church in Nyanga village, while others escaped, investigators said. Police say the gang was cornered as they hid in the church. National Police Commissioner Khehla John Sitole told a crowd outside the church on Saturday that the police were determined to bring the alleged police attackers to justice. “We made a decision that this is not going to happen in South Africa where the state will be undermined by criminals,” he said, according to African outlet News24.
