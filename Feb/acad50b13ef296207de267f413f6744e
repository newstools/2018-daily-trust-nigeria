Three persons, who the police described as notorious cult gang members, have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the death of a security man, Moshood Bolaji, attached to the Lagos State Neighbourhood Watch. The identities of those arrested among a gang of five could not be ascertained at press time yesterday. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, has ordered for a manhunt for some fleeing members of the gang. The deceased, Moshood Bolaji, was hacked to death on Wednesday about 9.30p.m., at the  Umunede Bar, Mallam Isah Close, Aguda-Surulere, in the Lagos metropolis, allegedly by the cultists. A police source said that those arrested were being detained at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, where they were being questioned. It was gathered that the suspects had made useful statements and had promised to help the police fish out the fleeing gang members, who were said to have bolted immediately after attacking the deceased on motorcycle. Edgal, during a condolence to the  Aguda-Surulere office of the Lagos State Neighbourhood Watch yesterday to  commiserate with officials of the security outfit, directed that a team of operatives attached to the State Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and from the Anti-Cultism Squad be drafted to the area and ensure they fish out the killers. The commissioner also paid a condolence visit to the family of the late Bolaji, where he vowed that any criminal who dare snuffed life out of any member of any security group in the state would not be allowed to go unpunished.
