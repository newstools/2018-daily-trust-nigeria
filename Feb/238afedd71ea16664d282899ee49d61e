The three lecturers of the University of Maiduguri recently freed by the Boko Haram have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to relocate them and give them new jobs. They made the plea at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday when they were hosted by President Buhari. They said going back home was still a nightmare following their experiences in captivity. Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Dr Solomon Nicholas Yusuf said they appreciated everything done to ensure their freedom. “Sir, from the university, it is a golden opportunity for us to see you and to share our fears and concern because we were abducted while working for the nation. “And right now going back home to us is still a nightmare because of our experiences. Sir, we have this golden plea with all due respect sir, if there is an opportunity for us to be relocated and maybe given another job, sir, this is our golden request. This is the only opportunity we have to share with you. But we appreciate everything done, the sacrifice you have given to us, thank you sir. “We also want to appreciate the DSS, the Nigerian Armed Forces, and the entire team that worked together to make sure we regained our freedom. We appreciate their labour and love they have shown to us. “We also want to appreciate Nigerians for praying. We were informed that the entire nation was praying for us and we were excited and we said oh God, what is this? This is love. Sir, we are grateful.”
