The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has asked doctors around the country not to take part in re-sit examinations planned by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) for foreign-trained doctors who failed a previous assessment last December. Some 443 students, who studied medicine abroad, failed the assessment, making them ineligible for practice licence in Nigeria. Their failure dragged the MDCN, which regulates medicine and dentistry, into controversy, prompting the regulator to agree to a re-sit exam on February 28 at University of Abuja Teaching Hospital. NMA said the notion of a re-sit is “Embarrassing, an abnormal development that will cast a negative aspersion on the quality of MDCN to the medical world.” “Nowhere in the world is a re-sit examination conducted for licensing fresh graduates,” said NMA President Dr Mike Ogirima in a statement on Tuesday. The other 249 students who passed the exam were inducted on February 14.
