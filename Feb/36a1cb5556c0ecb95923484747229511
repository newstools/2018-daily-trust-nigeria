Former Manchester City midfielder and France international Samir Nasri was handed a six-month doping ban by European football governing body Uefa on Tuesday “for using a prohibited method”. Nasri, 30, had appealed to Uefa for a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) following a multi-vitamin intravenous booster he received at a Los Angeles clinic in 2016. That was rejected last March, as was an appeal in December to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. However, he still has the right to appeal against his ban, UEFA said.
