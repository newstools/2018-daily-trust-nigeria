The traditional ruler of Itori in Ewekoro area of Egbaland, Ogun State, Oba Abdul-Fatai Akamo has called on his subjects and other residents of the state, to ensure regular payment of  taxes as a way to support government’s efforts to turn around the state for better. Oba Akamo made the call while speaking at the occasion of his 14th coronation ceremony held in his palace in Itori, at the weekend. “Let us continue to support the government in every way we can, especially by paying our taxes regularly and by fulfilling all other obligations to the government of the day. We thank his excellency, Senator Ibikunle Amosun for his efforts and interest in ensuring steady development in our area,” the monarch said. The royal father expressed optimism that his domain would soon be turned into ‘Eldorado” following the rail line project passing through the community and the cargo airport, which the state government has attracted to the local government from the Federal Government. He appealed to his subjects “to allow peace to continue to reign in our midst, so that we can continue to enjoy the dividends of democracy which the current government is spreading to all nooks and crannies of Ogun State.” Oba Akamo also thanked all private firms both local and international for their interest in the community in citing industries, which he noted has reduced crime rate through employment opportunities. Oba Akamo equally expressed appreciation to his subjects and chiefs, stating that his journey on the throne could not have been adventurous and interesting if not for their love and cooperation.
