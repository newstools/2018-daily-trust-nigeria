 President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration will always work towards an inclusive economy that adequately caters for Nigerian workers and their families. President Buhari noted that this had started with the ongoing review of the minimum wage. The president, according to a statement yesterday by his spokesman Mr Femi Adesina, said this in his congratulatory message to the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) on its 40th anniversary. Buhari joined all Nigerian workers, retirees and pensioners in celebrating the milestone of the vibrant labour union which, he said, that had lived up to the expectations of its founding fathers by protecting the interest of the Nigerian worker through viable engagements with public and private sector employers. He affirmed that the NLC had burgeoned into a matured and focused umbrella for all workers in the last four decades by consistently projecting the voice of the workers and negotiating a healthier position for them on the rungs of the Nigerian economy. Buhari extolled present and past leaderships of the NLC for their contributions to the development of the nation which, according to him, includes their historical struggle for the return of democratic governance, and penchant for always speaking the truth to those in power."
