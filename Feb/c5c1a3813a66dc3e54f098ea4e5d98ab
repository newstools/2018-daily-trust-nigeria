Four notable Nigerian architects, who sought to get a judicial verdict to dissolve their regulatory body, Architects Registration Council of Nigeria (ARCON), have lost that bid. In a suit instituted byÂ  Tonye Braide, Abimbola Ajayi, David Majekodunmi and Dike Emmanuel against ARCON, the plaintiffs, sought among others a legal pronouncement that the present ARCON had since been dissolved, but the court ruled otherwise. Justice Hadiza Shagari of a Federal High Court, Lagos, concluded that the case was unmeritorious and consequently dismissed it. While Braide was the immediate past president, Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA), Ajayi was the General Secretary and Majekodunmi the Chairman of the Students Affairs Committee. Emmanuel was the Chairman, International Affairs Committee in the last executive members of the professional group. To clear the air over the heated controversy surrounding reports on the court case, the current NIA president, Adibe Njoku said that the plaintiffs in the case went to court in their personal capacity. According to him, the case has nothing to do with NIA, as there was no time the council of the professional body endorsed the legal action against ARCON. Njoku said NIA, as a body never initiated any suit against ARCON in the recent time, describing reports that NIA sued ARCON as misleading.
