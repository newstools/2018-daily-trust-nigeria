President Muhammadu Buhari says the chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Anti-corruption, Professor Itse Sagay, is defending his administration robustly while stepping on many toes in the process. The president described Sagay as a man of conviction who is doing an exceptional job. Buhari spoke at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday while receiving a delegation of Itsekiri leaders led by the Olu of Warri, Ogiame Ikenwoli. Buhari, according to a statement by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, commended Itsekiri people for producing men of strong conviction like Sagay. The president reiterated his administrationâ€™s commitment to maintaining peace and security in the Niger Delta for economic and social activities to thrive.
