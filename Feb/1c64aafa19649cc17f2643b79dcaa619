A Kano based politician, Alhaji Ibrahim Al-Amin Little, has been attacked by gunmen at Kidan-Dan town, near Birnin Gwari, Kaduna State. One of his aides, who narrated what happened to our correspondent, said the gunmen opened fire at Little and his driver while they were about entering the car after coming out from the farm. He said they shot the politician on the arm and he fell to the ground. â€œProbably thinking that he died, they ran back into the bush. But after some time he was able to struggle and come out and drove to Kaduna with the driver. He said Little, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano, is receiving treatment at a private hospital in Kaduna and would be operated upon later to remove the bullet in his arm. Efforts to get the police public relations officer, Mukhtar Hussaini Aliyu did not yield fruit as he was not picking his calls.
