President Muhammadu Buhari wants more Nigerians to speak while still consulting before making up his mind on seeking re-election next year. Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State told newsmen in Abuja yesterday that he disclosed this to All Progressives Congress (APC) governors at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja late Thursday. “I’m very comfortable that Nigerians will speak loud,” he said. Bello, while addressing State House reporters after a two-hour closed-door meeting, said: “There are three things. One, [the president] has done well. Secondly, on fighting corruption. Even we, the governors, are competing among ourselves to ensure that the little resources available, we utilize them for the people. So, corruption is reduced to the barest minimum. “Next is the revival of the economy, job creation and making sure that average Nigerians are comfortable. Based on this performance, we are urging Mr. President to please run and fly in 2019. If you look at it critically, the governors themselves, who naturally have immunity, are very careful because you know that Mr. President is incorruptible.” On the allegation by the national leader of the APC, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, that the party’s national chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun, was sabotaging the ongoing reconciliation efforts, Bello said the APC governors had confidence in Oyegun. “We also believe in the president by appointing Bola Tinubu, our leader, to reconcile some aggrieved members of our party. However, one-size-fits-all will not (work) in all the states where some erring members need to be disciplined,” he said. Tinubu had, in a letter to Oyegun, faulted what he called the “hurried” inauguration of a caretaker committee of the APC in Kogi State.
