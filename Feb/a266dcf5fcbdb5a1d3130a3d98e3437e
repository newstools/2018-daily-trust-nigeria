A self-styled prophet has been arrested after 17 children were allegedly held captive in his home in Mozambique. Luis Gouveia Inroga said he had recruited the children, aged between nine and 16 years, in November so that they could learn the Bible. However, he also also encouraged them to disobey their parents and keep their distance from “worldly” things, including school and television, which he said were “satanic”. Mr Inroga, who lives in the central city of Chimoio, told reporters he had received a divine calling requiring him to take people out of sin.
