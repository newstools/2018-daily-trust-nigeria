The striking members of the non-teaching staff unions of universities yesterday disrupted mock Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife and Bayero University Kano (BUK). Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Registrar, Professor Is-haq Oloyede disclosed this in Abuja. He said the non teaching staff stormed exam centres at BUK and OAU and stopped candidates from taking the mock UTME. “We have discussed with the vice-chancellors of the institutions and agreed that if the situation persists, we shall move the candidates to other centres to write the exam,” he said. A total of 211,000 out of the 1,662, 781 candidates that applied for the 2018 UTME wrote the mock exams yesterday in 602 centres.
