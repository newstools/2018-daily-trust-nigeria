Others were Mr Mohammed Yahaya, Ministry of Works, Housing and Transport and Tanko Zubair, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives. The statement also indicated that six commissioners retained their jobs, but with Mr Jamil Zakari moved from Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources to Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism. The Special Advisers who lost their jobs were Hajarat Ibrahim Danyaro, Gender Relations, Rehabilitation and Disabilities and Ado Mohammed of Community-Based Relations/Conflict Resolution and Management. The statement revealed that former Special Adviser to the Governor on Security, Lt.-Gen.
