The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) will soon commence work on coastal roads projects in Delta State, Executive Director Projects of the commission, Samuel Adjogbe has said. A statement yesterday said Adjogbe made the disclosure at his Evwreni country home, Ughelli North Local Government Area, Delta state shortly after he was invested as Patron of the Buhari Support Group Centre (BSGC). He said the 69 km road network and 22 bridges will link the coastal communities for effective oil exploration and maximum utilization of the Nigeria Maritime University, Okerenkoko. “We are connecting to Excravos because we have federal government presence in the Excravos Terminal, like the Chevron terminal and Shell locations and the roads will open up the areas so that the operational cost of the companies in that areas will come down and once that is done, more profit will go to the federal government and more allocations would go to the states that depend on crude oil,” Adjogbe said. Describing the award presented to him as a call to do more, he advised the people of Niger Delta region to give massive support to President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 general election.
