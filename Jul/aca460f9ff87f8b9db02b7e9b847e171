The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has condemned the latest wave of killings of Nigerians by fellow Nigerians in South Africa, describing the new trend as “worrisome and dangerous”. A 42 year-old Nigerian, Linus Chibuzor-Nwankwo from Enugu State was allegedly shot dead by a fellow Nigerian, Lawrence Nwarienne from Anambra State, who was operating a bar in South Africa. The Consul General of Nigeria in South Africa, Godwin Adama, had said the incident happened in the early hours of Friday in Kempton Park, Johannesburg in South Africa. He said the motive for the killing was not yet clear but the suspect had been arrested by the police and investigation commenced. “The last three killings have been alleged to be Nigerians killing Nigerians. This is quite worrisome and a more dangerous trend, Dabiri-Erewa said in a statement yesterday in Abuja. “For the first time, six policemen involved in killing of Nigerians over the years have recently been arrested and to be arraigned in court soon. “Nigerian Government will continue to demand justice for killings but this element of Nigerians killing fellow Nigerians in another country will only complicate matters,” she said.
