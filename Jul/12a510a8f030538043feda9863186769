Change Managers International Network and UN Women in Nigeria have called for increased women participation and representation in governance in the country. The president of Change Managers International Network, Mrs. Felicia Onibon, made the call at a 3-day workshop with the theme, ‘Strengthening Capacities of Political Parties to Develop and Reform Policies and Procedures to Promote Women’s Participation’. She said the main focus of the workshop was to train officials of political parties to have good knowledge of gender dynamics and how they themselves could use the knowledge in supporting women participation in all political activities. She noted that the role of women was crucial to national development and that they should be given equal access to opportunities especially in the political arena. Onibon who debunked the assertion that women were apolitical, canvassed for support for their participation in all political activities to prove their mettle in leadership positions. Earlier in her remarks, the Programme Associate, Women Political Leadership & Empowerment (UN Women), Patience Ekechukwu, said investing in women for political leadership was the right thing to do, considering their role in building strong and stable democratic processes.
