A presidential aspirant under the Grassroot Development Party of Nigeria  (GDPN),  in the forthcoming 2019 election Davidson Akhimien, has called on the Federal Governmental to order the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to the arrest and prosecution all those behind the killings in Plateau and Benue State in the interest of the nation. Akhimien stated that the numerous killings have not only become worrisome but also threatening the peace and stability of Nigeria. Akhimien while flagging off his presidential campaign team in Lagos yeaterday decried the gruesome murder of over a hundred innocent citizens in Plateau State allegedly by herdsmen whose regime, he said  has become increasingly worrisome by the day. Akhimien who is also the national president of the Association of Licensed Private Security Practitioners of Nigeria (ALPSPN) condoled with families of the victims of the pogrom and  wondering why Nigeria should continue to witness the spill of the blood of innocent and defenceless citizens at a time the country was not at war with another country. Akhimien who served in the Directorate of Military Intelligence (among other units) in the Nigerian Army, promised that if elected president of the country in 2019, would strategically reposition the nation’s security forces by re-evaluating the entire national security architecture, being mindful of the federal structure of the country and the need to uphold balance and efficiency in the appointment of security chiefs. “This terror regime must stop and the only way to stop it, as the Buhari administration appears incapable of doing so, is to enthrone a leadership that has deep feeling for the pains and anguish of the less privileged who have continued to suffer years of neglect, oppression and depression in the hands of the leaders,” he stressed.
