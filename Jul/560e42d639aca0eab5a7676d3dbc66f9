Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni has ordered extra security for Uganda’s 456 lawmakers, including the deployment of sharp-shooters and armoured escort vehicles. The move comes after a ruling party lawmaker was shot dead on 8 June, and the earlier killing of a senior police officer and prosecutor. The murders have remained unsolved. In a letter to the finance ministry, Mr Museveni said he had discussed incidents of “criminality and terrorism” with the MPs. He wanted the finance ministry to “act fast” and release money so that their security could be bolstered, Mr Museveni said.
