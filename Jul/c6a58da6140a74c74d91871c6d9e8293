The coordinator of FCT Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD), Isyaku Tanko Yamawo, and 250 others have joined the Grassroots Mobilizers for Buhari (GMB)  for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019. Yamawo stated this when he paid a courtesy visit to the national chairman of GMB,  Hajiya Fatima Mohammed Goni, in her office on Friday in Abuja. He said being one of the chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT, it had become imperative for him to mobilize 250 party members to join the group. He said the performance of Buhari in the last three years, especially in infrastructure, fighting corruption, improving security and the economy, encouraged him to work and ensure the president emerged victorious during the forthcoming election. “I want to assure the national chairman of GMB that we have procured an office for the group in the FCT, where all members of the group will be deliberating all issues regarding the success of this movement,” he said. Responding, Hajiya Goni expressed delight with the STDD coordinator and his members for joining the group. She stressed the need for APC stakeholders in the territory to work as a team to ensure that the people at the grassroots obtained their PVCs ahead of the 2019 elections. The national chairman of GMB later handed over 260  membership forms to STDD coordinator.
