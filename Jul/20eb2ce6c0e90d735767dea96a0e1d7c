 The Gombe State Government has warned young people to be wary of politicians who delight in using them as thugs to achieve selfish interests as 2019 general election draws near. The Governor, Alhaji Ibrahim Dankwambo gave the warning while declaring the Unity Congress of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, open on Saturday in the State. Represented by his Deputy, Mr Charles Iliya, the Governor advised youths to eschew religious, ethnic, or political violence violence to enable the country achieve Sustainable Unity and Development. After a successful election of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, NYCN, in 2008, in Abuja, the Council became fictionalized when another election was to hold in 2011, in Kwara State. All attempts to organise election, including interventions of past Ministers of Youths and Sports, proved abortive until the present Minister, Barr Slomon Dalung involved all the aggrieved parties insisting that an election must hold. Consequently, a national transition committee was set up last year and its tenure extended for six months to accommodate more aggrieved parties, which led to the Unity Congress in Gombe State. He added that youths must live up to the expectation of being agents of positive change. The Board of Trustees Chairman of NYCN, Dr Dickson Akoh advised the delegates to carefully elect young people that would ensure stability in the council and attract international collaborations. Represented by the Director. education and youth development, Mrs Bakari Girie, the Minister, said youths must strive to take their rightful position in the society.
