The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has said a study conducted in some Northern states in Nigeria has shown that over 50 per cent of girls who attended primary schools are not able to transit to secondary schools. UNICEF’s Education Specialist, Azuka Menkiti disclosed this during a Two Day Media Dialogue organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture in collaboration with UNICEF in Zamfara State. She said it was discovered that there was high dropout rate of girls from schools between primary four to six, and that the inability of many continuing to secondary school prompted the Girl for Girl (G4G) initiative. “In the months following the inception of this programme, a lot of positive changes have been seen in the girls who now aspire to become great women in future,” she said. She disclosed that the implementation of the programme, which commenced in 2017, has encouraged the enrolment of about 15,303 girls in Zamfara, Bauchi and Katsina. The Executive Director of Life Helpers Initiative in Zamfara state, Mr Tayo Fatinikun, said Zamfara is one of the educationally disadvantaged Northern states with very poor and low enrolment, retention level and the strong disparity between boys and girls enrolment. He said with G4G initiative, there have been results of greater interest in education and exposure of the girls to an enhanced learning attitude and life skills. He noted that through the mentors and mother associations, the girls were trained on social, vocational and health-based issues through school-based safe space, extra curriculum activities established in support of the enrolled girls in benefiting areas.
