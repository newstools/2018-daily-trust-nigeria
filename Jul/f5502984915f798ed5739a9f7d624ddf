Katsina Emirate Council under the leadership of the Emir of Katsina Abdulmumini Kabir Usman has appointed Sen. Ibrahim Ida as the new Sardaunan Katsina.

Ida's appointment followed the death of late Ibrahim Coomassie who held the tittle before his demise last week Thursday.

The secretary of the emirate and Sallama Katsina, Bello Ifo confirmed the development in a statement made available to Daily Trust in Katsina.

Until his appointment, Ida was the Dan Majen Katsina.
