Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has vowed that his government will bring perpetrators of the recent violence in ‎some parts of the state to book. The governor spoke yesterday while receiving the Deputy Chief of Mission in the United States Embassy Abuja, Mr. David Young. Lalong thanked the United States Embassy in Nigeria for collaborating with the state’s Peace Building Agency in holding a stakeholders’ parley in the troubled zone. Young said those behind the killings must be made to face the wrath of the law. He said the U.S Embassy would continue to partner with the Plateau State government.
