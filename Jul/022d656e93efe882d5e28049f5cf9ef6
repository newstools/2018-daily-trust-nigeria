The Founder and General Overseer of the Redeemed Evangelical Mission (Tregem), Prophetess Monisola Faseyi has warned church leaders on the judgement of God if they fail to repent from their iniquities. In a message that titled ‘The Midnight Message’ which she delivered in her church auditorium yesterday at Isinigbo in Akure, Ondo State, Prophetess Faseyi said God will not be happy with most church leaders and general overseers that have departed from His ways. She said God is displeased with some shepherds that have submitted to the fame, wealth and vain things of this world, saying “Where are the redeemed of the world amongst leaders of the church”. She reminded all church leaders that they would return to God to give account of their deeds and likewise admonished them to do the needful before it became too late.
