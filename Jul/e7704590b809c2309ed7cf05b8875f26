The chairman of the FCT wing of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Comrade Stephen Knabayi, has met with the leadership of the FCT chapter of the  Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) over non-payment of and implementation of primary school teachers promotion across the six area councils. Knabayi, while speaking when he led some executives of the union to meet with the chairman of the FCT ALGON, Joseph K. Shazin, in Kwali on Friday, said teachers under the Local Education Authority (LEA) from the six area councils were yet to receive their promotion arrears across the councils. He added that upgrading of teachers with higher qualification as well as implementation of teachers professional allowance were all not taken care of by the council authorities. He explained that the 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017, promotion arrears of five months and annual increment for four months and six months, respectively, among other entitlements for teachers of Bwari Area Council, have also not been paid by the present administration of the council. He said Gwagwalada Area Council was also yet to clear the teachers’ 2013 promotion arrears of seven months, adding that the 2018 annual increment arrears of January and February were also pending. Knabayi, further noted that there was also the 2017 annual increment arrears of 10 months - January to October - for the teachers of AMAC, which he said had not been cleared by the council authorities. He added that the 2015 teachers promotion arrears of three months for grade level 07 to 13 and promotion arrears of eight months for grade level 14 and 16 as well as 15 were also not implemented by the council. “It would also interest the ALGON to note that there are other annual increment arrears from 2012, 2013, 2014,2015, 2017 for our teachers in Rubochi which are also yet to be implemented, while Kwali Area Council teachers are also yet to get their promotion arrears of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017  and 2018 as well as 40 percent rent allowance,” he said. Responding, the FCT ALGON chairman, Mr. Joseph K. Shazin, said teachers welfare was a priority for the association. Shazin, assured the union executives that he would discussed the issue with his colleagues at their meeting. “But I will also suggest that you table this matter before the education secretary  and the FCT permanent secretary so that they will present it at our JAAC meeting,” he said.
