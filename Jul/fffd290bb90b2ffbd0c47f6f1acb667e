The anti-corruption commission in Sierra Leone says that former Vice-President Victor Foh and former Mines Minister Minkailu Mansaray have been arrested on charges of corruption. The arrests come a day after another commission appointed by President Julius Maada Bio concluded that corruption was rampant under the government of his predecessor, Ernest Koroma. On Wednesday, President Bio declared on television that corruption was serious enough to destroy Sierra Leone. The ex-president’s APC party has dismissed yesterday’s report as politically-motivated.
