A Lagos Special Offences Court sitting at Ikeja yesterday ordered the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to produce the chairman of Innosson Motors Limited, Innocent Chukwuma in court. Justice Olusola Williams said the order was necessary due to the absence of the Chairman of Innoson Motors Nigeria Ltd, who was scheduled to be arraigned before her over forgery charge against him by the EFCC. The judge said: â€œI believe it is the job of the prosecution to bring the defendant to court because they are the Executives. The judge thereafter adjourned the matter till October 10, 2018, for arraignment. Chukwuma and his company, Innoson Motors Nigeria Ltd., were to be arraigned on a four-count charge of conspiracy to obtain property by false pretences, obtaining property by false pretences, stealing and forgery in a transaction with Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB). According to the charge sheet, the defendants committed the offences between 2009 and July 2011 in Lagos.
