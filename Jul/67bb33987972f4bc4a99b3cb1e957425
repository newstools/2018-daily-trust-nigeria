A Brazilian judge has ordered the release of ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (known as “Lula”). The judge said the left-wing politician must be released from prison in Curitiba while an appeal process is carried out. In April, Lula was sentenced to 12 years and one month in prison for corruption and money laundering. He has always declared his innocence, saying the conviction was politically motivated. Polls conducted before he was jailed in April suggested that Lula was the frontrunner for the presidential elections, which will be held in October. The 72-year-old was jailed after a close vote, with six Supreme Court justices in favour of jailing him and five against.
