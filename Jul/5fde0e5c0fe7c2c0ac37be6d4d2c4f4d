Health officials from nine African countries are meeting in Nigeria to consider scaling up use of chlorhexidine gel in umbilical cord care for newborns in efforts to prevent deaths from infections. The gel was introduced in Nigeria for umbilical cord care since 2012 and has since been written into the Essential Medicines List and given n over-the-counter status, making it available for purchase.  But its uptake falls short of the target 52 per cent coverage, despite the manufacture of chlorhexidine gel by four Nigerian drugmakers .   The gel is recommended for standard cord care across West African countries but officials representing individual nations at the meeting in Abuja say cost and availability hinder its uptake.  Alcohol is still used for cord care in Burkina Faso and Togo. Use of chlorhexidine remains below target in Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Mali and Niger. A few of the countries are considering sourcing supply of the gel from Nigerian drugmakers, four of which have gotten WHO pre-qualification to make chlorhexidine gel.  At least 37 out of every 1,000 newborns die each year before they are 28 days old, the highest world over. Equally high death rates among newborns is recorded across countries in the West African subregion attending the meeting.  One in four of the deaths is due to preventable infections, which could have been avoided through proper care of the umbilical cord, experts from the Maternal and Child Survival Programme say. Abdullahi Mashi, permanent secretary at Federal Ministry of Health, told the meeting weak logistics for maternal, newborn and child health hampered implementation of chlorhexidine use.   In addition, poor data management for making decision to improve chlorhexidine use across ECOWAS subregion.
