Three main socio-cultural organizations in Benue State on Thursday applauded Governor Samuel Ortom for his determination to ensure the implementation and enforcement of the state's anti-open grazing law.  Daily Trust reports that the leaders of the ethnic groups under the umbrella of the Mdzough U Tiv (MUT), Idoma National Forum (INF), and Omi Ny’Igede (ONI) also hailed the troops of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS) for stemming the tide of killings in the state while they commiserated with families of the personnel who had lost their lives in the operation.  In a statement made available to our correspondent in Makurdi by Engr Edward Ujege on behalf of the chairmen of the three bodies, the organizations passed a vote of confidence on Ortom for his resilience to ensure that the will of the people of the state prevailed in the face of adversity.  "The forum of MUT, INF and ONI are therefore deeply appreciative of Governor Samuel Ortom for consistently and firmly staking his neck to entrenching modern way of animal husbandry through the enactment of the law on ranching,” Ujege stated.  It added that the success of the governor efforts will encourage and guarantee mass participation in agricultural activities which is the main economic stay of Benue people apart from the civil service, stressing that, in the face of apparent persecution and lackluster response from the centre, which ought to provide the citizens security, Ortom had chosen to stand with his people who are also standing with him  The statement emphasized that, “Benue State of Nigeria is ours as we have nowhere else to call home hence we appreciate the excellent work commenced by the military under the operation "Whirl Stroke" for maintaining the peace and commencing the return of some IDPs to their ancestral homes. Your sacrifice will not be in vain."
