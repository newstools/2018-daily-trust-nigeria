Authorities said 38 people were killed and 37 others wounded in a seriesÂ of bombings and attacks in the southern province of Sweida on Wednesday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said suicide bombers from the Islamic State (IS) detonated bomb vests and explosive devices in Sweida city in tandem with an attack by this terror-designated group on towns in the eastern countryside of Sweida on Wednesday. Three suicide bombers set off their bomb vests near the grocery market and the roundabouts of Mashnaqa and Najmeh in Sweida city, the Observatory said, adding that explosive devices were detonated in the same areas. In the northeastern countryside of Sweida, where the Syrian warplanes are taking part in striking the IS fighters, the militants launched attacks on several towns amid confrontation between the Syrian
army and the militants. Meanwhile, a medical source inside the city confirmed to Xinhua that over 30 people were killed in the attacks, adding that the wounded are being taken to the national hospital in the city. Syrian state news agency SANA said a suicide bomber detonated himself while the two others were killed before setting their explosives off in the city. It added that another explosion took place in the Maslakh area in the city.
