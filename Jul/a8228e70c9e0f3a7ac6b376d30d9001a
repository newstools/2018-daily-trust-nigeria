A former commissioner in Bayelsa State and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC),  Chief Lionel Jonthan-Omo, died yesterday from serious injuries after earlier falling from a one-storey building. Chief Jonathan-Omo, who was also a state delegate at the 2005 National Political Reform Conference (NPRC) was during the last  gubernatorial election in the state, the deputy Director-General of the Sylva/Igiri governorship campaign organisation. The APC in Bayelsa State described his death as the indescribable loss of a wonderful ally at a time his experience and energy were most needed. According to a statement from the party’s  Publicity Secretary in the state, Mr. Doifie Buokoribo, Jonathan-Omo broke his limbs in a fall and fought bravely for his life at a private hospital in Port Harcourt but did not survive. He  died after an unsuccessful operation. Jonathan-Omo was described as a forthright politician and an illustrious son of Bayelsa State and the Ijaw nation who partook in popular activities to better the lives of his people. “All of us had hoped that Jonathan-Omo would recover from his injuries and get on with his life, particularly at this time of intense political activities in our state and country when his experience and wisdom are seriously needed.”
