The Board of Trustees (BoT) of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has cautioned the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government against destabilising today’s governorship election in Ekiti State. The chairman of the board, Senator Walid Jibrin, told newsmen in Abuja yesterday that the deployment of over 30,000 security personnel for the election was disturbing. Jibrin urged security agencies not to allow Ekiti State to become a battleground that would lead to crisis. “30,000 policemen and other security agencies totaling up to 50,000 should be judiciously utilized to protect the people of Ekiti, protect their votes, lives and property. They should not allow any bloodshed,” he said.
