The House of Representatives has mandated its Committee on Interior to investigate the N2.8 billion appropriated for the Federal Fire Service of Nigeria in the 2011 budget but not utilized. The resolution followed a motion on notice by Ayoola Abayomi (APC, Lagos) on the need to probe the whereabouts of the fund, the effect of which has left the Federal Fire Service with poor, obsolete equipment, and unable to respond to its current challenges. “In 2011, the sum of N2.8 billion was appropriated for the Federal Fire Service to purchase trucks and equipment but till date, there is nothing to show for it, hence the need to probe the whereabouts of that money,” Abayomi stated. Abayomi, in the lead debate, recalled that there had been several fire disasters in recent times, notably that of the Ogbete Market in Enugu and Sabon Gari Market in Kano, where over 3,800 shops were razed by fire. After deliberations, the lawmakers unanimously adopted the motion.
