The management of Waziri Umaru Federal Polytechnic Staff Academic Secondary School in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State are in dilemma over the pregnancy of an SS3 student as five male teachers separately confessed to having sexual affairs with her. The five teachers - Abdullahi Nura,  Muktar, Aminu, Musa, Jafar and one yet to be identified male student - were sacked after they confessed to the school authorities that they had been separately having sexual affairs with the student whose name was given simply as Sa’adatu. The school management had last week set up a committee to investigate the student’s pregnancy when she could not identify who was responsible for it among the five teachers that have had affairs with her. A teacher in the school, who pleaded anonymity because he was not authorised to speak, said “When the committee interrogated the teachers, they all confessed to having sexual affairs with the student separately. They were sacked on the committee’s recommendations.” When our correspondent visited the school, the Principal Mallam Muhammed Musa Mahuta was said be on admission in hospital weeks before the incident happened. However, the Vice Principal Mallam Oumar Bankano Woulandakoye confirmed the incident. He said the teachers involved had appealed against their dismissal by the School Management Board. “I just received a memo now from the school management that they are going to sit on the matter tomorrow. May be you can come back by Friday to get the details, “he said.
