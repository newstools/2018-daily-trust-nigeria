The Federal Government has begun the process of industrializing and commercializing the production of textiles, groundnuts and other products. The first step is the establishment of Kano Zonal Office for the Implementation of the Nigeria Agribusiness and Agro-Industry Development Initiative (NAADI). Speaking at the flag-off and official commissioning of Kano Zonal Office for the implementation of the initiative, Hajiya Aisha Abubakar, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment, Edet Akpan, said the initiative would focus on textiles and garments, hides and skin, livestock, fisheries, rice, sesame, groundnuts, tomato and pepper in Kano State. The minister expressed optimism that the implementation of the NAADI will bring about sustained poverty reduction, human capital development and prosperity to the majority of Nigerians. She further stated that NAADI would facilitate the achievement of productive and profitable value chains as well as greater Agribusiness participation in domestic and international markets. Hajiya Aisha bemoaned the nation’s dependence on the importation of manufactured products which over the years run into several billions of dollars annually. The minister said the trend has affected “the required value-chain linkage between agriculture and industry which has not allowed us to move our agricultural products to industrial level for the final production of finished goods, products and equipment.” Hajiya Aisha disclosed that NAADI Coordinating Offices have been established in Akure, Bauchi, Uyo, Owerri, Sokoto and Kano.
