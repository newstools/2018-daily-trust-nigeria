The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has freed seven inmates from the Kuje Prison in Abuja. The freed inmates were part of those unable to pay their fines as ordered by the court. A statement by the Director, Corporate Affairs department of the commission, Mr Lambart Okpara, said the Executive Secretary of the Commission, Tony Ojukwu paid the fines for the seven prisoners during the flag off ceremony of the 2018 audit of prisons and other detention centres in Nigeria. The statement said Ojukwu admonished the freed prisoners to be of good behaviour and avoid acts that would take them back to prison. Ojukwu said the audit was a mandate driven project routinely carried out by the commission in pursuant to its powers as provided in Section 6(d) of the NHRC Amendment Act, 2010.
