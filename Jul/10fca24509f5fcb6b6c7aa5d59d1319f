The Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Alhaji Yusuf Abdullahi Ata has said that the recent defection of Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from All Progressive Congress (APC) is long overdue.

Speaking to Daily Trust exclusively, Honorable Ata also assured the defection would not in any way affect the ruling APC and victory of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in 2019 general elections.
