The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the reappointment of Professor Eli Jidere Bala as the Director General, Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN). NYCN President, Comrade Muratala Garba spoke to journalists in Abuja against the backdrop of the protest against the reappointment of Bala after 5 years of service. Garba described Professor Bala as an incorruptible person that has done a lot in the commission. “In terms of corruption, Professor Bala, right from his days at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria till now, is well known as a transparent and accountable person.” “If there is anything they have recorded of his financial misconduct, they should go to the Economic Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) and other agencies for proper action. Not to take law into their hands. "Under his watch, the commission's debt on constituency projects was reduced to N6.5billion from N16billion in 2013. He also ensured that all projects were fully executed without incurring new debts,” Garba said. The youth leader urged the unionists at the commission to dialogue with their boss for way out of the unnecessary confrontation. “We however call on the DG Energy Commission to also improve on the welfare of his staff, this is important for maximum output from the staff,” he said.
