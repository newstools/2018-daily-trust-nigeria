The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Water Resources, Dr Musa Ibrahim, disclosed this in Abuja yesterday during a meeting with delegation of the Nasarawa state government led by the state Commissioner of Water Resources and Rural Development, Ortan Gabriel Akaaka. Daily Trust reports that the meeting was held preparatory to the takeover of the dam, located in Wamba Local Government Area of the state.
