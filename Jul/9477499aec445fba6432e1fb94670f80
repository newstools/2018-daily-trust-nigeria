Federal lawmakers from Plateau State have clashed over the allegations by one of them that 300 people from the state were trained on how to kill people in faraway Israel. Rep Ahmed Idris Wase last Tuesday told the House during a debate on the recent killings of over 200 people in some parts of the state that some politicians were behind the killings. The lawmaker had said that: “I was opportuned to be a member of the transition committee when this government came to power in Plateau State. I want to say this, that the security are not doing their work. They’re the causes of this matter, whether we like it or not. “Mr Speaker, I want to inform this House and Nigerians that about 300 people were trained in Israel, I say 300 people. It’s there in our report; we gave it to government to work on it, to find out who were sent for that training. I can tell you Mr Speaker, to date, nobody has been traced. “I want to tell you sir. There’s a company in Nigeria, today in Plateau State, that’s working. They did importation of about four trailers, but four containers were missing. When we traced as a committee on what were in those containers, to God who made me sir, we were told they were taken to a person’s house, a high politician. I’ll give you the name of the company; it’s a security firm in Israel,” he said. However, other lawmakers from the state including Senators Jonah Jang and Jerry Husseini as well as Reps Gyang Pwajok, Johnbull Shekarau, Timothy Golu, Solomon Maren, among others said Wase was economical with the truth. They wondered why he kept the information to himself for the past three years, saying he was only trying to add more salt to injury. They said during a press conference in Abuja that the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ibrahim Idris should not waste time to investigate Wase over the state. Our correspondent gathered that the differing positions taken by both Wase and the other lawmakers were already causing bad blood among the Plateau lawmakers.
