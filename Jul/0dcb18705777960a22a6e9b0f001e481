A former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday warned African leaders against youth anger across the continent, especially in countries with weak job-creation programmes and bad governance. Obasanjo, who spoke at the Annual General Meeting and 25th anniversary of the African Export-Import (AFREXIM) Bank in Abuja, said he was deeply worried about developments in some African countries, particularly among frustrated youths. “I get a bit worried because whatever we may be thinking about our problems, one problem that can consume all of us, because it has no religious or territorial boundaries or ethnic boundary is the youth anger, frustration going into a big explosion in many of our countries on the continent,” he said. He said 50 per cent of the population of youths is not educated, trained and given skills to help themselves and such society cannot make the needed progress. Obasanjo noted that leaders must be realistic and aware of innovations and new technology around them.
