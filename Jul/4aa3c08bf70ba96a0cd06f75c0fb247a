Some members of the House of Representatives, under the auspices of Parliamentary Democrats Group (PDG) have cautioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) to avoid intimidating Speaker Yakubu Dogara over his plans to dump the party. Spokesman of the group, Timothy Golu (PDP, Plateau) who presented the lawmakers’ position after a meeting in Abuja yesterday, described “APC’s desperate attempt to keep Dogara in the party” as “sheer waste of time.” The group said, Dogara reserves the right to defect to any political party of his choice without fear of impeachment as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, saying APC has no right to sack him from the position. “It is laughable that the APC is begging the Speaker to remain in a party that has failed. Whereas the APC worked against his emergence, other members who saw his nationalistic spirit voted for him. “He is the speaker of the House of Representatives, not of the APC,” Golu said. The group wondered why APC wants to retain the Speaker’s position after humiliating Dogara and his associates from the ward congress of the party in Bauchi State. It accused the Adams Oshiomhole-led APC of ‘impunity and undemocratic conduct,’ saying lawmakers were solidly behind the Speaker and would ensure that he retained his position even after defection.
