Nigeria striker Ahmed Musa has been linked with a move away from Leicester City for a staggering £40m fee.

The Nigeria striker was an impressive performer at the World Cup, but he appears to have little future at the King Power Stadium having spent the second half of last season on loan at CSKA Moscow.

Multiple international outlets are now saying Musa will move to Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr for a fee which would represent fantastic business for the Foxes.

He hit match-winning double against Iceland, but City would still have a battle to recoup the £16 million they paid CSKA for his services two years ago.

Musa, who has been linked with numerous clubs including Galatasaray, has made just four appearances in total for City since the sacking of Claudio Ranieri in February, 2017.
