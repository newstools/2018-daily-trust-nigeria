The South East Governors Forum (SEGF) will meet federal security chiefs, leadership of farmers and herdsmen over the increased movement of herdsmen in the south east zone to prevent possible clashes. Chairman of the forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Eng Dave Umahi, said this while addressing journalists after the meeting of the governors held at the Enugu State Government House. The meeting was attended by Governors Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Dave Umahi (Ebonyi), while Abia and Anambra states were represented by the deputy governors. Imo State Governor Chief Rochas Okorocha did not attend and did not send a representative. The governors said they had noticed “increased challenges in the movement of herdsmen from one state and region to another with resultant effect of massive destruction of farmland with attendant clashes with farmers.” Umahi reiterated the governors’ position that “We don’t have enough land for the people let alone for ranching.” On restructuring, Umahi said the Igbo position on the matter was presented to SEGF by the Ohanaeze President, Chief Nnia Nwodo, based on the resolutions arising from the Awka enlarged Igbo meeting, adding that Nwodo also laid down the template to the governors. Umahi said the governors would study the template of restructuring and make its final stand clear at their next meeting. The governors also commiserated with the governor of Plateau State and the people for the recent killings in the state and joined other regions to demand justice for the Plateau people. The meeting was also attended by some traditional rulers in the zone including the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe.
