The police in Benue State have dispelled rumour making the rounds that a segment of the Makurdi-Abuja highway had been blocked by unknown persons who are hacking travellers to death. In a statement by the Benue Police Command Public Relation Officer (PPRO), DSP Moses Joel Yamu, the police urged the general public to disregard the lies as there was no part or segment of Makurdi-Abuja highway blocked by anyone. “No killing or any act of banditry, attack is taking place on any segment of the road as being falsely circulated online,” the statement reads in part. It added that the police from Benue and Nasarawa, as well as troops of the Joint Security Forces (Operation Whirl Stroke) have been on confidence building patrol on the highway, as proactive measures to prevent any untoward incident, stressing that the initiative will be sustained. The statement advised members of the public to report any suspicious movement or person to the security agencies.
