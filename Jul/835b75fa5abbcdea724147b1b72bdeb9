Niger State House of Assembly has rejected the request by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello seeking approval to access N21.5bn Sukuk bond for infrastructural development. The House passed the resolution stopping the request Tuesday following the presentation of the report of its special committee on it. Presenting the report, chairman of the committee, Alhaji Abdulmalik Kabir (APC, Paikoro) said the committee reached its conclusion after serious interface with relevant stakeholders on the desirability of accessing the bond. He said the committee was particularly disturbed by the high cost of transaction which stands at over N10bn, in addition to the actual value of the bond itself, adding that such obligation would be too much for the state to bear at this material time. “The total amount of the charges, fees and profit that would be paid shall amount to N10.365bn at the end of the seven year tenor in addition to the N21.5bn principal. “We discovered that charges such as management fees, professional fees, contingency fees, cost of underwriting amounting to N9bn only inclusive of the 17 percent profit is considered to be too much on the higher side. “Again, we found that most of the bill of quantity for the projects is over-priced”, he added. He said if approval was granted, N255m would be the monthly deduction for repayment of the Bond, bringing the monthly deduction from FAAC allocation to N1.05 billion. He said with such scenario, the state would not be able to meet the salary obligation to its workers much less providing the dividends of democracy to its teeming masses.
