Hundreds of red caps, symbols of the Kwankwasiyya Movement of former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabi’u Kwankwaso was set ablaze in Jigawa State. This followed the defection of the senator from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking to Daily Trust on Sunday at the site of burning of the caps in Dutse, the former chairman of the movement in the state, Ibrahim Kwaciri, said the exercise took place simultaneously in the 27 local government areas of the state. He added that prior to the defection of Senator Kwankwaso, the movement had about 1 million supporters but many had withdrawn their membership. When Daily Trust on Sunday visited the secretariat of the movement, the red colour of the movement on the building was being changed.
