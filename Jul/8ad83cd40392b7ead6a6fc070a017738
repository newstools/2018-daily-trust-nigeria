US President Donald Trump has lashed out at “haters” who condemned his meeting with Russia’s president. On Twitter, Mr Trump said his critics were suffering from “Trump Derangement Syndrome”. The broadside came a day after he said he misspoke during Monday’s Helsinki summit when he appeared to side with Vladimir Putin over claims of Kremlin meddling in US elections. Despite the controversy, Republican voters still seem to support Mr Trump. Responding on Twitter on Wednesday morning, the Republican president said his critics would “rather go to war” and “wanted to see a boxing match” between him and Mr Putin. During a cabinet meeting later in the day, one journalist asked Mr Trump if Russia was still targeting the US. He answered: “Thank you very much, no.”
