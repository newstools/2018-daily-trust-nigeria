The family of former National Security Adviser (NSA) Sambo Dasuki has petitioned the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) over comments by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Malam Abubakar Malami (SAN). The family are accusing the AGF of professional misconduct and promoting disobedience to the lawful order of court by the Federal Government. The petition dated July 23, 2018 was signed by Dasuki’s wife, Hajia Bintu Sambo Dasuki; his son, Abubakar Atiku Dasuki and his nephew, Senator Umar Dahiru. The family requested NBA to probe Malami for allegedly making “an unprofessional statement to denigrate the court, violate the Constitution and encourage the continued breach of the fundamental human rights of Dasuki, who has been clamped into detention since December 29, 2015.” Malami was on July 19 quoted to have told the BBC that based on public interest, and the death of 100, 000 persons in the Boko Haram insurgency, the Federal Government will not release Dasuki as ordered by courts, the latest by an Abuja Federal High Court on July 2. The Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the AGF, Salihu Othman Isah said NBA should be allowed to look into the petition, adding that he was sure the AGF would be given fair hearing.
