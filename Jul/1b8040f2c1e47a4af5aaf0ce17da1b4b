The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) on Saturday apologised to its customers in Ibeju communities in Lagos over the continuous epileptic power supply being experienced in the area. Mr Godwin Idemudia, the General Manager, Corporate Communications, EKEDC said in a statement in Lagos that the situation was due to overloading of the feeder and incessant faults. “We are alternating supply between Ogombo Town, Abraham Adesanya Estate and Lekki Scheme 1, one day off and two days on, respectively. “This load shedding will continue until the problem is fully rectified. “We thank our customers for their patience and regret any inconveniences caused by the irregular supply,’’ he said.
