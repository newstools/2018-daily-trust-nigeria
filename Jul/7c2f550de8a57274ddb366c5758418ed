Some officials at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) will face sanction when the truth on the exemption certificate saga involving Minister of Finance Kemi Adeosun is unravelled. An official at the Corps, who spoke to Daily Trust off record yesterday, said the agency has commenced inquiry into the saga and will soon come out with a position. The source said “Although we are still searching the systems and inviting various people to explain what must have happened but we are worried and confused. “Bomoi (a late former DG of NYSC) left in 2009 January, how come his signature is showing in September 2009 certificate, which is not supposed to be so. It is totally illegal and that alone shows that something is wrong somewhere. “What is worrisome is how the certificate must have gotten to her. She alone can tell how she got the certificate. We are really praying and hoping she talks but definitely many people will go down if she talks. “Part of the crime is why anyone should give her an exemption certificate when the person knows she graduated at a young age so she was supposed to be told to go and serve. “The pressure is on us from the Nigerian society as everyone is waiting on us to produce the evidence that she served or not,” the source, who asked for anonymity said. Daily Trust attempt at getting narrative from a former NYSC boss, Maharazu Tsiga proved abortive yesterday as he did not call our reporter back as promised.
