The Ona of Abaji and Chairman of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has tasked the management of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) to improve power supply in the area. The Ona, who made the call when he paid a courtesy call on the Managing Director/CEO of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), Engineer. Ernest Mupwaya, on Thursday, sought for collaboration between the company and his community to address incessant cases of poor power supply in his chiefdom. The traditional ruler also requested for the provision of prepaid meters to customers in Abaji, and implored the firm to consider using local dialects to engage with customers to enhance service delivery. Responding, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of AEDC said the company will engage a contractor to commence a holistic review of the lines serving Abaji, with effect from July 16, 2018. He also informed the traditional ruler that AEDC would make recommendations on steps to improve distribution of power in the area. Engr. Mupwaya also disclosed that plans are under way to collaborate with a solar power company that intends to establish a plant which, he said, would augment the quantum of electricity being distributed to Abaji through the national power grid. In line with the planned solar power project, the AEDC boss requested for land from the monarch, to which the Ona of Abaji granted approval without delay.
