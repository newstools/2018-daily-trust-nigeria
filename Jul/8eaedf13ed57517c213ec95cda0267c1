President Muhammadu Buhari has declined assent to four bills, citing various reasons. Buhari conveyed his decision in four separate letters read at yesterday plenary session by Senate President Bukola Saraki. The four bills are; the National Child Protection and Enforcement Agency (NCPEA) Bill; the Agriculture Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (amendment) bill; the Corporate Manslaughter Bill, and the Courts and Tribunals (Standard Scale of Fine) Bill. On the NCPEA Bill, the president said all the proposed duties and responsibilities of the agency are currently the statutory responsibilities of the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and that it would lead to duplicate of mandates of MDAs, which would result in waste. Buhari said his decision to decline assent to the Agriculture Scheme Fund Bill was due to the fact that the increase in the size to N50 billion would not be effective as drafted because the introductory language in Section 5 (1) of the principal Act, which sets out the size of the fund retains the original fund size of N100 million. He said he was ready to sign the bill once the drafting was rectified. Also, the President said Section 1 (5) of the manslaughter bill imposes a fine upon mere indictment of a corporate organisation, which he said appeared to be inconsistent with Section 36 (5) of the Constitution, which enshrines presumption of innocence until proven otherwise. On the courts and tribunals bill, he said the proposed standard scale of fines appears to be ambiguous as it does not clearly state the manner by which any given offence will fall under a particular level on the scale. He said the proposed scale of fines may conflict with existing penalties and fines under extant Nigerian laws, which already impose penalties and fines for various offences.
