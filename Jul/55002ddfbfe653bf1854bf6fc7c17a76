The Chief Medical Director of the Yariman Bakura Specialist Hospital, Zamfara State, Dr Bello Muhammad Kotorkoshi, yesterday attributed medical brain drain in the country to insecurity and lack of conducive work environment. He spoke ahead of the 5th Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference with a theme “ Safe Medical Practice in a Security Challenged Environment” organised by the state chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA). He said no fewer than 20 doctors had left his hospital since January. “It is not only the employment of doctors in our hospitals that matters but providing them with conducive environment, right structures and equipment is also very important,” he said.
