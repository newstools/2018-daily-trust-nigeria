South Africa’s former president Jacob Zuma arrived at the  Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday for his third appearance on  corruption charges relating to a $2.5 billion arms deal in the late  1990s. Zuma, who was ousted by the ruling party in February, faces 16  charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal  to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa’s armed forces  after the end of apartheid in 1994. The case is a rare example of an African leader being held to account for his actions. Zuma denies any wrongdoing. State prosecutors and Zuma’s lawyers are expected to argue over a  start date for the trial. Dressed in a dark suit and red tie, the former  president was seen in court shaking hands with his supporters before  sitting down. Dozens of his supporters held an overnight vigil in the city and  hundreds marched to court through the streets of Pietermaritzburg, the  capital and second-largest city in the KwaZulu-Natal province, chanting  support for Zuma. Some said the former president, whose nine years in power were marked  by economic stagnation and credit rating downgrades, is the victim of a  politically motivated witch-hunt. They carried placards emblazoned with the words: “100% behind H.E. Zuma” and “Solid ANC Leader”. The speed with which prosecutors have moved against Zuma is a sign of  his waning influence since he was replaced as head of state by Cyril  Ramaphosa, his former deputy, four months ago. Ramaphosa has made the fight against corruption a top priority as he  seeks to woo foreign investment and revamp an ailing economy.  (Reuters/NAN)
