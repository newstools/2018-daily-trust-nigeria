Olumawu School Abuja has celebrated its 25th year of academic excellence even as it graduated 36 secondary  school students. Speaking at the occasion held in Abuja, Saturday, the school’s proprietress, Mrs Olanipekun Christiana, applauded the founder of the school for her contribution to the development of education in the country. “Mrs Margaret Oloruntomiwo Audu stood for discipline and up-to-date development in the field of education. I am glad that our standard has kept on improving on daily basis with the help of the governing council which has not relented in moving the school forward by providing all that is necessary to keep the high standard we inherited from the founder,” she said. The principal of the school, Dr Felicia Jackson, said students from the school emerged first and second among their peers at local and national competitions. She said the students conducted on-site community services at hospital, displacement centres and orphanages. The school’s former head girl, Udeosen Idara, said her position has given her a different point of view of leadership. She said, “It has taught me that not only do leaders lead by example and guide people to do the right thing, they also work with their followers to ensure all-round development and the attainment of their goals and aspirations.” She urged the school to focus more on the interests and abilities of students when they are admitted into the senior secondary school to efficient choices of their courses of study when going to tertiary institutions.
