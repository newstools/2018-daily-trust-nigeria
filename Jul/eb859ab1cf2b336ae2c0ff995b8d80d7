Ekiti state Governor Ayodele Fayose, on Tuesday openly confronted security chiefs in the state, Mr. Ahmed Bello and Mrs. Promise Ihenacho, Commissioner of Police and the Director of the Department of State Services (DSS), respectively over what he called deployment of compromised operatives to the state to allegedly perpetrate rigging and illegal arrests. But stakeholders such as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security re-assured that the election slated for July 14 will be free, fair and devoid of any form of malpractices that could mar the process. The atmosphere of the Afe Babalola Civic Centre, Ado Ekiti, where the event was held became charged, as party members inside the hall rained unprintable words on the DSS boss as she made efforts to respond to the allegations. Fayose alleged that ex-Chief Security Officer (CSO) to Dr Kayode Fayemi, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress(APC), Hakeem Abiola and his former Aide De' Camp (ADC), Adeyemi Ajayi , were  already in the state  to lead policemen to conduct illegal arrest of members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and harass innocent electorate. The DSS boss, Mrs Ihenacho, while confirming the presence of the former Fayemi’s CSO in Ekiti, denied leading a unit as alleged by the governor. This further provoked the audience and made them to become uncontrollable until Fayose intervened and brought the situation under control. Under the charged atmosphere, the CP quickly intervened, saying any police officer that has political affinity with any of the interested parties would not be used for the election. The CP added,  “I have built a career going to 35 years in the police and I won’t want anybody to bring me down, not even any politician or even your Excellency, Dr. Fayose will ask me to rig election and I will comply.
