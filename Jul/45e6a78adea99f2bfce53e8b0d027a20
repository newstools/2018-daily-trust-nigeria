The chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, yesterday hosted the FCT women of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in his office. Ajiya said his administration had ensured peaceful coexistence among residents of the council irrespective of religious, ethnic or political affiliations. He informed the delegation that to show love and oneness among Christians and Muslims, he joined the Christians in church during last year’s Christmas celebration. “It may interest you to know that during the December Christmas celebration, I joined our Christian brothers at their churches to show them love and oneness. And the CAN youth wing in Abaji here can testify to that,” he said. The chairman appreciated the CAN women wing for their visit, saying his administration would continue to provide necessary assistance whenever the need arose. Earlier, the FCT chairperson of CAN, Deaconess Bola Ihesiulor, said the delegation paid the visit to appreciate the chairman for his efforts in ensuring peaceful coexistence among the people of the council irrespective of religious background.
