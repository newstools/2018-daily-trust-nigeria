The Transparency Advocacy for Development Initiative (TADI) has condemned alleged plans by the Association of Senior Civil Servants (ASCSN) Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) unit to sabotage gains recorded by the Federal Government in energy efficiency in the country. The Executive Director of the initiative, Yomi David, at a news conference in Abuja urged the union to refrain from further attempts at ‘arm-twisting’ the federal government and should also direct its members to return to duty immediately. He said “It is clear that the ASCSN-ECN Unit has pitched itself against President Muhammadu Buhari by questioning his well advised decision to reappoint Prof Bala Jidere for another term as Director General of Energy Commission of Nigeria. “The ASCSN should abide by President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to reappoint Prof Jidere as this decision was well thought and subjected to the thorough scrutiny of all security and anti-graft agencies.”
