An aspirant for the AMAC/Bwari Federal constituency House of Representatives seat, Prince David Adeyeye, has pledged to lobby for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Mayoral Status bill. Prince Adeyeye gave the pledge in Abuja on Saturday when he declared to run for the seat on the platform of Young Progressive Party (YPP) in the 2019 National Assembly election. The aspirant, who highlighted his legislative agenda for community development if elected, advised FCT residents to disregard the seed of division of indigenes versus non-indigenes that had robbed them of qualitative representation. He further promised to push for FCT Public Health bill,  and work with the FCDA on Rent to Own (RtO) housing scheme and other public private partnership housing schemes. Prince Adeyeye, who stressed his readiness to pursue responsive social infrastructure within communities, vowed to lobby for the establishment of more primary and secondary schools in the rural communities. He underscored his commitment to accelerated electrification in the hinterland and improved transportation system as well as a functional public health system. “We must see beyond party politics and rise up to the challenges of nationhood. We must stop being subservient to the political godfathers and their dirty money politics. We must take our fate in our hands to save our generation from slavery and incompetent leadership,” he also said.
