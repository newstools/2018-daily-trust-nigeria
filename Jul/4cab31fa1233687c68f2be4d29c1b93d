The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has cautioned journalists against biased political reporting in the country. “We wish to caution against overlapping of media and polities and to encourage media professionals to give fair coverage and equitable access to opposition parties.”  The umbrella body of Nigerian journalists also “condemn any disproportionate coverage of political activities based on economic considerations or political bias.”  A statement by the national secretary of the union, Shuaibu Leman described the coverage by journalists  as exemplary “despite the many limitations to Journalistic excellence like poor remuneration for media professionals and journalists.”  The NUJ scribe said “Journalists are essential to democracy and to development generally and it is worth noting that a democratic election is impossible without them.  “We are happy therefore that Nigerian journalists  had ensured appropriate media behavior during the coverage of Ekiti Election.”
