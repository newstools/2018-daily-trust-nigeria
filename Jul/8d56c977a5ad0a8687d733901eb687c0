There has been a surge in the number of Muslim-Americans launching their bids for national and statewide offices, analysts say, crediting the Trump administration’s policies with sparking the moment. The primary season ahead of the November midterm elections is in full swing, and it has already broken some records. AP reported, citing Jetpac, a non-profit company assisting Muslim-American candidates, that 90 Muslim-Americans initially stood for statewide and nationwide offices in this year’s elections. The number represents a record high, never seen after the 9/11 terrorist attacks eroded the trust of Americans in their fellow citizens of Islamic faith. Not all of them have crossed the first threshold on the way to become elected officials. Only some 50 are still standing in their respective races after primaries. In some states, like Michigan, primaries are yet to take place and may see the number of Muslim-American candidates plummeting further. Still, 50 is a huge increase from about a dozen Muslim-Americans that ran for office in 2016, the report notes. If they all succeed, Congress may receive up to nine new Muslim members. Among the most celebrated Muslim-American political newcomers is Abdul El-Sayed, who is running for governor of Michigan. According to Jetpac, at least 18 Muslim Americans are seeking to be elected to a state legislature, while 10 are running for the offices of governor, mayor and city council and others. The majority is vying for low-profile offices such as on school committees and planning boards. (rt.com)
