Senator Dino Melaye,(Kogi west) has regained freedom after spending 11 hours in the “wilderness”.

This was revealed by the Senator via his twitter handle Friday with a caption, “I thank God once again for escaping another dangerous attack. I also thank Nigerians for their prayers and show of Love.”

Recall Melaye’s brother raised alarm on Thursday that the senator had been kidnapped on his way to Lokoja where he is facing a gun-running trial.

Also, Ben Murray-Bruce, a Senator from Bayelsa, quoted the brother as saying Melaye was bundled into a Toyota Sienna while he was travelling to Kogi.

Reacting to his kidnap, the Nigerian Police revealed not to have received any report or complaint of the senator’s kidnap.

Melaye’s absence had the case adjourned till August 9.

Spent 11 hours in the wilderness traumatized but God preserved me. God is the best and in whom ONLY I trust. They will continue to try. WE SHALL OVERCOME!!!
