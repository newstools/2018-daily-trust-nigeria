The APC has promised to sue Engr. Buba Galadima and his officials in the Reformed All Progressives Congress (R-APC) for impersonation, fraudulent misrepresentation, conduct likely to breach public peace, as well as breach of trademark and infringement of copy right. The APC which reacted through its National Legal Adviser, Babatunde Ogala, to the purported formation of rAPC, likened Galadima’s action to the televised military address issued after a successful execution of a coup d’etat. “We practice a multi-party democratic system and therefore cannot stop Mr Galadima from forming his own political party if he so desires. However, he will not be allowed to do so using the APC brand. “For the infringement so far committed by Mr Galadima and the odium he has brought upon the APC brand we will be seeking civil redress against his person and that of his group. With respect to the criminal aspect of his conduct, we will be notifying the appropriate authorities to do the needful,” Ogala said.
