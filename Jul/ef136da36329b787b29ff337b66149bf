A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman have died after a gunman opened fire on a busy avenue in Canadaâ€™s largest city, police say. Thirteen other people, ranging in age between 10 and 59, were injured in the attack in the Greektown district of Toronto, police chief Mark Saunders told reporters. The suspect, 29, had an exchange of gunfire with police officers before being found dead nearby. The motive for the shooting is unknown. Police have not identified the suspect, who was from Toronto, and it is unclear if he was killed by police gunfire or took his own life. The attack happened on Sunday evening. In a video clip shared by Canadian media, a white man wearing a dark cap and dark clothing and carrying a shoulder bag can be seen stopping on a pavement and pulling out a handgun before firing shots.
