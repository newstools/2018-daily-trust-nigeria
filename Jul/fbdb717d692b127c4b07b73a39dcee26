The former Catalan president living in exile can be extradited to Spain, a German court has ruled. Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium days after the region’s abortive declaration of independence from Spain in October and was eventually arrested in Germany. The German court approved his extradition to face Spanish charges of misuse of public funds but not the graver charge of rebellion. German prosecutors must now decide on whether he will be handed over. They have already indicated they will extradite him. Mr Puigdemont pledged: “We will fight until the end, and we will win!” He described the decision of the court not to endorse the more serious charge of rebellion as a victory, saying he had “defeated the main lie” of the Spanish state.
