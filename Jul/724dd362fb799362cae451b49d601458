The Chairman of Senate Committee on National Identity and Population, Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi and two members of the House of Representatives from Kaduna yesterday hosted executives of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from Kaduna State. The meeting, which was held at the Senate’s wing of the National Assembly, was meant to perfect the plot of the lawmakers to dump the All Progressives Congress (APC). Our correspondent reports that Rep. Musa Soba of Soba Federal Constituency and Rep Rabiu Lawal of  Lere Constituency were in attendance at the meeting. The lawmakers were among the faction of the APC in Kaduna feuding with the state governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai. The rejection of a $350m loan request of the Kaduna State government has compounded the crisis in the party. Hunkuyi, in an interview, confirmed the meeting with the PDP executives. “The PDP leadership came to pay us a courtesy call and they wooed us to join their party. They requested us to join them and some of them are people I know very well. We had a very long and fruitful discussion with them. And it is under our consideration because everybody knows that we have been shortchanged and disenfranchised in the APC. We are not going to close any window in determining whatever we are going to do,” he said.
