No fewer than 30 persons were killed and dozens missing when Boko Haram insurgents ambushed a convoy of vehicles along the Dikwa-Ngala Road in Ngala Local Government Area Borno State yesterday, sources said. Security agents could not be reached for statement up to the time of filing this report. However, a top civilian JTF official at Dikwa told Daily Trust on phone that 27 vehicles of various sizes and capacity conveying commuters and goods from Dikwa to Ngala were completely torched by the insurgents as most commuters fell off and took to their heels in various directions. The insurgents were said to have ambushed the vehicles at Ramin Aljanu in between Logumani and Musune village along Dikwa/ Ngala highway, about 35 kilometres away to Gamboru Local Government headquarters. “I can confidently tell you that no fewer than 30 people were killed by the insurgents who rained bullets on the convoy and even launched a rocket shot at a yellow bus; and many who fell off the vehicles took to their heels in all directions sustained serious injuries,” he said. A man who said he lost three of his neighbours in the attack said the insurgents attacked the convoy on six Hilux vehicles. “Many lost their lives, in fact, three of my neighbors who used to live next to my house were killed; we could not account for the dozens that fled. When they started shooting, people fled into the bush, so we don’t how many of them are still missing. “Those injured were evacuated to Gamboru where they are receiving treatment. They (insurgents) carted away clothing materials, foodstuffs, mats, smoked fish and razed down all the vehicles,” he said.
