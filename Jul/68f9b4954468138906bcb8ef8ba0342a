Zimbabwe’s main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, has marched to the country’s elections body, demanding reforms to ensure that this month’s general elections will be free and fair. Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa presented a petition to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, as thousands of protesters denounced the management of the elections. The opposition want a say in how things are run. It wants to monitor the printing, storage and transportation of the ballot papers, plus access to the complete voters roll for auditing. The electoral commission says these demands go over and above the law and that very few countries in the world allow parties to be involved at this level. The demonstration is a reflection of how deep the mistrust runs, after years of contested elections under former President Robert Mugabe.
