The Federal Government said it would remodel the Federal Secretariat, Abuja through Public Private Partnership (PPP) to ensure safety of staff and boost productivity. The Head of Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF) Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita, who made the announcement yesterday in Abuja, said the scheme is a pilot and would be extended to other federal secretariats in the country. She spoke while signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the pilot PPP with Alpha Mead Development Company Limited. She said the MoU is to enable the company remodel the ground floor and the car parking lots of block ‘A’ Federal Secretariat Complex, Phase II. She said facilities in the secretariat have deteriorated over the years due to lack of maintenance, while others have become obsolete and that the state of the building was no longer conducive for workers, hence the partnership to give the complex a face lift. The Group Managing Director, Alpha Mead Development Company Limited, Mr Femi Akintunde, said the pilot project would start with the Ground floor of Block A, where over 1000 office spaces would be created and 800 car park spaces to ensure safety and wellbeing of staff.
