Professors Jerry Gana and Iyorwuese Hagher yesterday joined the race for the presidency under the platform of Social Democratic Party (SDP). The two presidential hopefuls were at the SDP national secretariat where they picked the nomination forms, thereby increasing the number of presidential aspirants of the party to five. Prof. Gana, while fielding questions from journalists, warned that Nigeria would implode if President Muhammadu Buhari returned for a second term. Prof. Hagher on the other hand said his plan was to rescue Nigeria.
