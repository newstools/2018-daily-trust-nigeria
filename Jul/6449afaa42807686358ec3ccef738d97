 The Mo Ibrahim Foundation congratulates Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea’s President Isaias Afwerki after they jointly declared peace and friendship between their countries. The foundation called the declaration a “courageous and historic move of ending punishing decades of dispute and conflict.” “The restoration of communications and transport between the two countries, after two decades of complete shutdown, will benefit citizens of both nations and beyond,” the foundation said in a statement. “At our 2018  Ibrahim Governance Weekend in Kigali, former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn strongly stated Ethiopia’s openness to dialogue, giving hope to the peace and friendship declared on Monday 9 July. “The joint declaration is a strong trigger for improving regional security and potential. We are confident that it will augment opportunities for regional, political and economic cooperation, which will benefit the Horn of Africa and the continent as a whole. We Africans are proud of the complete ownership of the peace process taken by Eritrea and Ethiopia, from initiating the peace talks to signing the joint declaration. The forward strides taken moves us closer towards a more peaceful and integrated continent.
