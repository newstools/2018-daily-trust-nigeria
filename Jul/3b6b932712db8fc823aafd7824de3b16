Senator Philip Tanimu Aduda has disbursed N55 million scholarships to indigent students across the six area councils who are studying at various tertiary institutions across the country. Aduda, represented by his Senior Legislative Aide, Ismaila Danjuma Ali Kawu, while handing a cheque to the president of Abuja Indigenous Students Association (AISA), Comrade Abdullahi Sanusi, said the gesture was aimed at assisting indigent students. He said the disbursement of the scholarships would encourage parents to send their children to school, adding that about 800 students benefited from the scholarship scheme last year. According to him, over 1,000 students benefit from this yearâ€™s scholarship scheme, adding that he has been able to also sponsor some exceptional students abroad for their studies.

The president of Abuja Indigenous Students Association (AISA), Comrade Abdullahi Sanusi, commended Aduda, for the scholarship, saying it would ease the burden of students while in school.
