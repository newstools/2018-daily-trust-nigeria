The Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the International Institute for Classical Arabic Language and Qur’anic Science, Abuja, Sheikh Abdulhakeem Baba Bankole, has called for concerted efforts at eradicating misconception of Islam, and to stem Islamophobia. He made the call yesterday in a statement e-mailed to Daily Trust Saturday. According to him, the primary goal of the institution is to teach and spread the beauty of the language of the Qur’an, the classical Arabic language to Muslims and non-Muslims in the society, so that they may fully comprehend the Qur’an. “Our ultimate goal at IIC Arabic and Qur’an is to educate tomorrow’s educators and leaders on the universality and comprehensiveness of the Qur’an and its sciences. Leaders whom we pray will become future advocates and promoters of world peace and security,” Bankole said, while also saying that the institute was originally established in Cairo, Egypt in 2003 before it commenced full operations in Abuja, Nigeria in 2017.
