An Ilorin High Court yesterday summoned the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Ibrahim Idris, to appear before it on Wednesday next week to justify the continued detention of Lekan Alabi, a Personal Assistant to Kwara State Governor Abdulfattah Ahmed, who was arrested over the April 5, 2018 armed robbery in Offa. This came as the lead counsel to the suspect, Adelodun Ibrahim, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) bemoaned the failure of the police to release another suspect over the same incident, Alhaji Babatunde Abdulwahab, the Chief of Staff to the governor, who was granted bail by another high court in the state. Adelodun, leading four other lawyers, told newsmen after yesterday’s proceedings that the refusal of the police to obey the court order on Abdulwahab was worrisome. The police was not represented at yesterday’s proceedings, although Adelodun told the court they had been served all related processes. The case was brought to Ilorin following the refusal of a Federal High Court in Abuja to hear it as the alleged crime was committed in Kwara. Alabi has been in detention since May 28, 2018 and has not been arraigned before any court, a development his counsel, Adelodun, argued contravened existing laws.
