The Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, was on Monday at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja for a meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The meeting, it was gathered, was over the protest by mobile policemen in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, against six-month unpaid allowances. The officers were reportedly posted to Borno in January in order to fortify the insurgency-ridden state. Osinbajo and the IGP met behind closed doors at the vice presidentâ€™s office. President Muhammmadu Buhari is currently in Mauritania for the 31st Ordinary Session of the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government. After the meeting, the IGP did not speak to State House correspondents on the outcome.
