The Niger Government has donated 10 Toyota Hilux vehicles to the  Police Command in the state to enhance security of lives and property in  the area. The Commissioner of Police, Dibal Yakadi , disclosed this in an  interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)  shortly after  distributing the vehicles to some selected  divisional police officers  under the command. Yakadi said provision of operational vehicles and communication  facilities would also enhance the performance of officers and men of the  command. He urged residents of the state to support the command with useful and timely information to forestall criminal activities. He said criminal activities would only be curbed if residents  volunteered information to the police on any suspicious persons or acts  in their environment. He said that already effective operational order had been issued to  the divisional police officers on how to deal with any form of security  threats. “ Stakeholders should support and partner with the police by  mobilising residents to volunteer information that could aid in  apprehending bad elements in their midst. ” We have  since reached out to traditional and religious leaders in  mobilising residents to be security conscious at all times by reporting  dubious characters in their communities to the appropriate authority,”  the commissioner said.
