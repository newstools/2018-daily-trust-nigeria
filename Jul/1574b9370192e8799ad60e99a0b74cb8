Pensioners in Osun State yesterday protested non-payment of their entitlements. They said many of their colleagues who were ill had died owing to lack of money to buy drugs and take care of themselves. Speaking at a peaceful protest in Osogbo, the state capital, the chairman of the state’s chapter of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP), Ganiyu Salawu, asked Governor Rauf Aregbesola to pay their pensions. He also appealed to the traditional rulers in the state to prevail on the governor to pay their entitlements without further delay. Salawu said the governor had ignored the union’s letterand five reminders sent to him to seek an audience with him on the matter.
