Kwara State government has spent over N6.5 billion between 2009 and 2018 on water reticulation scheme in an effort to tackle the perennial challenge of potable water in the state, particularly in Ilorin metropolis. A consultant to the state government on the project, Professor Sulaiman Adeyemi, disclosed this, adding that a sum of N1.9 billion was also captured in the 2018 budget to be spent on tertiary water reticulation in some parts of the state.
