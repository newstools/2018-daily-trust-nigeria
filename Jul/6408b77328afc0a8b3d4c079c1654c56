President of the Association for Consulting Engineering in Nigeria (ACEN), Engr. Charles Yele Akindayomi, has commended the Federal Government for engaging more indigenous engineers in construction projects. He said the period when Nigeria awarded contracts to foreign engineers and consultants at the expense of local professionals is over. He made the commendation at the 2018 extra-ordinary general meeting of the association with the theme ‘The Role of Engineering Consultants in the Implementation of the Presidential Executive Order 5’, held in Abuja. He charged  construction engineers to ensure that project designs were in line with international best practices, and stressed  the need to reposition local firms to take advantage of the Order 5. It will be recalled that  President Muhammadu Buhari had in February, signed the Executive Order 5, with the intention of improving local content in science, engineering and technology procurement. Minister for Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola had assured that MDAs have no option than to comply with the order. He said when he received the 16-page document from the Presidency, he directed all permanent secretaries under his portfolio to ensure strict compliance.
