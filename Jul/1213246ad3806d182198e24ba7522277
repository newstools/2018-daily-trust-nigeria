The federal government will probe suspected human trafficking in the case of the 155 Nigerian fans stranded in Russia after the World Cup, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, has said. The stranded Nigerians, who besieged the nation’s embassy in Moscow on July 12, were flown back to the country after President Muhammadu Buhari ordered their evacuation. Onyeama said after a discussion with the Director General of National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Ms Julie Okah–Donli, it was clear that there were possible cases of human trafficking among the returnees. Onyeama said one of the stranded fans was a nursing mother too young to have travelled to Russia solely for the World Cup. He added that an investigation would also be launched into an allegation that some travel agents cancelled the return tickets of the football fans without informing them, leaving them stranded in the European country.
