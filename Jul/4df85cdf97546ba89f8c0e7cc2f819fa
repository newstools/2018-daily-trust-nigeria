The FCT Administration has extended the payment of arrears of ground rents and sundry bills to August. The move, according to the FCT Director of Geographic Information Systems (AGIS), Dr Isa Ibrahim Jalo, is to afford defaulting property owners an opportunity to pay up. Jalo, who spoke while inspecting some facilities at the AGIS Customer Service, urged plot allottees, property owners and beneficiaries of Federal Government houses in Abuja to take advantage of the extension provided by the administration. He said settling outstanding ground rents and sundry bills by August 9, 2018 would save the affected persons the embarrassment that might result from inaction. He emphasized that all concerned allottees and beneficiaries who failed to clear their bills within this grace period would be penalised which action, he said, might include revocation of such titles as stipulated in the extant laws. The director said property owners should be responsive, adding that government needed such payments to provide infrastructure, social amenities and other services to the citizenry.
