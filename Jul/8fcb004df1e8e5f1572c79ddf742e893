Senate President Bukola Saraki may have gone into hiding following the invitation extended to him by the police to report and answer questions relating to the armed robbery in Offa in April. The police had on Monday night said Saraki should appear at its Intelligence Response Team at Guzape in Abuja by 8.am today. However, Saraki in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Yusuph Olaniyonu last night accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the fresh police invitation. When our correspondent went to Saraki's house at about 8.am this morning at Maitama District, it was observed â€Žthat only few vehicles were parked with only few people carrying out their normal activities. It was later learnt that Saraki's residence had come under siege by some policemen but that they later left even before our correspondent's arrival. When our correspondent contacted Olaniyonu about the whereabouts of his principal, he said he could not confirm as he had no access to the house. He said he was in the residence early in the morning and that when he saw "massive police deployment on the street," he decided to leave. Also, the spokesman to Ike Ekweremadu, the Deputy Senate President, Uche Anichukwu, told Daily Trust on telephone that his principal's house was under siege by the police.
