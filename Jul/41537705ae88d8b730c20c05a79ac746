The Executive President Commanding, World Commandant General of Chaplaincy International, Apostle Edward Taylor of Clinton Mississippi USA, has expressed optimism that Nigeria will experience economic and tourism boom soon. He spoke weekend at the Old Government House Chapel Rayfield, in Jos the Plateau State capital‎, at the 2018 Commissioning and Decoration of New Mac-Corps Chaplains/Doctorate. ‎He said Nigeria could not be backward with her huge potentials as well as vast human and natural resources. In his address, read by the Africa General Commandant, Dr. T.I. Ambek, he said Plateau was displaying great leadership qualities in tourism and economic boom. “We believe in unity in diversity which  should be such that unity should not at the expense of our individuality. We stress on peace, love and goodwill towards one great humanity and not religious or denomination, especially when such a denomination majors on the minors and thus harms or neglects the in-thing.” “As a body we cannot afford to stay on the peripheries when we are losing grip of the centre. In the light of the above, our well-structured and scrutinized doors are open to all who believe in maintaining the firm belief that chaplaincy is a noble course for honest and good hearts. “The about-to-be-commissioned should feel and know the weight of what of their responsibility and what it takes to properly represent the noble organizations they are to represent in order to do an excellent job. They should be warned that there are self-corrective measures that will catch up with any deviant,” he said.
