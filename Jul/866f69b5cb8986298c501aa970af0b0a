Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has enjoined journalists to ensure the promotion of public good through verifiable news, in the discharge of their duties. Dogara made the plea while speaking on the topic, "Journalism and Public Good" during the launch of Maktoub Magazine in Abuja over the weekend. He tasked Nigerian journalists to abide by the ethics of the profession by placing national interest above all other considerations without recourse to fake news and irresponsible social media posts, which according to him are "dangers to democracy." â€œIn this era of instantaneous media, it is difficult to define a journalist. So, the question is who is a journalist? What happens when the pursuit of truth collides with national interests? Which one serves the public good better? That is the question we should always answer. As we approach 2019, it is pertinent to draw a line between fake news and real news. But my charge to journalists is to ensure we always put forward information that are verifiable and tested so that we can serve the public good," he stated. The Speaker identified the media as a vital tool in a democracy without which informed debate, public accountability, progress and development would be elusive. He cited the example of a recent bill in the National Assembly to regulate the social media, which he said was eventually withdrawn by the sponsors because the people kicked against it; however, he made a case for the need to temper press freedom with social responsibility to guard against defamation and public harm. He also commended Mariam Mohammed, the publisher of Maktoub magazine, for speaking the truth to power through responsible journalism, urging other journalists to borrow a leaf from her by telling their stories in angles that will benefit public good.
