Some Abuja natives have said FCT Minister Muhammad Musa Bello has broken a 32-year jinx with the rehabilitation of the Abaji-Rubochi road. The youths, under the aegis of Abuja Original Inhabitants Youth Empowerment, while commending the minister said the rehabilitation of the 10.2 kilometres road will boost economic activities in rural communities in Kuje and Abaji area councils. In a statement from the organ’s president, Isaac David, the natives said the road was neglected for over 32 years. The group, however called on the FCT Administration to extend the road to Kuje main town which, they said, will reduce traffic along Lokoja-Abuja road. “We also plead that other rural roads that constitute threat to communities in the FCT because of their deplorable condition be captured in the current rehabilitation programme to ease traffic,” the statement added.
