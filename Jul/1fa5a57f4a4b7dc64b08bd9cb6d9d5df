With rice producers in the country struggling against imported varieties to dominate the market, the Federal Government hinted at plans to shut land borders between Nigeria and a neighbouring country to curtail rice smuggling into the country. Daily Trust correspondents visited border towns across the country and uncovered the web of corruption and family ties that have kept rice smugglers in business. The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Audu Ogbeh two weeks ago, disclosed that the government has plans to shut land borders between Nigeria and a neighbouring country, which he did not name, in order to curtail rice smuggling into the country. “A neighbour of ours is importing more rice than China is importing they use their ports to try to damage our economy,” he said, while addresing youth in a  leadership clinic under the auspices of Guardians of the Nation International (GOTNI) in Abuja Nigeria had banned the importation of rice through land borders, but that has not curtailed the smuggling as of yet. Mr Ogbeh said shutting the borders has become necessary as smuggling is costing the country $5 million daily. Although the Minister stated that the country had, in the last two years, reduced rice import by 95 per cent and increased the number of rice farmers from five to 13 million, imported rice however dominates the markets, something corroborated by Daily Trust findings in a market survey by our reporters. “As we speak, a neighbour of ours is importing more rice than China is importing. They do not eat parboiled rice, they eat white rice, they use their ports to try and damage our economy. But as Daily Trust finding show, it will take more than closing down the borders to stop rice smuggling into the country.
