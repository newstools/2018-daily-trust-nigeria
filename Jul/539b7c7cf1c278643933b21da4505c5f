Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has said that nobody can prevent him from “speaking against injustice and the mass killing of Nigerians”. The senator, who arrived Abia State amidst funfair and jubilation from his supporters and well wishers, spoke shortly after arriving the Sam Mbakwe International Airport in Imo State. When asked by reporters why he was arrested by DSS, he maintained that he was not aware of any reason until when the DSS agents visited his house for search. He added that during the search, they accused him of sponsoring and aiding IPOB. Abaribe said the actions of the DSS were aimed at stopping him from making certain statements on the floor of the Senate, but maintained that he will not be cowed into submission as he will continue defending the right of Nigerians and speaking the truth at all times.
