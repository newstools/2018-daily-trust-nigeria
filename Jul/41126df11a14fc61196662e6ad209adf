The Israeli embassy has equipped about 70 internally displaced children in Abuja with ‘self-learning’ tablets. The children, between the ages of 6-9, were selected from Durumi Internally Displaced Persons’ camp, Abuja. It was an initiative of the Israeli Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Guy Feldman, to promote self-learning with the aid of technology, said a statement by the embassy’s Press Officer, Zanswat Bowsan. The statement said the tablets were fitted with basic learning applications that teach language and arithmetic skills. “For 10 days, the children were given the opportunity to self-learn through these devices,” it said. Israel, according to the statement, urged the Federal Government to do more in making education accessible to all children. “Many Nigerian children are keen to experience formal education, but are unable to, due to circumstances beyond their control. “In a country where 60 percent of its 200 million people are children under the age of 15, the attack on education has become a very worrisome and a less discussed aspect of the insurgency in the country. “The fact that Nigeria has the world’s highest number of out-of-school children in millions should be a walk-up call. Children are children. The project the Embassy of Israel conducted just highlighted the innate ability and zeal of children to adapt to new methods of learning. “We must remember that skillful and informed adults are grown children who were exposed to the right educational opportunities. With the completion of this project, we are optimistic that a message of hope will reverberate through Nigeria,” the statement said.
