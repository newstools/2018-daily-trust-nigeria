About 400 members of Prince Adedayo Adeyeye Movement (PAAM) from Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government Area of Ekiti State have defected to the APC from the PDP. Mr. Ayodele Matthew led Esure-Ekiti members while Adeyeye Ajibola led new defectors from Iropora. The immediate past Special Adviser on Political Matters to Gov. Ayodele Fayose, Ademola Bello, urged new members to feel safe in APC, saying the party would accommodate everyone without discrimination. Bello said the partyâ€™s governorship candidate, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, was a man of honour who always wanted to make a mark in the life of the people without conditions. Ayodele, Ajibola and Ogunsakin spoke in turns, declaring that they left the PDP because Fayose had turned the party to a private property for personal pleasure.
