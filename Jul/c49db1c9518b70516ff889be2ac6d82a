Britain has called on Russia to explain the latest nerve agent poisoning incident in southern England, which has left two people critically ill in hospital. UK’s Interior Minister Sajid Javid confirmed an earlier police statement that a man and a woman - both British nationals - were exposed to the nerve agent Novichok - the same substance that poisoned former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia earlier this year. Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, were found unconscious at a house on Saturday in the town of Amesbury, near Salisbury. “It is unacceptable for our people to be deliberate or accidental targets,” said Javid at an emergency cabinet meeting in London on Thursday, adding that he expects “further disinformation from the Kremlin” on the latest nerve agent attack.
