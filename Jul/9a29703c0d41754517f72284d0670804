A chieftain of the APC in Kaduna State, Alhaji Lawal Adamu Usman popularly known as Mr LA, has resigned from the party. Usman, a founding member of the APC in Kaduna, said he dumped the party because of alleged indiscriminate persecution of party members with the aim of restricting the space for their aspirations in the upcoming elections. In a resignation letter he addressed to the APC chairman of Unguwar Dosa Ward in Kaduna North Local Government, and copied Governor Nasir el-Rufai, National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and President Muhammadu Buhari, Usman said, resigning from APC was the only principled decision that could be made in the circumstances of the many crises rocking the party in Kaduna State. Mr LA had indicated interest to run for Senate.
