The minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige,  goofed at the All People’s Congress, APC rally held in Ekiti state as he urged electorates to vote for the incumbent governor, Ayodele Fayose who is from the People’s Democratic Party, PDP. The minister said “if you marry 2 wives, you go know which one wey better. Fayose is the better Wife, E de cook, E de give husband better food ... bring back  Fayose on Saturday”. Nigige repeatedly told the people to vote for Fayose before he was corrected that APC’s candidate is Fayemi and not Fayose. The rally was supposed to garner support for Kayode Fayemi who is contesting under the APC platform.
