The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Mr Boss Mustapha said Nigeria depends on transparency to develop and achieve success as a nation. The SGF said this yesterday in his office when he received in audience the management team of Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC). The ICRC management presented the 2018 Africa Investor Award which the Commission won at the recent Africa Investor CEO Infrastructure Project Developers Summit in Mauritius to the SGF. Receiving the award, Mr Mustapha congratulated the delegation on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari saying the award in faraway Mauritius was an indication of the resilience of Nigerian spirit. A spokesman in the office of the SGF, John Mbanefo quoted Mustapha in a statement as also commending the innovations the current management of the ICRC has introduced. The Acting Director-General of the ICRC, Chidi K.C Izuwah said he was in the SGF’s office to present the 2018 Africa Investor (Ai) Infrastructure Investment Awards in which Nigeria won in the category of the Infrastructure Regulator of the Year from Mauritius. He commended President Buhari’s Administration for its doggedness in the fight against corruption, using transparency as a veritable tool, and the zeal to support the commission to achieve success.
