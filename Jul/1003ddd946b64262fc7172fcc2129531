The Federal Government has urged traditional to partner government towards building peace and security in the country. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who made the appeal yesterday in Abuja, said the partnership between traditional authorities and government was crucial at a time Nigeria is witnessing rising cases of killings in parts of the country. Osinbajo spoke at the 10th National Development Summit of Traditional Rulers with the theme, “Make Nigeria great again”. To guarantee peace and security, he said “A great deal of emphasis is often placed on the role of law enforcement agencies in maintaining peace and security. They are critical element in determining criminalities and ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice, but if we over focus on law enforcement and overlook the place of the non-coercive conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms, then we are doing ourselves and the people of Nigeria a great disservice. “Dialogue and engagement are just as important as law enforcement, especially in a situation triggered by misunderstanding and disagreement between people and communities who have existed peacefully side-by-side for centuries,” he said. According to him, traditional leaders have the capacity to champion the continuous dialogue and engagement because of the respect they command from the widest stakeholders and parties across the country. The Ovie of Uvwie Kingdom in Delta State, Dr Emmanuel Sideso, expressed concern that traditional rulers have not done their best in giving civic education to their communities.
