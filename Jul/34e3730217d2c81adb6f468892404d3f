A Nigerian national, Mr Ozumba Tochukwu Lawrence, has been shot dead by yet to be identified assailant in South Africa. The incident was said to have occurred at 10 Koppe, Middleburg, Mpumalanga, South Africa, on 6 July, 2018, Nigerian Consulate-General in Johannesburg said. The motive behind the killing is unknown, it added. A statement by David Abraham, Vice Consul (Information & Culture), said “An eye witness account has it that an unknown man made a way into the compound of Mr Lawrence and requested to see him. “On being told about his guest, he came out to meet him, and the man opened fire on him and shot him six [6] times, resulting in his death before he reached hospital. It is yet to be established the reason behind the sad incident.” Abraham described the killing as “very unfortunate and condemnable”. “The Consulate hereby, commiserates with the deceased family and indeed, the entire Nigerian community in South Africa,” he said. The Nigerian Consulate called on the South African authorities to unravel the mystery behind the act. The Consulate called on Nigerians living in South Africa to remain calm and eschew violence, “as we seek to obtain justice for the deceased and members of his family.”
