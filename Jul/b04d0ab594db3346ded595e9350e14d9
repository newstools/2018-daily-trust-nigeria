The Egbura ethnic group in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State have lauded Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura over his meeting last week in Abuja with stakeholders of Bassa ethnic group. A statement yesterday in Abuja by the President Egbura National Development Association (ENDA) Prof Ibrahim Aguye, said the community commended the governor for his efforts at midwifing lasting peace between the two ethnic groups. The association said, while the Egbura were never opposed to the quest of chiefdom for Bassas, it however, called on Al-Makura to engage relevant stakeholders in the process to avoid further acrimony. “Since creation of chiefdoms all over the world are rooted in history and tradition; the governor, in his quest to bring a lasting solution to the seemingly intractable situation, is hereby called to be guided by the history and tradition of the land. “This can only be achieved when the governor involves genuine stakeholders from both sides in the process leading to such weighty decision. It is in this light that we further welcomed the idea of a tripartite meeting proposed by His Excellency.”
