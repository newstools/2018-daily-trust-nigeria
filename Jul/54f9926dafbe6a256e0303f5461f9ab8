The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has said there is no crack in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the council. He, however, said party members considering decamping to other parties should do so early so that the party could plan ahead. Candido, while addressing journalists on Wednesday, said the party was intact and urged members not to be perturbed by the mass defection at the National Assembly on Monday. “We want to assure the party that APC is intact and waxing stronger in AMAC and by the grace of God 2019 will be another successful outing for APC as a party in the FCT. “There is no crack as far as I am concerned,” he said, adding that political events would reveal genuine progressives in the party. He said the party would not lose sleep over the defection but would rather lose sleep on means of ensuring better governance. “As for APC members in AMAC, we want to assure them that APC will not lose any sleep because of the defection.  “In the area council here you will not hear of anybody defecting. For those who may wish to defect however, they should do it now so that we will begin to plan ahead. “For any council executive member under this administration who wants to defect, you are free; let us know them so that we can keep moving with the correct progressives around us,” he said.
