Daughters of Abraham Foundation (DOAF), a non-governmental organization (NGO) set up by the late wife of Senator Jeremiah Useni, has organized a stakeholders’ dinner in Abuja. Speaking at the event at the weekend, director of the foundation, Evangelist Margaret S. Bargo, said the founder, late Julie Useni, had left behind an enduring legacy which needed to be sustained. She said  many girls who were wasting away on the streets of Abuja had been rehabilitated and reintegrated into the society through the  humanitarian efforts of the foundation. Mrs Bargo, however, said financial constraints were limiting the work of the foundation, as according to her, she was getting requests from members of the public to intervene in the lives of so many other girls on the streets of Abuja and beyond. She however said the foundation lacked the financial capacity to expand its operations. While thanking the stakeholders for their support in the past 24 years, she urged them to continue to support the foundation to sustain its operations. “We are here to thank all of you who at different stages of our development and growth within these 24 years had stood by us, come rain come sunshine. You have tirelessly contributed and are contributing to our cause. “Since 1994, many of you here have sacrificed your time, effort, prayers, resources, service and much more to bring DOAF to where we are today,” she said. The grand patron, Senator Useni, thanked all stakeholders for attending the dinner and encouraged them to donate to the foundation.
