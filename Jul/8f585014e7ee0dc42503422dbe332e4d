A Bwari Chief Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, on Tuesday admitted a 31-year-old business man, Anya Ifeanyi and Emmanuel Idoko, 32, bail for N100,000, for alleged electricity theft. In her ruling after their arraignment, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs Akanni Idayat-Olaide, ordered the defendant to produce a reliable surety each, and adjourned the case until July 26 for hearing.  A statement by the AEDC Public Relations Head, Ahmed Shekarau said the defendants residing in Bwari, were arraigned by the Police on a two-count-charge of joint act and theft. They, however, pleaded not guilty after the charges were read out to them.   According to the prosecutor, the matter was reported at the Bwari Divisional Police Station by Micheal Okon, a staff of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), on July 10 at 6p.m.  It was alleged in the charge sheet that the defendants conspired and by-passed the AEDC prepaid metre which Ifeanyi, was illegally using in his office, located opposite Bwari market.  The Prosecutor, Mrs Agnes Adewunmi-Aluko, Senior State Counsel, however asked the court to adjourn the matter in order to begin trial against both suspects.  Electricity theft is an offence contrary to section 1 (10) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act, Cap M17 laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2014 and punishable under the same Section.  In May, 2017, the AEDC Plc and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) of the Federation signed an agreement for a partnership to fight electricity theft within AEDC's area of operations.  This followed the approval of a special task force for investigation and prosecution of electricity theft cases under the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, 2005 by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.
