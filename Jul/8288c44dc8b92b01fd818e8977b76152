The Nigerian mission in South Africa has expressed shock over the killing of a Nigerian, Linus Chibuzor-Nwankwo from Enugu State by a fellow Nigerian, Lawrence Nwarienne from Anambra State, in that country. The Consul General of Nigeria in South Africa, Godwin Adama, in a statement yesterday said the 42 year-old Chibuzor-Nwankwo was allegedly shot by Nwarienne, who was operating a bar in South Africa. He said the incident happened in the early hours of Friday in Kempton Park, Johannesburg in South Africa. He said Nwarienne shot the deceased at his bar for reasons not very clear. Adama said the suspect was arrested by the police and investigation into the case has commenced. “This is a development that is becoming frightening and may make South African police authorities to blame other future killings on the same trend. We are taking it seriously,” he said.
