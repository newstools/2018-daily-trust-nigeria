The chairman of FCT chapter of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Comrade Abdullahi Suleiman Ango, has blamed the rate of drug abuse among the youth to lack of family orientation. Ango, who spoke with newsmen at the council secretariat in Abuja on Friday, said drug abuse among youth has become prevalent not only in the FCT but across the entire the country. He said various institutions such as family, federal and states established agencies were not executing their responsibilities to tame the situation. ‘If you look at what is happing today, youths are engaged in so much nuisance, not only drug abuse, and if you look at it from the sociological point of view, you will discover that it is lack of orientation from the family, “ he said. He said it was unfortunate that the youth have lost core-values, and blame the government for not creating jobs or empowering the youth, adding that lack of access to formal source of livelihood pushed the youth into engaging in social vices in the society. He said lack of employment opportunities by government had forced some of the youth into crimes, internet fraud, armed robbery among social ills that are inimical to the well being of the country. Ango, said government should address the issue of drug abuse and other crimes and always engage youth groups and associations as well as youth voluntary organizations for sensitization. He noted that the FCT, being centre of Nigeria, needs to be secured and free from miscreants that may cause havoc and pains on the country. He further advised government on the need to partner with the youth council and  associations in order to empower them. “Even though government job is no longer coming, but the youth need to be engaged, as they need to be incorporated into the society,” he added.
