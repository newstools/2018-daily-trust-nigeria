The ten states listed to benefit from the gesture are, Anambra, Benue, Bayelsa, Bauchi, Kebbi, Kaduna, Kogi, Niger, Ogun and Zamfara. The rice mills will be given to these states on loan payable in ten years. It would be recalled that the Federal Executive Council had in April this year, approved N10.7 billion for the establishment of ten rice mills in ten states. Chief Ogbeh told journalists after the signing ceremony that the ministry would advertise for ten states identified to come forward to off take after 10% down payment with evidence of having the  technical capacity to operate and own a rice mill. “When the company arrives, they will install these mills and then the Bank of Agriculture will take over the repayment of these loans over the period of ten years,” the minister said. He also hinted that Dangote has brought in 10 new rice milling equipment with a total capacity of one million metric tonnes of rice annually.
