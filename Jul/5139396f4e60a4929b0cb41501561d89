President Muhammadu Buhari must go beyond verbal condemnation of the killings in Plateau and other parts of the country and take decisive steps to end the carnage, federal lawmakers from Plateau State have said. They said the president must also ensure that all the communities at risk of being attacked were adequately secured to prevent further attacks. The Plateau lawmakers told journalists in Abuja yesterday that the Federal Government must rise up to the challenge of fulfilling its constitutional responsibility by stopping the genocide, putting an end to land grabbing plans and annexation as well as recover land under illegal occupation. They noted with dismay the statement by the presidency that the people should accept ranching or continue to face death, saying “we demand clarification to its intent and purpose.” Reading a prepared text on behalf of other Plateau lawmakers, with the exception of Ahmed Idris Wase,  Johnbull Shekarau said, “We want to draw the attention of the nation  and the world to plans by some vested interests to further harass the traumatized communities by subjecting them to double jeopardy.”
