Hundreds of prospective voters in Ekiti state on Monday besieged the office of the Independent National Electoral  Commission (INEC), in Ado Ekiti, demanding for their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs). But some of them alleged that the commission might have sold their cards to desperate politicians since they claimed they had been visiting the office for months without getting the cards. But the spokesman of INEC in the state, Taiwo Gbadegesin, dismissed the allegation as false and one coming from  aggrieved electorate who merely wish to say anything offensive in anger. One of the early arrival at the INEC office, Sola Akindele, from Oye Ekiti, said he transfered his card to Ado, but regretted that he was yet to get the card since last week.
