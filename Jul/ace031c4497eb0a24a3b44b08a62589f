The Plateau Scholars and Researchers Forum (PSRF) has blamed politicians and conflict merchants for the attacks on some villages of the state. The forum, in a statement by its chairman, Prof. Danladi Atu, called on security agencies to intensify efforts towards fishing out attackers. The forum said internal collaborators and conspirators were adding flames to the insecurity in the state. “To them (politicians), it is they that should be on the pedestal of power and dictate the direction of the state apparatus and its future,” it said. It said the recent attack on Governor Simon Bako Lalong’s convoy affirmed that some politicians had taken the advantage of the security situation to make the state ungovernable.
