Southeast governors have totally rejected calls for the release of grazing land for cattle rearing.

They made their position known during the one-day meeting of governors of the Southeast geo-political zone in Enugu.

The governors insisted they would not donate any land for ranching being proposed by the Federal Government.

The Chairman of the Forum, David Umahi of Ebonyi State, who read the communique said: “We want to dismiss rumour being peddled around over the issue of ranching. 

"We want to make it clear that the South-East has no land for ranching and nobody has requested us to donate any land for ranching.

“The Federal Government knows that the Southeast doesn’t have enough land for ranching. So, we are categorically saying that we are not donating any land for ranching.”
