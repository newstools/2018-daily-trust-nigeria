Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar on Sunday visited former Military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida at the latter’s Hill-top residence in Minna, Niger State. Atiku arrived IBB's mansion from Minna Airport around 12:35pm where he held closed-door meeting with the former military president for about four hours. Although details of what transpired at the meeting were sketchy as journalists were barred from entering the former leaders’ residence, sources said the visit may not be unconnected with the presidential ambition of the former vice president.
