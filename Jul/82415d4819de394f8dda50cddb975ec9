A total of 1,500 members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abaji Area Council. Among those that defected, were a former PDP campaign director general to the immediate past chairman of the council, Alhaji Muhammed Angulu Bello; Assistant PDP local government treasurer, Salihu Musa Soje; PDP ex-officio, Hajiya RamatuÂ  Danjuma; PDP vice chairman of Central ward, Adamu Danjuma Ozuye; and some executives of the PDP. APC chairman in the area, Alhaji Mohammed Haruna Yaba, who received the defectors at a ceremony held at Adamu Shuaibu Memorial town hall on Saturday, commended them for making a bold and wise decision. He assured them that the ruling APC would always treat and give them equal opportunities in all affairs of party in the area, and called on other PDP members to follow the example of the defecting members. Speaking on behalf of the decampees, a former PDP vice chairman of Central Ward, Adamu Danjuma Ozuye, said their decision to decamp to the APC was informed by the on-going transformation under the leadership of the council boss, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya. He said the present administration on assumption of office has also been able to touch the lives of residents, irrespective of party differences. He said the policies of the APC-led Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari have been a tremendous success in building confidence of Nigerians in tackling major issues facing the country. On his part, the chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Ajiya, said he was impressed that opposition members were able to identify what his administration has achieved within the last two years in office despite challenges of funds. He commended the former PDP members for pitching their tent with the ruling party, and assured them that his administration would always carry them along in whatever will move the council forward.
