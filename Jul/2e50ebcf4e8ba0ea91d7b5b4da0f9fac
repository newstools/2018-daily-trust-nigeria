The Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, on Tuesday did not honour an invitation from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to answer questions over corruption allegations. EFCC sources told Daily Trust that Ekweramadu did not show up despite the invitation extended to him from the Commission. Daily Trust gathered that security operative from the EFCC had today cordoned off the Apo resident of the Deputy Senate President. However, at the time of filing this report, the operatives were said to have been withdrawn without arresting Ekewramadu. Attempts to contact the spokesman of the EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, were unsuccessful as his mobile phone number was not reachable. EFCC letter to Ekweremadu, dated 24th July, a copy of which was seen by Daily Trust also requested that Ekweremadu submit himself to the EFCC at 10 am today. The letter titled; ‘case of conspiracy, abuse of office and money laundering,’ was signed by one Muhammed Umar Abba as Director of Operations. It was gathered that the EFCC expects Ekweremadu to still honour the invitation at a later date.
