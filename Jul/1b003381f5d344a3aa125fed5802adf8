A Federal High Court in Osogbo, Osun State, has granted a leave of mandamus to compel the National Assembly to commence impeachment proceedings against President Muhammad Buhari. A lawyer, Mr Kanmi Ajibola, who was one of the two people that went to court over the matter, told Daily Trust yesterday. The other person is Sulaiman Adeniyi. Ajibola said Justice Maurine Adaobi Onyetenu ordered the National Assembly to immediately commence impeachment process against President Muhammadu Buhari. Ajibola said he and Adeniyi had written the National Assembly requesting it to impeach President Buhari over constitutional breaches. The lawyer said the Senate and House of Representatives ignored the request, which prompted them to go to court. In the motion ex-parte, Olaniyi and Sulaiman said President Buhari had in flagrant violation of the 1999 constitution contested election, won and was sworn in as the president on the 29th day of May 2015 without possessing the basic constitutional requirement to qualify for the contest of the election. They further alleged President Buhari in flagrant violation of section 137 (1) (j) of the 1999 constitution presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the purpose of the 2015 presidential election that brought him to office. “In the light of the 4th Respondent’s placement to continue in the office as the president, he has no certificate and basic requirement upon which this placement to continue in the office can be placed,” he said. Olaniyi said the court adjourned the matter till October 30, 2018 even as he vowed to pursue case to a logical conclusion.
