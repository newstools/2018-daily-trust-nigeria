The Senate will tomorrow begin the process of a fresh amendment to the 1999 Constitution with a view to establishing state police. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives had last week agreed to revisit the issue of state police following the spate of killings in the country. At the plenary session yesterday, Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu said a bill on state police would be coming for first reading on the floor of the Senate tomorrow. Ekweremadu also announced that a meeting of the special ad-hoc committee on Constitution amendment, which he chairs, would be held yesterday.
