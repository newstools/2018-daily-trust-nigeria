All 12 boys and their football coach have been rescued from a Thai cave after an 18 day ordeal, the Thai Navy SEALs said in a Facebook post. The post translations reads “We are not sure if this is a miracle, a science, or what. All the thirteen Wild Boars are now out of the cave.” Another post by the seal reads: "12 wild pigs and coaches out of the cave. Safe everyone. Hooyah"
