The Canadian Specialist Hospital (CSH), Dubai, United Arab Emirates will soon offer free surgical treatment to indigent Nigerians, the Head, Business Development of the hospital, Anoop Achuthan told journalists in Abuja at the weekend. He said the exercise was part of the Corporate Social Responsibility programme of the hospital, adding that it would be done in collaboration with charity clubs and non-governmental organisations. He said, “The Canadian Specialist Hospital (CSH) is the brainchild of its Chairman, Mr. Mohammad Rashid Al Falasi. The aim of establishing a facility in Nigeria is to help curb medical tourism among Nigerians, which is very high at the moment.” Achuthan said over 500 patients arrive at Canadian Specialist Hospital in Dubai each day, adding that “Our aim is to assist Nigerians with their healthcare requirements.”
