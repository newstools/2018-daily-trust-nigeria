The Syrian government has condemned the evacuation over the weekend of the White Helmets civil defence group from a war zone in the south of the country. Damascus described the move, carried out by Israel, as a “criminal operation” by “Israel and its tools”. Some 422 volunteers and family members were taken to Jordan via the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It was feared that they would be persecuted by advancing government forces in southern Syria. Responding to the move on Monday, Syria’s foreign ministry said that “words of condemnation are not enough to denounce this despicable act”.
