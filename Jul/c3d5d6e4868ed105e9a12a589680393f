A youth group, under the aegis of Abuja South Youth Forum of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has pledged its support to the House of Representatives aspirant for the constituency, Ahmad Abubakar Sadiq, ahead of the 2019 election. Chairman of the Abuja South APC ward youth leaders, Ismaila Y. Adamu, stated this during the kick-off of a football competition organised by Sadiq at Dabi-Bako in Kwali area council on Saturday. He said the APC youth forum had unanimously declared its support for the aspirant because of his love for the youth of the constituency. He said SadiqÂ  had the capacity to give attention to the socio-economic problems of Abuja south. Speaking earlier, Sadiq said youth were the bedrock of any society, hence, he chose to place emphasis on their activities so that it would divert their attention from immoral and social vices in the society.
