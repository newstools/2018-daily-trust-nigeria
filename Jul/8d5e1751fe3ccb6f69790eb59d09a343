The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) may suspend the ongoing nationwide Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) in August. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the hint emerged during INEC quarterly consultative meeting with the media on Thursday in Abuja. INEC at the meeting stated that it needed to suspend the exercise in good time in order to complete the procedures required for data processing, production and distribution of the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) ahead of 2019 general elections. The Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) states that “the registration of voters, updating and revision of register voters under this section shall stop not later than 60 days before any election covered by this Act’’. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, speaking at the meeting, said from previous experience, the timeline required from the close of registration to the point of  production and issuance of PVCs to prospective voters was about 120 days. “This time span is required for the purpose of claims and objections and other backed activities including running the Business Rules and Automated Fingers Identification System (AFIS).” “Another 30 days is required from the date of PVC production to the point of issuance to registered voters. Yakubu also said that the commission would give the needed attention to collection of PVCs to ensure that the prospective owners of uncollected cards did so ahead of 2019. Meanwhile, the media executives in a communiqué resolved that the Commission should ensure that all qualified Nigerians were registered. The communiqué was jointly signed by Austin Maho, Editor Nigeria Pilot; Gbenga Aruleba, Head Reportorial, African Independent Television; for the media and Malam Mohamed Haruna, INEC National Commissioner.
