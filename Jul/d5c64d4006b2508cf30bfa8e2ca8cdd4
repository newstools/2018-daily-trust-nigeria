 Three Russian sisters have allegedly stabbed their father to death after years of sexual abuse.   The siblings, Kristina, 19, Angelina, 18 and Maria, 17, stabbed their dad multiple times to his death.  The sisters who confessed to killing their 57-year-old father may spend 15 years in jail.  Their heroin-addict father was found with dozens of stab wounds near a lift inside the family’s flats in Moscow, Russia.  While confessing, the siblings claimed they suffered years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse.  On the day of the attack, they said their father had threatened them with a knife forcing one of the sisters to grab the knife and stab him, and the others joined in the attack.  In their defense, friends and neighbours claimed the father was tyrannical and that his wife left him because of his abuse, while a son, now a student at Moscow University, had been “thrown out” of the home by the father.  One family friend said she knew that at least one girl had been “sexually abused”.
