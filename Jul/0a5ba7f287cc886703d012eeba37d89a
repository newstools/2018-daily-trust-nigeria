A mild drama occurred on Friday at the Ejigbo Magistrate’s court, when a 38-year-old man, Mr. Segun Mabaoreje, in a bid to escape justice, ran out of the court room and jumped into a canal. It took the intervention of policemen attached to the magistrate to rearrest the suspect who is being tried for robbery and illegal possession of fire arms. The prosecutor, Inspector G. Simon, prepared another charge and he was arraigned for attempting to escape. The Presiding Magistrate, Mr. L.K.J. Layeni, did not grant him bail as his attempted escape happened while the court was in session. He ordered that the suspect be remanded in prison custody and adjourned the case till August, 6. The accused was arrested by the police at Igando for burglary and attempt to steal. He said the incident happened at 15 Showunmi Street in Egan area of Lagos. Mr. Mabaoreje was not the only accused person who had tried such in the past. Another suspect had tried to escape in the same court but he failed. He was charged and remanded in prison. Also, a young suspect brought to Ogba Magistrates court jumped from the court’s 3-storey building and died on the spot in his attempt to escape.
