The Berom Youth Moulders Association and Berom Patriots yesterday condemned Saturday’s attack on Governor Simon Bako Lalong’s convoy, but said the incident should not be accorded an ethnic tone since it happened in a cosmopolitan area. A statement issued by the Berom Youth Moulders Association stated that its President, Rwas Choji Dalyop received with great shock the appalling news of the attack on the governor’s convoy while Lalong was exiting an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp. The statement signed by its national Publicity Secretary, Jatau Davou Gyang stated that there should be no justification blaming the attack an ethnic group adding that,  “we do not wish to by this statement shield bad eggs amongst our youth who probably partook in the unwholesome act,  but it must be viewed with utmost sense of rationality to avoid tendencies of causing further division amongst the united and good people of Plateau.” Also, the Berom Patriots in a statement signed by its President, Dachollom Badung and Secretary, Gyang David stated that though the IDP camp is located in Berom land, “it should not be misconstrued that the attack was carried out by Berom people.” “While we condemn the attack on our peace loving governor’s convey, we make bold to say that some miscreants with ulterior motive might have taken advantage of the vulnerability of the IDPs to carry out their heinous activities,” it stated.
