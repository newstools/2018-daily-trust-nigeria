Pakistan has been hit by violence on the day of its general elections - with at least 31 dead in the worst attack. A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a polling station in the city of Quetta. The Islamic State group said it had carried out the attack. Elsewhere, minor blasts and clashes left several injured and two dead. Millions have voted in the polls, with the parties of ex-cricket star Imran Khan and disgraced former PM Nawaz Sharif competing for the most seats. Voting officially closed at 18:00 (13:00 GMT), with the results probably known early on Thursday. The campaign has been overshadowed by concerns of fraud and violence, and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan says there have been “blatant” attempts to manipulate the polls.
