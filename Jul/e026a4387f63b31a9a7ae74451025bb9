A legal practitioner has accused the police of arresting and detaining his client, a second class chief from Ada-Opokwu of Opokwu LGA, Benue State over a civil matter concerning debt recovery. The lawyer, Emeka Obegolu in a petition to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Inspector General of Police (IGP), said his client, Chief George Ali was arrested and detained over a loan of $100,000 obtained by his brother Anthony Ali sometime in 2007 from their kinsman Air Vice Marshal Emmanuel Ejeh (rtd). Obegolu said the detention of his client was unlawful and an abuse of his fundamental human rights saying it is unconstitutional for the police “to attempt to forcefully recover debts between two business partners,” and as such a fundamental rights suit was filed before an FCT High Court.
