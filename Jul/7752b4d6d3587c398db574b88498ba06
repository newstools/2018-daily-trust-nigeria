Corporate bodies, philanthropists and residents have been urged to ​join​ global voices for the improvement of the lives of women and girls through education, empowerment and enabling opportunities. The president of Soroptimist International Abuja, Mrs Esther John Audu, who made the call during her investiture as the club’s 15th president on Saturday, said residents should always render volunteer services to humanity in order to make the world a better place. The former  ​Nigeria’s ​ ambassador to The Gambia, urged residents  ​to  participate, help, be kind, live to forget and forgive at all times. “We are women at our best in our communities, as we are international volunteers who use our collective power to provide for women and girls with resources, training and career support. I must let you know that you all belong here and are here to join us in volunteer services to humanity,” she said. Career support for girls, education, environmental sustainability and economic empowerment were included in her nine-point agenda ​which she promised to pursue vigorously during her two-year tenure as president.​ In her welcome remarks, the club’s immediate past president,  Mrs Gloria Iveren Bai, said the club was bound for greater heights with the assumption of Mrs Audu as leader.
