The Bureau for Interfaith, a Kaduna State Government agency for the promotion of religious harmony, is proposing a restriction on the conversion of minors who are below age 18. Director General of the bureau, Engr. Namadi Musa, who spoke at dialogue organized by the Kaduna Peace Commission yesterday, said the restriction is aimed at reducing inter-religious crisis in the state. He said the state has of recent been witnessing threats of violence due to cases of alleged conversion of minors by adults. The DG recalled a recent crisis in Kasuwan Magani town which resulted in the killings and burning of many houses that had to do with the alleged conversion of a lady. He said very recently similar crises were averted in Kubau and Kauru towns in Kaduna State where a Christian man impregnated a Muslim girl and wanted to marry her and a Christian lady moved out of her husband’s house wanting to marry a Muslim. “Our bureau has produced a template that if somebody wants to convert and is below 18, we can intervene to avert crisis,” he said. He said even if the person is above 18, the process should be such that all the parties concerned would have a sense of justice at the end. Executive Vice Chairman of the Kaduna Peace Commission, Mrs. Priscila Ankut said the role of religious leaders in peaceful coexistence cannot be overemphasized. She said it was in the process of looking at ways to ensure that Kaduna State is crisis free that the commission thought it wise to invite religious leaders to talk with them on the best approach towards peaceful coexistence. Secretary of Jamaatu Nasir Islam in Kaduna State, Malam Ibrahim Kufaina said one of the reasons crisis keep occurring is because people take different positions from what they resolve at meetings. He encouraged religious leaders to cooperate towards the sustenance of peace as nobody benefits from crisis.
