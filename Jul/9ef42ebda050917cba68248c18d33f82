Two hundred and seventeen temporary shops were burnt at the Jos Terminus Main Market of Jos-North Local Government area of Plateau State in the early hours of Saturday. The Police Commissioner in the state, Mr. Undie Adie, who visited the market to assess the damage caused by the fire, told journalists that the fire started at about 1:30am. Mr. Adie said when the fire started the DPO in charge of the area promptly alerted him and equally alerted the fire service men. The Commissioner added that the cause of the fire was still unknown, adding that his command was liaising with the fire service team to find out what triggered it. He said his officers and the Special Task-Force unit were able to cordon off the area to avert looting. “And few of the things we salvaged were secured at the police post. We are liaising with the chairman of the market so that we can identify those who suffered losses,” he said. The Management Committee Chairman of Jos-North Local Government Area, Dr Philip Nyang, commiserated with the traders who lost their valuables.
