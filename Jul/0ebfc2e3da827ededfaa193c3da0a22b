The Nigerian Air Force said it now has the capacity to repair its aircraft. The Air Force said it completed the in-house life extension programme on one of its C-130H aircraft, NAF 913 thereby improving the airlift capability of the force. The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, said NAF would continue to intensify efforts at reactivating unserviceable aircraft in its inventory to enhance operational effectiveness. A statement by Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya, the Director of Public Relations and Information,  said the CAS stated this while assessing the progress of work on the in-country Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM) of another NAF’s C-130 aircraft at 631 Aircraft Maintenance Depot (ACMD) during his operational visit to Lagos. The CAS, who was accompanied on the operational visit by senior officers from NAF Headquarters, also inspected and commissioned some projects at the Sam Ethnan Air Force Base (SEAFB) Ikeja and the Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (AFRC) Oshodi. At 631 ACMD, the CAS was briefed by the Commander, Air Commodore Moses Onilede, that the Depot had also successfully overhauled two C-130H aircraft engines while the in-country PDM of the second C-130H, NAF 917, had reached an advanced stage. Air Marshal Abubakar noted that the reactivation of NAF 913 was another major feat recorded by the current NAF leadership to further improve NAF’s capability to provide logistics support across multiple theatres of operations.
