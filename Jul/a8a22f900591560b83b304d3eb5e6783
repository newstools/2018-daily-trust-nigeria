The police in Lagos have identified routes at the popular Oyingbo and Ido markets in Ebute-Meta used by drug barons for the illegal distribution of fake and controlled drugs to other parts of the country. The police had consequently arrested three suspects - Lukmon Owolabi, 47; Lanre Maduvie, 55; and Aliu Usman, 60  -  whom a police source described as known drug traffickers. Various controlled drugs worth about N50 million were said to have been recovered from the suspects. At the time of the arrests, the recovered drugs were said to have been packaged and ready to be transported out of Lagos. The source said the drugs recovered from the suspects included four cartons of Tramadol, five cartons of Analgin injection, four cartons of Amcloxin capsules and three cartons of Lumartem capsules. Daily Trust gathered that detectives, working on an intelligence report, flagged down a Fiat Ducarto bus registration number FKJ 303 XQ loaded with substances suspected to be hard drugs and arrested the suspects. The police in the state, it was learnt, were finding the consumption of drugs like Tramadol, Codeine and Benylin by young persons as alarming.
