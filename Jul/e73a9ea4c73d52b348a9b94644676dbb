A senatorial aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT in 2019 election, Hajiya Heebat Ireti Kingibe, has said that the people of the territory need  credible and committed representation at the National Assembly. Kingibe, while speaking at her formal declaration to contest for the FCT Senate seat at the state APC secretariat in Abuja, yesterday, called on the people of the territory to ensure they elect those who would champion their cause at the Senate, House of Representatives and at the area councils level in 2019 elections. She also said there was need for all past excos, leaders and stalwarts to work hard to ensure APC won all elective positions across the six area councils. “It is through commitment that people of the FCT will enjoy the dividends of democracy and we can  also go on empowering the women and youth of the FCT, “ she said. Also speaking, the FCT chapter chairman of the APC, Alhaji Abdulmalik Usman, said the population of people in the FCT was over six million, with not less than two million voters in the territory. He noted that during INEC’s last stakeholders meeting in Abuja, over 267,000 PVCs were not collected. He therefore, called on eligible voters across the FCT including members and supporters of the party to collect their PVCs to vote in the 2019 election. “To this end, we are calling on our members and supporters to go and collect their PVCs so that we shall take over all elective positions at all levels in 2019,” he said.
