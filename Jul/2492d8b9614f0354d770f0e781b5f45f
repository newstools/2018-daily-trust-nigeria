The Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina has said the President has no hand in the drama at Benue State House of Assembly.

He said Buhari who is currently attending the ECOWAS/ECCAS Summit in Togo could not possibly be responsible for an internal squabble between two arms of government in Benue State.

“Statements have been issued by different interest groups, insinuating that the President may have a hand in the development in Benue," he said in a statement on Tuesday.

"This is paranoia at its worst, coming from people who have wittingly positioned themselves against the clean-up of the country, and the way we do things.

“President Buhari will never be part of any unconstitutional act, and any attempt to link him with the inglorious past, when minority number of lawmakers impeached governors, will not stick.”

Senate President, Bukola Saraki, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, had issued a joint statement on Monday, condemning the reported commencement of impeachment proceedings against Governor Samuel Ortom by a minority group in the State’s assembly.
