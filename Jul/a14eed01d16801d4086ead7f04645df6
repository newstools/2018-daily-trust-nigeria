The Ona of Abaji, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has decried the porous security at the Federal Government Girls College (FGGC) in the area. He made the remark at the valedictory service of the graduation ceremony of the students of the college on Saturday, in which 194 students including one of the daughters of the traditional ruler also graduated. He said he was concerned about lack of tight security at the college and that prompted him to invite the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) CSP Tersoo Tile, to join him to attend the graduation ceremony. “What I am disturbed about this school is security. Security of this school is not tight, that is why I invited the DPO here so that he can explain to us how we are going to improve security in this school,” he said. The traditional ruler congratulated the graduating students and urged them to be good ambassadors in the tertiary institutions they will find themselves. In her speech, the college principal, Mrs. Sodangi J. Binta, commended the contribution of the Federal Ministry of Education for providing the college with the required manpower and facilities to operate. The principal also lauded the efforts of the School Based Management Committee (SBC), under the leadership of Dr. Hassan Suleiman, for its efforts towards the development of the college. “And to my graduands, as you take the next step on the ladder of success, I urge you to remain focused in all your undertakings,” she said.
