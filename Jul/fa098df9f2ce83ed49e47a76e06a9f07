Suspected hoodlums yesterday pelted the convoy of Plateau State governor, Simon Bako Lalong, after he visited an Internally Displaced Person’s (IDP) camp at Anguldi in Jos-South Local Government Area of the State. Daily Trust on Sunday gathered that Lalong who visited the camp alongside the deputy governor,  Prof. Sonni Tyoden, Secretary to the State Government, Rufus Bature and other government officials had a  conversation with Berom traditional leaders and the displaced persons. The state Commissioner of Information, Yakubu Dati, had earlier stated that Lalong assured the IDPs of his administration’s commitment to their welfare. However, shortly after the governor’s convoy left the camp, a witness told our correspondent that some youths converged around Zawan and pelted the convoy with stones. “The youths were incited, some of them are not from here (Zawan area) they came in their numbers and began to throw stones at the convoy of the governor, this is purely political,” he said. The Commissioner for Information, Dati was unavailable to comments but the member representing Jos-north in the state House of Assembly, Ibrahim Baba Hassan, urged security agencies to fish out the hoodlums and their sponsors. Baba Hassan said, “we all know it was sponsored. It is unfortunate that at a time governor Lalong is trying to unite the people, some selfish politicians are sponsoring youths to attack his convoy.”
