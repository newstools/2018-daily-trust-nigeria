The Federal Government has said it would remodel the Federal Secretariat, Abuja through Public Private Partnership (PPP) to ensure safety of staff and boost productivity.

The Head of Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF), Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita, who made the announcement today in Abuja, also said that the scheme is a pilot and would be extended to other federal secretariats in the country after it, would have been accepted by the authority.

She spoke while signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Pilot PPP with Alpha Mead Development Company Limited and that the MoU is to enable the company remodel the ground floor and the car parking lots of block ‘A’ Federal Secretariat Complex, Phase II.

According to her, the facilities in the secretariat have deteriorated over the years due to lack of maintenance while others have become obsolete and that the state of the building was no longer conducive for workers, hence the partnership to give the complex a face lift.

“For years we have been seeking for funds to work on the secretariat, so we decided to think out of the box and go into PPP, to resuscitate the federal secretariat. 

"Everyday members of staff come to offices that are in a deplorable state. If you give Staff a good working environment, they would be encouraged to put in their best. This is a pilot project, if we are able to succeed in this we will expand the project to all the phases of the secretariat,” Oyo-Ita said.
