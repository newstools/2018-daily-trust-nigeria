The director and proprietor of Islamic Leadership Academy, Kuje, Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, has named one of the girls’ hostels in the school after Barrister Firdausi Aljannah Amasa who was recently called to the bar after she was earlier denied for using hijab. Muhammad said the victory of Firdausi is an emancipation of female lawyers with regards to the use of hijab in the country. Muhammad, who was speaking during the graduation of 152 students of the school, said the students were unique because they had successfully learnt the recitation of the Qur’an in it’s entirely. The school’s proprietor appealed to parents to intensify efforts towards paying the school fees of their children, while thanking the Parent’s Teachers Association (PTA) for their support towards the academic success of the school. The principal, Mrs Ganiyat Adigun, said the students have been prepared for the future, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. She urged the graduating students to see their graduation as the beginning of a new page in their lives as they move into the larger and bigger world where challenges are quite enormous.
