President Muhammadu Buhari has  called on nations where looted assets  have been stashed to release them without the usually long technicalities  involved in the process of reptriation. Buhari, according to a statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, made the call in Nouakchott, Mauritania, yesterday during his introductory remarks as the leader of the African Union theme of the year, Winning the Fight against Corruption, A Sustainable Path to Africas Transformation shortly before the commencement of the debate on the African Anti-Corruption Year. President Buhari also appraised the anti-corruption efforts so far: “During the last 6 months, we have engaged in multi-sectoral dialogue with a broad range of actors including parliamentarians, national anti-corruption agencies, civil society, media, youth and women groups and development partners. We have convened three different regional Consultative Workshops in line with my campaign programme in an effort to sensitize our people on the evil effects of corruption on our societies. He also informed the gathering of his intention to partner with the AU Chairperson to further push the frontiers of the anti-corruption battle. Buhari called on other member states yet to ratify the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption to take all measures to sign and ratify it.
