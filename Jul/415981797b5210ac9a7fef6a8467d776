Osun State Governor, Mr Rauf Aregbesola has described the death of the former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and former Finance Minister, Mallam Adamu Ciroma as a huge loss to the nation. Aregbesola said the former Managing Director of the New Nigerian Newspapers was an astute politician and one of the respectable political voices in Northern Nigeria. The Governor who spoke through his Media Adviser, Mr. Sola Fasure in Osogbo, capital of Osun State on Thursday lamented that the death of Ciroma was painful. Aregbesola said Ciroma as a politician had been around for long and in the service of the country in numerous capacities both at the state and national level. Governor Aregbesola described him as a ‘principled politician’ and recalled that Ciroma supported June 12, 1993 Presidential Election won by Basorun Moshood Abiola, arguing that Abiola 'won fair and square' and should be sworn in. Aregbesola stated that history would be kind to Mallam Ciroma for taking this position. "The death of Mallam Adamu Ciroma came to me as a rude shock," he said.
