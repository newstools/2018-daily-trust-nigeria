A Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday granted an application by the Deputy Governor of Imo State, Prince Eze Madumere, to halt impeachment proceedings against him by the state House of Assembly. The House had on Tuesday, set up a six-member committee headed by the member representing Obowo LGA, Kennedy Ibe, to probe allegations of misconduct against Mr Madumere and report back to it within seven days. However, the committee submitted its report about 48 hours later on Thursday and concluded that Madumere had a case to answer. The House subsequently on Thursday served a notice of impeachment on the deputy governor asking him to defend himself against the allegations against him. But Madumere, through his Chief Press Secretary,Â  Uche Onwuchekwa, said he was not properly served the notice, after Onwuchekwa had Wednesday refuted the allegations as baseless. The deputy governor thereafter took the lawmakers and the state chief judge before the court in Abuja.
