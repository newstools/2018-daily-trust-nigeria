The Nigerian Union of Pensioners, New Nigerian Newspaper branch, has decried the non-payment of its members’ monthly pension and accrued pension arrears. The Secretary of the union, Albert Bosa Iweka, yesterday said over 180 pensioners died within six years while waiting for their entitlements. He said the pensioners were owed 15years pension arrears. He said the pensioners were yet to be paid despite President Muhammadu Buhari’s approval of N2.1billion in February 2017. “The reason for non-payment of the pension is best known to the Federal Ministry of Finance which has bluntly refused to release the fund. This is in spite of a subsisting court judgment delivered on October 28, 2013 directing the federal government and the New Nigerian Newspaper to pay the outstanding arrears and monthly pension of the retirees which informed the approval of N2.1billion by the President,” he said.
