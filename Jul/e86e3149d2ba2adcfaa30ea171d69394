Senate President Bukola Saraki has told President Muhammadu Buhari that governors and ministers are sponsoring protest against the National Assembly. Saraki said this during plenary while speaking on the protest staged at the entrance to the National Assembly over the ‘’Padding of the 2018 budget” and constituency projects. “For Nigerians being used - people are taking advantage of the poverty in the country and what is saddening about it is that those who are doing this are those who are part of government.  This does not help the unity of the arms of government. “ Mr President needs to investigate this and call to order - there is no secret in this, if you go out there those boys will tell you where they are collecting the money from, the minister giving them the money, the governor that is giving them the money and these are governors, ministers in the same ruling party,” he said. Saraki called on those sponsoring the protest should desist, saying “We know who you are, it is not in the interest of the unity of this country.” He insisted that the constituency projects were conceived to ensure equitable distribution of the country’s resources. Saraki’s remarks followed a point of order by Senator Barnabas Gemade (APC, Benue) on the protest. Gemade, while condemning the call for the discontinuation of the constituency projects said the N100 billion allocated it translated to less than 1 percent of the federal budget.
