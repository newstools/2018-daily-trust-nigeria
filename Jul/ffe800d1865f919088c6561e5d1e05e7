Equatorial Guinea’s president has declared a general amnesty for all political prisoners. President Teodoro Obiang Nguema’s decree was read on national television. Opposition parties had demanded the release of political detainees as one of the conditions for taking part in what the president has called a national dialogue. Earlier this year, Equatorial Guinea’s main opposition party Citizens for Innovation was dissolved by the authorities and 21 of its members were given long jail sentences following what the government said was a coup attempt by mercenaries. Mr Obiang seized power in a coup in 1979.
