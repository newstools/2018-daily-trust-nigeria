Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State said Nigeria needs more leaders with courage and integrity as the late politician, Malam Adamu Ciroma. Dickson said this yesterday at the Abuja residence of deceased during a condolence to the family. Ciroma, a former Minister of Finance, died on Thursday in Abuja at 84, and has since been buried according to Islamic rites. Dickson said Nigeria needed leaders of integrity who would dedicate their lives to the service and well-being of citizens as Ciroma did in his life. “Late Malam Ciroma was a man that gave so much to the service of the country and humanity. “God has called him and he is gone, but there is no doubt that he did his best for our country. “The lesson that we must all learn from his sterling life is selfless service to the nation and his ability to say no, when “no’’ is the right answer. “The deceased lived the life of integrity without assuming he was the only one with integrity. All of us see him as an icon to emulate. “Our nation is poorer at his departure, especially at this critical time when we need many more leaders with honour and courage who believe in the possibility and potential of a united, strong democratic Nigeria.’’ Dickson, who described Ciroma as a quintessential Nigerian in all respects, said his loss was not just to his family but to the country.
