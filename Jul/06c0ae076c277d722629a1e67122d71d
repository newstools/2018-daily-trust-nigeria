A chieftain of Accord Party (APC) and former presidential spokesman, Dr. Doyin Okupe, has advised the Senate president, Dr. Bukola Saraki, to leverage on his increasing popularity and contest the 2019 presidential election. Okupe stated this on a Channels TV programme, Sunrise Daily, yesterday, while analysing the purported APC crisis occasioned by the recent breakaway of rAPC. According to him, “Apart from Buhari, the next most visible and most notable politician in Nigeria today is Bukola Saraki and he would do himself a great favour if he steps into the ring and run for the position of president; he has the pedigree. “Saraki has had the required exposure and experience from being a special assistant to the president to being a two-term governor and now Senate president. He has been through different stages of leadership and this makes him stand out among many other aspirants who have indicated interest to become president,” he said. Asked about the possibility of Saraki clinching the APC presidential ticket against President Buhari who had also indicated interest to run for a second term on the platform of the same party, Okupe said, “APC would be doing themselves a favour if they do not allow the president to run. And I don’t see Saraki contesting primaries in the APC; it is impossible, the hostility against him in the APC is too much, that is why he needs to move to another party where he can form alliance with other parties to contest. “Take for instance, Buhari had about two million votes from the middle belt, now per cent of that is gone,” he claimed.
