President Muhammadu Buhari,  who will depart for the Netherlands today, has urged  Dr. John Kayode  Fayemi, the winner of the Ekiti State governorship election, to be  magnanimous in victory . In a message of congratulations to the governor-elect, Buhari described the election as ‘hard fought’. In the statement by Femi  Adesina, the media special adviser,  Buhari commended the All  Progressives Congress (APC) governor-elect and all party supporters for  the hard-fought victory after a dignified campaign. President Buhari urged  Fayemi  and APC members to be magnanimous in victory as the incoming  administration prepares to unfold a new lease of life for the people of  Ekiti State through purposeful and responsible governance.  He commended the people of  the State for their matured and peaceful conduct as they made their  choice using the power of the ballot. President Buhari also  lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for adequate  preparations and displaying impartiality throughout the process. He applauded the security  agencies for creating the right atmosphere for the relatively peaceful  conduct of the polls and urges them to sustain the peace. He also commended local and  international observers and monitors for their vigilance and  contributions towards the relatively hitch-free exercise. The President urged  the  losers to be gallant in conceding defeat and to use constitutional means  to settle whatever grievances they may have rather than resort to  self-help. President Buhari appealed  to all stakeholders in Ekiti State to work towards a successful  transition to a new administration in the higher interest of not only  the State but the entire nation and its fledgling democratic experience. “In all this, the people of Ekiti State have spoken loud and clear, and democracy has won again,” the President noted.
