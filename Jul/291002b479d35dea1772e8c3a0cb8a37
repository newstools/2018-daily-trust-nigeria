  The joint National Assembly Committee on Land transport is not convinced that the December deadline for the completion of the 156-kilometer Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge is feasible.  Members of the Senate and House of Representatives who inspected the project Friday said the deadline set aside by the Federal Government is doubtful.  Chairman of the Senate Committee on Land Transport, Senator Gbenga Ashafa who addressed newsmen at the inspection disclosed that the contractor has asked for an extension of the project delivery timeline.  "After all said and done, after the inspection today, I can say categorically that the December 2018 deadline won't be a reality. This is understandable giving the quality of job that is being done.  â€œI have been told that the contractor handling the project, the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) has made request that the deadline of the project be extended to around middle of 2019.
