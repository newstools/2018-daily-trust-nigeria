The lingering crisis between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC) and Federation Account Allocation Committee ( FAAC) over revenue remittances may have been resolved as president Buhari was ordered a new remittance template. The Minister of finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, said yesterday at the monthly Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting that the new approach would put end to recurring stand-offs between FAAC and NNPC over revenue remittance. “I have an update on the intervention of Mr President on the FAAC  stand-off . The last FAAC as you know was inconclusive and the accounts proposed were not accepted by FAAC. Mr President asked to be briefed on the issue and based  on that written briefing, Mr President asked for further information which was provided by both ourselves and NNPC.  Last week, on Friday he held a meeting between myself, the Chief of  Staff, the Minister of state for petroleum and the NNPC team”. “Mr President gave directives. The one which relates to FAAC was the need to revise the template. It was accepted that the reporting template between NNPC and the Federation account was not fit for purpose and not providing the right level of assurance around the figures. And so Mr President has directed that a new template be generated jointly between the ministry of finance, the office of the Accountant-General, the NNPC and the RMAFC” she said. “Mr President has directed that prior to FAAC, there must be a pre-meeting between the Ministry of Finance and the NNPC to go through the figures that are being presented and to agree on those figures before they are brought to FAAC”, she said . Meanwhile, N821.863 billion was shared  as revenue for the month of June, 2018, among the federal, states and local government areas.
