The Nigerian Union of journalists (NUJ) has expressed worry over the dangerous dimension the wanton killings and destruction of property are taking in the country while commiserating with Plateau State over the recent killings in the state. It urged the Federal Government to immediately review and overhaul the security architecture of the country. This was contained in a communiqué signed by NUJ’s National Secretary, Shuaibu Usman Leman and issued at the end of its National Executive Council meeting held in Sokoto. It frowned at purveyors of fake news on various social media platforms and warned that mainstream media professionals should be more thorough and circumspect in their work to avoid being used to promote hate speech and other divisive tendencies. “The union calls on the Federal Government to immediately charge Jones Abiri, publisher of Weekly Source Magazine to court to enable him defend himself of whatever crime he allegedly committed or release him unconditionally. Jones Abiri was picked up in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State by the Department of State Security and is being detained for nearly two years now,” the communiqué said. The union, which condemned previous attacks on journalists covering elections in Ekiti State, said it would not condone any acts of impunity against Journalists in the country. The communiqué also appealed to media stakeholders to convene a meeting to recommend an enhanced media salary structure for professionals in the sector.
