Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote has revealed he needs a wife.   The Business mogul who disclosed this in an interview with Financial Times noted that his busy schedule would not limit him from finding a companion again. The father of three daughters, who has been divorced twice, explained that he was not getting any younger and is willing to take on a wife. His words: “I’m not getting younger. Sixty years is no joke. But it doesn’t make sense to go out and get somebody if you don’t have the time. Right now, things are really, really very busy, because we have the refinery,, we have the petrochemicals, we have the fertilizer, we have the gas pipeline” The 61-year-old however, admitted the need to calm down and find true love.
