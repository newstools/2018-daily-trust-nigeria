The Director of Finance, Ise/Orun Local Government in Ekiti State, Mr Michael Kayode Bamisaye, has allegedly committed suicide by jumping into the well at his residence in Ado-Ekiti. Daily Trust gathered that Bamisaye, who had reportedly drunk water mixed with cement, jumped into the well in his compound located behind Tinuola Maximum School, off Afao Road, Ado-Ekiti. Though the cause of the suicide could not be immediately established, a report said the director had once attempted to kill himself. A source said, “The deceased woke up at about 4am to assist his wife to do some house chores and even called some council workers he used to convey to Ise every day to be ready to join him to their station. “All of a sudden, he disappeared and his wife went outside looking for him. Later she discovered that the well was open and saw his body floating. The wife and other people who joined in the search later saw the cement he had mixed with water, which was presumed he might have taken before taking the plunge into the well.” The men of the State Fire Service had deposited the corpse at the mortuary. The Police Public Relations Officer Mr. Caleb Ikechukwu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, was not available for comment as his phone indicated it had been switched off.
