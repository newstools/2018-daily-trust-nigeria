Operation Safe Haven, the multi-security taskforce maintaining law and order in Plateau State has paraded 10 suspected criminals for various offences including gun running, cattle rustling, armed robber, impersonation and illegal possession of fire arms.  Among the suspects paraded was a Police sergeant arrested for gun running.

Major Umar also explained that Patrick Choji and Yakubu Davou were found in possession of fire arms while Sani Haruna was arrested for impersonation. He said the suspects were arrested in Jos north, Jos south, Barkin Ladi and Nasarawa State.  However, Daily Trust gathered from an intelligence officer attached to the STF that Sgt that John was a Mobile Police officer attached to the Counter Terrorism Unit in Maiduguri. He was said to have sold 182 rounds of 7.62 mm special armor used for AK47 at the rate of N450 each to one Sani Mohammed. He said Men of the taskforce had used Sani who has been in their custody to lure Sgt. John with the intention of supplying the special armor to him and after the negotiations, security agents had swooped in and arrested John. Major Umar said the police sergeant was giving important information to get other likely members of the syndicate while adding that the suspected cattle rustler was arrested in Nasarawa state with three of the rustled cows from Fan village in Barkin Ladi. He said investigations after the arrest of the conveyor led to the arrest of the buyer who was on a wheel chair.
