Police detectives attached to the Anti-Cultism unit of Lagos State Command have arrested about 40 female cult gang-members during initiation in the state. The suspects, mostly between 14 and 18 years of age, have been living under bridges in the metropolis. A cult group, known as Black Axe, had embarked on recruitment of female members and had planned that day for their initiation. It was gathered that the suspects had gathered under the guise of celebrating birthday, unknown to them that they were being initiated. Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, said the girls were rounded up while others escaped. He said the police recovered one big banner written 07 with Black Axe logo, three litres of liquid substance suspected to be Skuchies- substance mix with drugs, one big clay pot, two small calabashes and one locally made cut to size pistol and others. He said the suspects will be profiled and charged to court after the conclusion of investigations.
