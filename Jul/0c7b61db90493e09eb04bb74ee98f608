The first footage has emerged from the hospital where 12 Thai boys and their coach are being treated after their dramatic rescue from a flooded cave. Several boys can be seen in facemasks and hospital gowns, at least one giving a victory sign for the camera. Meanwhile, reports say the boys and the coach were sedated to stop them panicking during the dangerous rescue. The Thai Navy Seals also released new video showing the three-day rescue operation that captivated the world. Divers who took part in the operation said the boys were heavily sedated to avoid anxiety as they went through the dark, narrow, underwater passageways. Former Navy seal Chaiyananta Peeranarong told AFP news agency: “Some of them were asleep, and some of them were wiggling their fingers, kind of groggy - but they were breathing. My job was to transfer them along.”
