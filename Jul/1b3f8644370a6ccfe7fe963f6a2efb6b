Edo State Commissioner for Health Dr David Osifo yesterday said there were new cases of Lassa fever in Esan North-East, Esan Central, Etsako East and other local government areas. Addressing journalists in Benin, he asked residents to sustain preventive measures against the epidemic. “People should protect their foodstuffs and water from rats through storage in well covered containers. Avoid bush burning that can drive rats into people’s homes from the surrounding bush. The environment and homes where people live should be clean always. “Residents in the state should avoid eating raw food that not properly stored in covered containers. If possible, people should suspend the drinking of garri,” the commissioner said. Osifo also asked residents to report suspected cases of the disease by to the appropriate authorities.
