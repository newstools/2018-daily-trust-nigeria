A 27-year-old man, Olayemi Adeoye, who the police said has a notoriety for stealing of Honda CRV and jeeps, was rearrested yesterday by the police in Ondo State while attempting to steal a jeep. The suspect had been arrested and charged to court for a similar offence in the past. Adeoye and two others were paraded before journalists yesterday at the Ondo State police command headquarters, Igbatoro road, Akure. Addressing journalists on behalf of the Commissioner of Police Gbenga Adeyanju, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for the command, Mr Femi Joseph said the suspect was rearrested on July 12 4pm at the Shasha Area, Akure, while attempting to steal a Toyota Corolla car with registration number SS 719 AAA belonging to one Mr Olanipekun of Oba-Ile Estate. The vehicle, according to Joseph, was being driven by the wife of the owner when the suspect accosted her. The police spokesman said that on interrogation, Adeoye confessed to be a specialist in stealing Honda CRV and jeep cars in the state. He said the suspect’s method was to go to where any vehicle was parked and use his master key to open any car. “He would just go in there, switch on and go away with it. But luck ran against him a few weeks ago at the Shasha area, Akure, when he wanted to steal a jeep that belongs to one Mr. Olanipekun. “The police quickly arrested him and took him to our office and while interrogating him, he confessed to the theft of numerous vehicles with his master key. “He has once been arrested by the anti-kidnapping squad, not for kidnapping but for stealing. But we were always shocked to see him on the streets again.”
