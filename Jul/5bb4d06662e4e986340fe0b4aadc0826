The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has reiterated its commitment to making Nigerian roads among the top twenty safest roads in the world by the year 2020. This was encapsulated in its perspective for the vision 2020:20 of the Federal Government of Nigeria. The Corps Marshal FRSC, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi mentioned this during a paper presentation on ‘ Road Traffic Crash Trend in Nigeria’ at the 2018 Annual training workshop of the Nigerian Motoring Journalists Association held in Lagos. According to the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, Oyeyemi stated that the pace of technological advancement especially in the automobile world has enhanced man’s mobility as well as posed serious concerns on human safety. “Due to access of automobile by unqualified persons, the world’s roads including that of Nigeria have become increasingly dangerous to travel on throughout history” he said. Oyeyemi further stated that “Nigeria like other sub-Sahara Africa nations have been hardly hit by road traffic crashes. The overall effect of which is largely preventable has impacted negatively on productive manpower, economy and the socio-political sectors of the country. “Despite massive global awareness of the road traffic crash problem, forecast show that the trend could soar if nothing is done to reverse the present situation.”  He added. Kazeem also quoted the Corps marshal saying that before the establishment of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Nigeria’s roads were rated the worst next to Ethiopia. The Nigerian Government took steps to reverse the trend through institutional arrangements and policies like; Establishment of National Road Safety Commission (NRSC) in 1974. Establishment of Oyo State Road Safety Corps 1977, and Establishment of Federal Road Safety Commission on 18 Febuary, 1988 all geared towards eradicating the menace of road traffic crash.
