The Chief of Staff to the Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State,Â  Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola, has won the ticket of the All Progressive Congress (APC) for the September 22 governorship election in the state. Oyetola defeated other aspirants with a wide margin in all local government areas where the direct primary election was held. The result was announced late last night by the chairman of the electoral panel, Governor Abdulazeez Yari of Zamfara State. One of the aspirants, an Osogbo-born lawyer, Mr Rasheed Kunle Adegoke, participated in the election and lamented that it was manipulated in favour of Oyetola. He vowed to challenge the result in court. The Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, withdrew from the race as he accused the party leadership of manipulating the exercise. He assured his supporters that he would still contest and win the governorship election.
