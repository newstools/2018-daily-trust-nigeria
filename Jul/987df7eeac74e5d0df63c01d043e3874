President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday rejected a bill passed by the National Assembly over misspelling of the word substituting. The President’s letter was read by Senate President Bukola Saraki during yesterday’s plenary session. He observed that in spelling the word substituting, the National Assembly wrote ‘substittuting’. The bill for Radiographers Registration (Amendment) was rejected over two issues, the misspelling and the expansion of the persons covered by the draft law. In the President’s letter, there was also a gaffe as the date the President claimed to have taken the action contradicted when the letter was written. The letter was dated June 18, 2018, received on July 4, 2018 at the Senate and the President said he took the decision to reject the bill on June 26. The letter reads: “ Pursuant to section 58 (4) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, I hereby convey to the senate my decision on the 26th June 2018 to decline the presidential assent to the Radiographers Registration Amendment Bill recently passed by the National Assembly. “This is due to the expansion of the scope of ‘persons’ covered by the bill which we are concerned would create disharmony in the health sector between radiographers and radiologists who are regulated separately. “I also note that there is a minor error in section 2 (a) of the amendment bill where the word substituting is misspelt as ‘substittuting’. Please accept, distinguished Senate President, the assurances of my highest consideration,” he said. Our correspondent reports that the President rejected the bill three months after he rejected the controversial amendment made to the electoral act.
