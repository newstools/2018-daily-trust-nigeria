The 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos) have faulted a recent performance directive of the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and a N72 billion funding from the ministry to improve networks. Addressing newsmen in Abuja on Tuesday, the DisCos' group, Association of Nigeria Electricity Distributors (ANED) raised salient questions on the N72bn funding. It said the DisCos were not consulted by the Ministry and that the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) procuring the distribution projects was a mere market participant whom the DisCos are not answerable to for repayment.  “Why is the government seeking to utilize taxpayer funds for projects that are within the purview of privately-owned companies rather than addressing the challenges that will enable the DisCos access debt financing?”, queried Mr Sunday Oduntan, ANED Director, Research and Advocacy. Fashola had last week charged NERC to deepen Xits enforcement on the DisCos to perform their metering and network improvement obligations.  The DisCos however in their response said NERC altered their metering plans by initiating Meter Assets Providers (MAP) regulations in April and has delayed it till October 2018.  The minister also accused the DisCos of frustrating full disbursement of a N213bn CBN loan for operators. The Daily Trust reports that as at May 2018, Yola DisCo (managed by FG’s Bureau of Public Enterprises, BPE) and Kaduna DisCo have not completed paper works to draw from the fund.  Responding, Oduntan said, “We are not aware of any DisCos that have sought to reject the NEMSF funds or gone to court to frustrate the disbursement.”  They noted that the Minister may have mistaken it for a DisCos’ injunction in 2017 against attempts to re-nationalize the DisCos by NERC and NBET, seeking to escrow DisCo revenue accounts.  On metering, ANED said the DisCos had the obligation to meter 1.7 million customers within five years after the 2013 privatisation. “The gap exceeds the 1.7m metering obligation specified in the DisCos’ performance agreement (out of which the Discos have delivered 88 per cent of their metering obligation),” Oduntan said.  ANED claimed that metering would gulp N299bn in five years but NERC only allows the 11 DisCos to use N305bn market revenue during the period to provide meters, transformers among other investments which caused the huge gap.  “With the responsibility of metering given to third party vendors under MAP regulation by NERC, it is our hope that the challenges of estimated billing will be minimized for our customers over time,” the DisCos’ group said.
