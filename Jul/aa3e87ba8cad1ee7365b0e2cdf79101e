A panel that investigated the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) said it uncovered fraud in the financial state of the fund. The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige received the report of the Administrative Panel of Enquiry yesterday. The panel said it discovered fraud running into billions of naira. Submitting the report yesterday, Chairman of the panel, Ishaya A. Awotu said the fund did not have operational manual to guide its financial activities, while compliance with the provisions of the Financial Regulations in carrying out its transactions was very weak. “Bank reconciliation of most of the bank accounts of the fund was not carried out. Without the reconciliation of the bank statements, irregular payments and fraud committed on the accounts cannot be detected. Furthermore, financial statements prepared from un-reconciled accounts cannot be reliable. Non-reconciliation of bank accounts violates section 716 of the Financial Regulations,” he said. Awotu said the panel discovered that there were several transfers of funds in between bank accounts without authorization and approvals. “The sum of N15.7 billion was transferred from one account to another. Evidences to show the approvals and payment vouchers authorizing the transfers were not presented to the panel. “The panel observed that the sum of N2.9bn was expended on computerization and other related ICT equipment. Despite this expenditure, not much was achieved on computerization of the fund defeating the purpose of the expenditure,” he said. The Minister had on February 15, 2017, constituted the panel to look into the financial state of affairs of NSITF. Receiving the report, Ngige described the document as a financial roadmap to a healthy NSITF and promised that an implementation committee would be set up to execute the recommendations.
