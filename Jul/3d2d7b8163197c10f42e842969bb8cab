The United States Embassy in Nigeria has urged Nigerians in respective of ethnicity, region or religion to emulate a septuagenarian Imam Abdullahi Abubakar who saved about 300 Christians from attackers in Nghar Yelwa village of Barkin Ladi local government of the Plateau state. The embassy made the call on Tuesday through its Charge de Affaires, Mr. David Young during a three-day Peace & Security Conference organized by the Plateau State Peace Building Agency holding at Crest Hotel in Jos. Mr. Young explained that he has seen people who worked for peace, but didn’t see somebody who have put his life on the line to protect others in their communities like what Imam did by protecting the 300 Christians. He said, “Let’s what the Imam did to be a challenge for us, let’s us risk our lives for the peace.” Mr. Young added that the US Embassy in Nigeria and US Government condemned in the strong terms the killings in Plateau state, middle belt and across Nigeria. “The killing of innocent people is simply not acceptable, whether in Plateau, Zamfara, Benue or Barno or Taraba, we as a people of faith should submit ourselves to God,” he said. While calling on Nigerians to speak out for peace, not to take arms and condemned violence, Mr. Young charged the law enforcement agencies to arrest and to prosecute perpetrators of the attacks.
