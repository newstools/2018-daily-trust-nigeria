Officials of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) have organised a sensitisation campaign for original inhabitants in Garki chiefdom. The officials, along with other city managers, interacted with hundreds of stakeholders from Apo, Akpmajenya and Garki villages in order to pave way for a seamless resettlement exercise on the planned relocation of the people to Apo Resettlement site. This is coming against the backdrop of reinvigorated effort towards relocating original inhabitants of Garki chiefdom to Apo Resettlement area. The Director, FCDA Resettlement and Compensation Department, Alhaji Baba-Kura Umar, who led the delegation, said an expanded implementation committee was set up to ensure seamless relocation exercise. Umar disclosed that the government has since commenced issuance of letters of intent to the original inhabitants of Garki, warning that the document was not transferable. He said it was a continuous exercise and urged those affected to be patient as everyone would be carried along. Responding, the Saâ€™peyi of Garki, Alhaji Usman Nga-Kupi, who expressed satisfaction with the resettlement plan, thanked stakeholders for their cooperation in the process. He said the title document given to them was for their children and warned them against selling them, and avoid being shut out of the ongoing relocation scheme.
