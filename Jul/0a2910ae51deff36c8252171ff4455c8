President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said it was a thing of joy for Nigeria to help any African country in distress. He spoke while receiving the outgoing Sierra Leone High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mrs. Haja Afsatu Kabba, at the State House, in Abuja. Buhari said brotherly assistance extended to the West African country during the Ebola epidemic and the recent mudslide were the least Nigeria could do. “I congratulate your new president on his election, and believe that our long-standing relationship which dates back to almost 60 years will continue to flourish,” Buhari was quoted in a statement by his Special Adviser (Media & Publicity), Mr. Femi Adesina. He wished Mrs. Kabba, who spent two years in Nigeria, the best of luck in her next assignment. The outgoing envoy expressed gratitude to the government and people of Nigeria for the support, saying the good bilateral relations will continue.
