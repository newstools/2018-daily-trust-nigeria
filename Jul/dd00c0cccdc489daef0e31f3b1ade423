Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima, has declared that the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast is largely over. According to the governor, the current situation in the northeast is a cause for celebration. Shettima said though there might be some hiccups, the situation was better than it was about three years ago. The governor declared this on Tuesday while addressing State House correspondents after meeting the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari. Shettima said he was at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja over the forthcoming presidential visit to his state as well as the Army Day celebration. “The ongoing insurgency problem is largely over. We might be having some hiccups, but when you compared the past with the present, we have every cause to celebrate. “We have pockets of the insurgents in inlands around the Lake Chad and the Sambisa Forest, but when you juxtapose the sorry state of affairs three, four years ago and the current situation we are in, I think there is cause for celebration. “There is no cause for alarm," the governor stated.
