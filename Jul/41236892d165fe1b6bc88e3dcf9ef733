Bauchi State Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board (BCPWB) has sponsored 10 Christian clergies for the 2018 Easter pilgrimage. Executive Secretary of the Board, Mr Daniel Shawulu disclosed this in Bauchi on Tuesday during the screening of the intending pilgrims. Shawulu, who was represented by the Director of Administration and Human Resources of the Board, Mr Nathaniel Mua' azu, said the 10 clergymen were sponsored for the pilgrimage to pray for peace and unity in the country. "Today, we commenced screening of the ten clergies sponsored by the state government to the holy land to perform pilgrimage and pray for the nation. "The ten pastors are going for 2018 Easter pilgrimage to Israel on July 14," he said. He however explained that the Easter pilgrimage that was earlier slated for April 2018 was delayed due to some reasons. Shawulu said the clergymen would organise prayer convocations in Israel during the pilgrimage to pray for the peace and unity of the state and the nation. According to him, the pilgrimage was well organised and would be conducted in a way that will be sustainable. The Executive Secretary however commended the state government for sponsoring and supporting Christian clergies on prayer mission for the country to the pilgrimage. He stressed that all the pastors sponsored from the state possessed qualities such as integrity, credibility and are good Christian in the state. He further explained that the Board has introduced e-medical services and will organise a medical training and conduct examinations for interested doctors and nurses.â€Ž "Equal opportunities will be given to those that apply and want to participate in the medical activities of the pilgrims," he said Shawulu called on the clergy to conduct themselves well throughout their sojourn at the holy land.
