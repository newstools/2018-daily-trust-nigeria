The federal government said it will probe suspected human trafficking in the case of the 155 Nigerian football fans who were stranded in Russia after the World Cup tournament. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said the plan to probe the issue surrounding the incident was underway. The stranded Nigerians, who besieged the nation’s embassy in Moscow on July 12, were flown back to the country after President Muhammadu Buhari ordered their immediate evacuation. Onyeama said after a discussion with the Director General of National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Ms Julie Okah–Donli, it was clear that there were possible cases of human trafficking among the returnees. “I have spoken to the DG of NAPTIP and she had also indicated that they had sounded the alarm bells for these young children not to leave the country, that it had all the hallmarks of trafficking and irregular migration,” he said. The minister insisted that some of them, among whom was a nursing mother, were quite too young to have travelled to Russia by themselves solely for the purpose of the World Cup tournament. He added that an investigation would also be launched into an allegation that some travel agents cancelled the return tickets of the football fans without informing them, leaving them stranded in the European country.
