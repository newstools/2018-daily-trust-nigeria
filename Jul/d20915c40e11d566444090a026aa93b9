The National Chairman of Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN) Jay Samuels has said his party walked-out of the recent meeting where some political parties formed a united front ahead of the 2019 general election. He said the party dissociated itself from the coalition because the parties involved are led by “the same people we have committed to retiring.” At a meeting on Monday, leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with 37 other political parties on presenting a candidate that will slug it out with President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019. Addressing journalists during the ANN National Executive Council meeting in Abuja, Samuels said the coalition does not represent what the party stands for. “I wasn’t comfortable when I came into the room and saw the grandfathers, grand patrons of everything that is wrong politically with Nigeria. “So, it doesn’t stand with the party’s ideals of generational leadership change that will lead to building a new Nigeria we all can be proud of. I decided to take my leave,” he said.
