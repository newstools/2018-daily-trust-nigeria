The Lagos Water Corporation on Saturday commenced the repair of a water leakage on a 600mm diameter pipe between the Oyingbo and Iddo motorway in Ebute-Meta. This was contained in a statement released by the Corporationâ€™s Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Engineer Mumuni Badmus. Mumuni said the repair work was imperative at this period to ease traffic movement in the area before the closure of the Third Mainland bridge scheduled for Friday July 27-Sunday 29, 2018. He added that officers of the Nigerian Police and Lagos State Transport Management Authority (LASTMA), among others, would be available during the period of the exercise to give way to motorists plying the road as the exercise was expected to be completed before tomorrow. The GMD, however, said some parts of Lagos Island, Victoria Island, Ikoyi, Surulere and Yaba Ebute may experience disruption in water supply during this period in order to fast-track the repair work for effective service delivery.
