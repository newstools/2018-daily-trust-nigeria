Thai navy divers have reached closer to a flooded cave in northern Thailand where 12 boys and their football coach have been trapped for more than a week. They have been helped by falling water levels inside the cave, and there are plans to pump water out. Rescuers say they hope the boys aged 11 to 16 and their coach have reached a rock mound in an underground chamber. No contact has been made with them since they went to explore the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai province. Heavy rain has led to fears that the boys and their coach might not survive. Their plight has gripped the country and led to an outpouring of support and hope. Rear Admiral Apakorn Yuukongkaew, commander of the Thai Navy Seals, said his divers had reached “chamber three” in the cave complex.
