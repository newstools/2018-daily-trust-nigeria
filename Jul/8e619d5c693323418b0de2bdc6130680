The Corps Marshal and Chief Executive of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Boboye Oyeyemi, says access to vehicles by unqualified persons has made roads in Nigeria and other parts of the world dangerous. He however stressed the commitment of the Federal Government to make Nigerian roads to be among the top 20 safest in the world by the year 2020. According to him, the government through the FRSC had deployed various strategies to curb road traffic crashes and the ultimate goal is to achieve zero death on Nigerian roads. Boboye spoke in Lagos while presenting a paper on “Road Traffic Crash Trend in Nigeria” at the 2018 Annual training workshop of the Nigerian Auto Journalists Association held in Lagos. Corps Public Education Officer, Mr. Bisi Kazeem quoted Boboye as saying that as encapsulated in the road safety vision 2020:20, the Federal Government of Nigeria is poised to make Nigerian roads much safer. Oyeyemi, who was represented by the Zonal Commander for Lagos and Ogun, John Meheux also decried the spate of road crashes on Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The Corps Marshal stressed that before the establishment of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Nigeria’s roads were rated the worst next to Ethiopia. According to him, the corps had deployed strategies which led to accelerated decline from 25,792 to 8,477 in Road Traffic Crash (RTC) trends in the country. “The Nigerian Government took steps to reverse the trend through institutional arrangements and policies like; Establishment of National Road Safety Commission (NRSC) in 1974, Establishment of Oyo State Road Safety Corps 1977, and Establishment of Federal Road Safety Commission on 18 Febuary, 1988 all geared towards eradicating the menace of road traffic crash. “The key success factors that led to observed decline in RTC Trend from 1988 to 2010 revolved around the 4e’s strategies of the Corps, namely: Enforcement, Education, Enlightenment and Engineering”.
