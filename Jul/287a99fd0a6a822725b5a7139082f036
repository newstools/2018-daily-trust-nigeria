Plateau State Government yesterday said it has set in motion machinery to fish out and bring to justice all those conniving to make the state as unsafe by “sowing the seed of discord among the people.” The statement followed the pelting of Governor Simon Bako Lalong’s convoy by hoodlums after he left an Internally Displaced Person’s camp around Anguldi, in Jos South on Saturday. The attack is coming less than three weeks after a protest by women and youths under the local chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) was allegedly hijacked and led to the destruction of government properties and private vehicles of journalists and civil servants at Little Rayfield Government House. A statement issued by the state Commissioner of Information and Communication, Yakubu Dati yesterday said government views the attack on the governor’s convoy as an affront on the authority of the state and will take appropriate measures to checkmate “merchants of division and death.” “The hoodlums, acting on the script of their sponsors, laid ambush on the highway and attacked the Governor ‘s convoy with stones,  rods and other unidentified objects, damaging vehicles in the convoy including those belonging to the press corps, security and relief agencies,” the statement stated. Dati said it was regrettable that while efforts at restoring peace were yielding results, certain unpatriotic elements were bent on returning the state to the “sad era of bloodletting by instigating religious and ethnic hatred for cheap political gains.”
