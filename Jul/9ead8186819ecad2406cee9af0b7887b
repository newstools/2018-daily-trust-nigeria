President Muhammadu Buhari has no powers to stop the investigation of anyone or institution under the country’s constitution, the Presidency has said. The Presidency stated this on the heels of Senate President Bukola Saraki’s running battle with the Police over the Offa, Kwara State robbery case. Saraki was to appear at Guzape police station yesterday over the case. His name was not mentioned in the Presidency’s statement. The Presidency in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu said it had taken note of the orchestrated campaign against Buhari each time a Very Important Person (VIP) was invited by the law enforcement agencies, in the discharge of their legitimate duties and functions. “It is odd, strange and bizarre that while ordinary citizens can be called up to answer questions or be interrogated, the VIP cannot be questioned without the annoying insinuations of partisanship, persecution or outright politicization. “This country cannot achieve development in peace when important cases are viewed through a political prism and the law is considered as being applicable to some, and not applicable to others,” he said. The Presidency said, “President Buhari does not stand in the way of law enforcement either. Under our constitution, he has no powers to stop the investigation of anyone or institution. When they are set to investigate anything and anyone, the best friend of the law is the one who lets them do their work.”
