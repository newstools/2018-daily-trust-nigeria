The Administrator and CEO of the Public Service Institute of Nigeria (PSIN), Dr Abdul-Ganiyu Obatoyinbo, has listed workers commitment, dedication and implementation of extant rules as part of measures to enhance the mandate of public service in the country. He said this yesterday on arrival at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA) Abuja, after a week-long bench marking and study tour group by the Head of Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF), Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita, Heads of Service in the states and Federal and state permanent secretaries to Malaysia and Singapore. Obatoyinbo said there was no other way to make the nation’s public service effective, except that Nigerians see themselves as change agents and not leaving it to the government. “We all have to support our leaders, be committed and believe in the country. We have to see ourselves as change agents. We discovered that most of our legislations are outdated and we have to review and update the public service rules. There are also some policies that need to be reviewed to meet the modern contemporary needs and challenges.”
