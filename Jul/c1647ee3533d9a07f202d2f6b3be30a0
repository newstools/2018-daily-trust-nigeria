The Executive Secretary of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (Tetfund) Dr Baffa Bichi said a total of 22, 000 scholars have benefited from the Fund’s  scholarship intervention under the academic staff development programme in the last 10 years. Baffa stated this yesterday while addressing journalists in Abuja, saying the 22,000 scholars were sponsored to pursue masters and PhDs both at home and abroad. “In 2years we have done over 50 per cent more than has been done in the past 8years, this is because of our insistence on doing things in the right way,” he said. Bichi said not less than 9000 of the scholar benefited between 2016 and 2018, saying, academic staff development has never been successful like in the last two years.
