After a five-year trial, a member of a neo-Nazi gang has been found guilty of 10 racially-motivated murders. Beate Zschäpe was the main defendant on trial over the murder of eight ethnic Turks, a Greek citizen and a policewoman between 2000 and 2007. The Munich state court’s verdict carries an automatic life sentence. The connection between the murders was only discovered by chance in 2011, after a botched robbery led to the neo-Nazi group’s discovery.
