The operation to free 12 boys and their coach from a cave in northern Thailand is running “smoothly”, the head of the operation says. Four boys have been brought above ground, rescuers say. The mission has now been paused for at least 10 hours as their oxygen tanks need to be replaced. Rescuers decided to go ahead with the hazardous operation on Sunday because of fears of rising waters. The next phase would begin on Monday morning, after relaying “all of the air tanks and all systems along the way”, Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said. Divers have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system, where they have reportedly been able to walk the last part on foot.
