The Trump administration has said 27 young migrant children are “not eligible for reunification” with their parents, according to a court filing. Twelve other children’s mothers or fathers have already been deported from the US, said the government. “Legitimate logistical impediments” are delaying reunions for many of the 102 children under five years old who were taken from parents, US officials say. Nearly 3,000 children were split from undocumented adults entering the US. His administration was bound by a court order to reunite children aged five and under by 10 July. The Department of Justice (DoJ) and American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) joint status report on Tuesday detailed why the 27 children cannot yet be reunited with their families. The parents of 10 children were being still held in criminal custody after crossing the US border without papers, and have yet to be fully assessed, said the report.
