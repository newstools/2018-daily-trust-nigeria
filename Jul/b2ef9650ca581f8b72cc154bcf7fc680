A former head of state, General Yakubu Gowon (rtd), has said that President Muhammadu Buhari cannot condone killings as being alleged on the social media. Gowon spoke in Jos yesterday when he paid a condolence visit to Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong over the recent killings in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area. The former head of state said no leader will encourage killings of his/her people, even as he decried the past practice where suspects arrested for killings were taken to Abuja and eventually released. Gowon, who is also the National Chairman of Nigeria Prays, said people arrested should be investigated and prosecuted in Jos where the crime was committed. In his remarks, governor Lalong said the relevant laws to try perpetrators of the recent attacks on the Plateau will soon be signed into law, assuring that they have reviewed adequate laws to prosecute offenders in Jos. He commended the former Head of State for standing by the state as a father, and promised that all efforts are being made to restore the state to its place of glory. The governor also vowed to ensure the enthronement of sustainable peace on the Plateau. General Gowon was received also by the Deputy Governor, Professor Sonni Tyodden, members of the State executive council, including the SGS, Chief Rufus Bature and the John Dafaan the Chief of Staff.
