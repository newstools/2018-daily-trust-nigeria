Uganda is reviewing its decision to impose taxes on the use of social media and on money transactions by mobile phone, following a public backlash. Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda made the announcement soon after police broke up a protest against the taxes. President Yoweri Museveni had pushed for the taxes to boost government revenue and to end “gossip” on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. The social media tax targets the use of what are described as Over The Top (OTT) services, which offer “voice and messaging over the internet”, he said.
