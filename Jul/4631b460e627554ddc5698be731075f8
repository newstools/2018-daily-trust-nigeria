Another Thai boy trapped in a cave in northern Thailand has been extracted, after a third consecutive day of rescue operations. He brings to 11 the total number of boys rescued so far from a flooded cave system where 12 boys had been trapped for more than two weeks. Divers entered the cave in Thailand  where the last four boys and their football coach remained trapped this  morning, hoping to complete a final mission to bring out all five  today. Acting Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osatanakorn,  who is leading the operation, said the international rescue team  entered the cave at 10.08am this morning (4.08am BST). Ambulances were  then seen leaving the cave at around 4.30pm local time.
