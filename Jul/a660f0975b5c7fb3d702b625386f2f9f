The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano state, Senator Mas’ud El-Jibrial Doguwa has said the party is expecting Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso to join it soon.

Speaking to Daily Trust yesterday, Doguwa said consultations were still on to convince the former governor to dump the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) and return to his former party ahead of the
conduct of 2019 general elections.

Doguwa explained that although the consultations were at the national level, but the Kano state wing of the party had made all the necessary arrangements to receive Senator Kwankwaso.
