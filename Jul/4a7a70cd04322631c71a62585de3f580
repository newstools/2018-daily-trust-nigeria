Governors from the North-western part of Nigeria have assured that they will stop the killings and destruction in the zone. Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, who spoke at the meeting of the North-West governors in Kaduna, said efforts are also on to integrate the zone into one viable economic entity. He said after a marathon meeting, the governors resolved to look at three key areas, economic development, agriculture, and education. “We have taken into account that these three areas are very key to the integration of the zone and each of the North-West governor is very passionate about it”, he said. He said the governors believe that if the issue of education is tackled squarely, the spate of killings in the zone and other zones would stop. He said part of the measures being taken is to strengthen borders in order to checkmate the influx of criminals. “We are looking at it to see how we will engage thousands of our youths that are roaming the streets without jobs,” he stated.
