Stakeholders at the House of Representatives public hearing on “a bill to domesticate the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)” have asked the Federal Government to adopt the treaty under Nigerian law so as to tackle impunity arising from senseless killings in the country. The Rome Statute is the diplomatic treaty that established the ICC. Ratified in 2002, the treaty empowers the ICC to investigate and prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and aggressions in a situation, where states are ‘unable’ or ‘unwilling’ to do so. A professor of international law, Agbo Madaki, said the domestication of the Rome Statute could not have come at a better time given the mindless killings in the country and federal government’s reluctance to prosecute perpetrators of “these heinous crimes against humanity.” A representative of the Cleen Foundation, a civil society group, Dr Benson Olugbo, said Nigeria’s capacity to cooperate with the ICC against crimes and impunity was being undermined by lack of a legal framework to actualize criminal justice at the domestic level; hence, “the domestication of the Rome Statute is long overdue.” Chairman, House Committee on Treaties, Protocols and Agreements, Yakub Balogun (APC, Lagos) said the public hearing was in line with Section 12(1) of the 1999 Constitution, which empowers the National Assembly to validate treaty instruments through national legislation to fill noticeable gaps.
