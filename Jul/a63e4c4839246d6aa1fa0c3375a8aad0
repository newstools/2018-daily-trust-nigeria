The Presidency said it will soon publish the list of 200 individuals who corruptly acquired properties across the country. The Special Assistant to the President on Prosecution, Okoi Obono Obla disclosed this yesterday at the inauguration of a new software application for tracking illicit properties in the country developed by a civil society organization, African Network for Environment and Economic Justice (ANEEJ) in Abuja. Obla, who is also the chairman of the Special Investigation Panel on the Recovery of Public Property, said the list of properties located in highbrow areas such as Maitama in Abuja, are linked to serving and past public office holders. “Let them tell us where they got the money to build these massive properties. If they cannot explain, let them quietly return it to Nigerians,” he said. Inaugurating the properties tracker platform, he said the fight against corruption is for all Nigerians because “we are all victims of corruption.” The Executive Director of ANEEJ, David Ugolor said the ‘propati tracka’ is an online platform for mapping and sharing information on the owners of property in specific districts of Abuja.
