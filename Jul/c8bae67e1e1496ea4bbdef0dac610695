A professor of Paediatrics and the Chief Medical Director of Bingham University Teaching Hospital (BUTH) Jos, Edwin Essiegbe, has tasked medical personnel on service delivery to internally displaced persons in Plateau State. He spoke at the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in Heipang Community of Barkin Ladi Local Government area of Plateau State when (BUTH) went there for free medical outreach over the weekend. He said many Plateau communities and IDPs had high hopes on medical experts and it was incumbent on them to live up to expectation. He also asked governments at all levels to live up to their responsibility of protecting the lives and property of Nigerians. “Hopefully, we will not disappoint the institution we represent as medical personnel because many people in medical need are looking up to us for support,” he said.
