The Kaduna State Government has commenced the building of a park on the plot belonging to Senator Suleiman Othman Hunkuyi, which was demolished by the state’s Geographical Information Service (KADGIS) in February. The property at No.11 b Sambo Road, Kaduna was being used as secretariat of a faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna. KADGIS had in a statement by its Director General Ibrahim Husseini then said it demolished the property for alleged violations of land use and non-payment of ground rent. The  ownership of the property was revoked and allocated to another agency, KASUPDA, for the purpose of developing and maintaining a public park that would provide recreation in that residential neighbourhood. Our correspondent who was at the site noticed serious work going on with no less than 12 labourers laying block while the premises had been fenced. An official of KASUPDA confirmed that the agency had started building on the property. “You recall than when the property was demolished, the ownership was revoked and the plot was handed over to us so we are now building a children’s park there,” he stated. Hunkuyi, when contacted on the matter, described it as an act of impunity on the part of the state government “This is a threat to democracy and the rule of law and should be condemned because if it is Hunkuyi today it can be any other person tomorrow.”
