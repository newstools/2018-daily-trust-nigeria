The Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO) had rejected “The Nigerian Press Council Bill 2018” which has passed second reading at the Senate. The NPO, which comprises the Newspaper Proprietors’ Association of Nigeria (NPAN), the Nigeria Guild of Editors and the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) as well as other media stakeholders, made their position known in a joint statement. The body described the proposed bill as unconstitutional as it runs against the principles and tenets of the rule of law and is actually subjudice given that a case on the subject matter is still pending in the Supreme Court. “The bill is, for all intents and purposes, draconian and anti-press freedom being an amalgamation of the obnoxious Public Officers Protection Against False accusation Decree No. 4 of 1984 and the Newspapers Registration Decree 43 of 1993, both vestiges of the dark days of military rule and therefore incurably and irreparably bad, being also inconsistent with values of our democratic society,” the statement read. It said the bill seeks to criminalize journalism practise despite the fact the laws of the country already have enough provisions and avenues for seeking legal redress. Nduka Obaigbena signed for NPAN, Funke Egbemode for NGE, Waheed Odusile for NUJ, and John Momoh for the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria. Lanre Arogundade of the International Press Centre, Akin Akingbulu of the Institute For Media and Society and Richard Akinnola of the Media Law Centre signed for stakeholders.
