The Secretary to Osun State Government, Alhaji Moshood Olalekan Adeoti who is one of the main contenders for the governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the forthcoming election has withdrawn from the primary election of the party holding today (Friday). His withdrawal was announced in a statement issued and signed by the Director of Media and Publicity of Moshood Adeoti Campaign Organization (MACO) Mr Kayode Agbaje and made available to newsmen in Osogbo, the state capital. According to him, "Alhaji Adeoti's decision to withdraw from the race is hinged on his resolve to abide by a resolution of the Osun West Senatorial District wing of the party dissociating itself from the exercise." Agbaje said Adeoti's withdrawal was necessary so as not to give credibility to the primary election which he decribed as "jaundiced process". He said the process was designed to favour an anointed aspirant. "Alhaji Adeoti is still very much in the race to contest and win the governorship election come September 22, 2018", Agbaje noted.
