Plateau State elders, under the aegis of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Advisory Council,  have appealed to the federal government to support the state government with funds and other logistic arrangements to resettle all those displaced by the recent violence. In a statement by its chairman, Captain Joseph Din (rtd) the council said such gesture would begin the healing process and further guarantee the safety, peace and security of the citizens. The statement read: “Some unpatriotic people and disgruntled elements are bent on ensuring that Plateau State does not experience peace again. This is not only unfortunate and wicked, but upturns the long tradition of peace and accommodation for which generations of our people are known for. “As the state and federal governments, including other stakeholders are making frantic efforts to ensure that the victims of the attacks and the affected communities are stabilized, these efforts are being impeded by agents of anarchy who are busy fanning embers of disunity and suspicion in the land. “Two instances will suffice, the first is the attack on the Governor Simon Lalong’s convoy at the displaced persons camp at Anguldi Jos south local government area after he had visited the camp to share in their sorrow and pain and to present them with relief materials. We believe that even if those who pelted the governor’s convoy had genuine grievances against the administration, there are legitimate means of resolving them without resorting to violence.”
