The Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed on Wednesday reacted to the alleged NYSC certificate forgery involving the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun.  The minister made this known while speaking with journalists after the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting held at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.  “The government has spoken. NYSC is part of the government and I have nothing to add to what the NYSC has said,” Mohammed said.  It will be recalled that Adeosun who attended the FEC meeting was accused in a recent media report, alleging that she had failed to participate in the mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme and supposedly obtained a fake exemption certificate.  The one-year service is a compulsory scheme for all Nigerian graduates who have not attained the age of 30, according to the NYSC Act.
