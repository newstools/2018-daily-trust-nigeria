President Muhammadu Buhari will today commission the first phase of the Abuja Light Rail Project. He will also flag-off the railway services signalling the commencement of operations of the long-awaited rail services in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The project, which was completed by the present administration, has been in the works for over 11 years. The phase, which comprises lots 1A and 3, is only an integral part of the six lots which form the FCT railway system. The event, which will take place in the Abuja Metro Station, Central Business District, is the flagship of the 12 completed railway stations under the package. The 45.245km of standard gauge rail line running between the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport and Abuja Metro Station is the first of its kind in West Africa. The commissioning would mark formal commencement of rail service and the fulfilment of a long-awaited dream for modern state-of-the-art mass transit systems for the FCT. Meanwhile, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has solicited the partnership of the Nigerian Railway Corporation to ensure a hitch free operation of the Abuja rail mass transit system. At a meeting with officials of the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC),Â  last week, FCT Minister Muhammad Musa Bello stated that the administration would require the support, supervision and guidance of the regulators for a smooth take-off. Bello, who disclosed that some staff had already been employed to start some of the operations, added that the expertise and experience of NRC would be indispensable. Responding, the General Manager of NRC, Engr. Fidet Ohiria, pledged the support of the corporation towards the successful running of the Abuja Light Rail Project. This, he said, would include, capacity building, personnel and certification. He said the law permits states to run railways and the NRC is willing to give the needed support and ensuring effective regulation of the industry.
