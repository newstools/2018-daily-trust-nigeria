The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has blamed the ruling class for the recurring farmers-pastoralists conflicts in the country. ASUU President, Professor Biodun Ogunyemi, while addressing a press conference on the state of the nation, yesterday in Abuja, accused the ruling class of manipulating the situation for economic and political goals. He said, “The chief beneficiaries are not the cattle workers, not the farmers, not the millions of Nigerians, who are fed with stories of ethnic hostility and hatred arising from a manipulated faulty interpretation of the conflicts. “The farmers-pastoralist conflict is an outcome of a combination of environmental ecological crisis, and socio-historically derived problems which the ruling class of Nigeria, in its different wings, has been manipulating to suit its economic and political goals.” He said the Federal Government must take responsibility for failure to anticipate, manage and control the crisis, saying government’s handling of the issue fell far short of protecting certain constitutional provisions on fundamental human rights.
