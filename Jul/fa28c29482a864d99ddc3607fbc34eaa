The 2018 graduating students of Senior Secondary (3) class of Ladela Schools at the weekend in Abuja pledged to sponsor the West African Examination Council’s school certificate examination and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board’s unified tertiary matriculation examination for 10 HIV/AIDS vulnerable students. The students, who made the pledge during the schools’ graduation and prize giving ceremony, assured that they would liaise with the Catholic Action Committee of HIV/AIDS Abuja to ensure that the beneficiaries were properly chosen. The school’s administrator, Chinwe Ugboru, said it was the tradition of the schools’ graduating students to always give back to the society in form of social responsibility projects. Speaking at the event, the Chief Executive Officer of Youngsters Foundation, Kingsley N.T. Bangwell, advised students to adopt a personal code to live by. He said students should write down moral principles they want to adopt and strive to stand by them even in the midst of temptations. He gave the example of late Prof. Dora Akunyili, who returned a huge sum of money that was the balance for her medical treatment abroad and was rewarded years later with the job of the director-general of NAFDAC by President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration. Highlights of the event were the launching of Ladela Digest by Engr. Femi Ebofin, Justice Danlami Senchi, Dr. Joshua Usman and other parents, while prizes were given to students who excelled in their academics with Fadila Usman Mohammed winning the overall best graduating student prize.
