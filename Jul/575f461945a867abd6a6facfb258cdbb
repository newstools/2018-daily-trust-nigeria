A justice reform organization, Citizens United for the Rehabilitation of Errant (CURE) has accused the Federal Government of paying lip service to prison congestion in Nigeria. The Executive Director of CURE-Nigeria, Sylvester Uhaa in a statement to mark Mandela Day yesterday, said prison congestion had not received the desired attention by government. Uhaa said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s initial statement that prisons in Nigeria turned inmates to ‘animals’ failed to yield concrete action as the situation persists after a handful of releases across the country. Uhaa said 70 per cent of inmates in prisons are awaiting trial and are subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment with poor access to lawyers.
