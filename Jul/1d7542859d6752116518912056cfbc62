Twenty-two Nigerian diplomats are currently undergoing a Special Training Programme at the Foreign Service Institute in India. The two-week training programme which runs from July 30 to August 10, 2018 is fully funded by the Government of India, said a statement from the Indian High Commission in Abuja. It was part of the ongoing cooperation between the Ministry of External Affairs of India and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria to improve capacity building under the South-South Cooperation. “This is also part of India’s commitment to its friendly countries in sharing the knowledge and expertise acquired in the field of diplomats’ training through specialized training programmes under the decisions taken at the third India-Africa Forum Summit (IAFS-III) held in New Delhi in October 2015,” the statement said. The training was to enrich Nigerian diplomats’ appreciation and understanding of critical international and regional issues the world is confronting. It also aims to acquaint participants with “political, economic, social and cultural realities those sway the foreign relations, to acquaint them about India’s history and culture, to make participants aware of India’s view on contemporary issues and to hone diplomatic skills.”
