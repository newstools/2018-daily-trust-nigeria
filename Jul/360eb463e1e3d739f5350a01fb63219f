The Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Makurdi has commenced spinal cord surgery, the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the hospital, Dr Peteru Inunduh, has said. Speaking in Makurdi yesterday, the CMD said already five surgeries have been successfully carried out. Inunduh said the facility was the first hospital in the state to conduct spinal surgery with the expertise of an Egypt-trained consultant specialist in Spine and Orthopaedics. He said apart from the surgeon who performed the five surgeries since his return in 2017, there were 20 other medical doctors undergoing specialist trainings across the world. “We realized that the surgical equipment for spinal surgeries are expensive and in the 2018 budget we have a sub head for the purchase of medical equipment and we intend to try as much as possible to procure between 70 to 75 per cent of the equipment they need for such major surgeries,” Inunduh said. On his part, the Spine and Orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Joseph Okoh, applauded the federal government for supporting his work through the FMC Makurdi management. Okoh said the first spinal surgery was conducted during the last industrial action by health workers.
