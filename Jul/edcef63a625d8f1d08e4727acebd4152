An Agege customary court is set to deliver ruling on the possible dissolution of the 23-year-old marriage between Mrs Halimat Yaya and her husband, Ahmed Yaya, over alleged domestic violence. Halimat, a businesswoman and indigene of Kogi State whose marriage to Yaya was contracted in 1995, claimed that there was no more love in the marriage. “I have never enjoyed my marriage and have had no rest of mind. There has been no peace as my husband is temperamental and finds fault in everything I do. My husband beats me whenever he feels like. He is an aggressive person and life with him has become unbearable. He does not take care of me even when I fall sick. l am tired of the marriage. I want the court to separate us as I have moved out of his house since June 2017,” she said. The respondent, Yaya, 48, however, denied Halimat’s accusations against him but said he was ready for dissolution. He said he loved his wife and had always cared for her, adding that each time they moved to a new house, he rented a shop for her close to the house with his money. “My wife’s current shop is the third one I rented for her since we got married. I practically made my wife what she is today. Maybe she has met someone she thinks is better and wealthier than I am and that is why she wants the marriage dissolved,” he said. On the alleged beating, he said, “We stay in a face-to-face house, so neighbours can testify I don’t beat her. My wife no longer finds me worthy of being her husband and I take no offence to that,” he said. The court president, Mrs Ibironke Elabor, urged the estranged couple to be law-abiding and peaceful and adjourned the case until July 31, 2018 for judgment.
