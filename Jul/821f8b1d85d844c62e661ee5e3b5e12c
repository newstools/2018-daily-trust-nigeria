The Speaker of Kano State House of Assembly, Alhaji Yusuf Abdullahi Ata, has said the recent defection of Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the All Progressives Congress (APC) was long overdue. Speaking to Daily Trust, Ata also said Kwankwaso’s defection would not in any way affect the ruling APC and the victory of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in the 2019 general elections. Ata explained that victory in everything, including elections was in the hands of God who gave power to whoever He wants and at the appointed time. “The defection of Senator Kwankwaso from APC to PDP is long overdue. For a very long time, we have not been together. His stay in APC was just symbolic. So if today he announces his defection to PDP, it will not surprise many of us because we knew he has not been with APC for a very long time,” he said. On the rumour that some state legislators had decamped to PDP, the speaker said, “to the best of my knowledge, no single member of Kano State House of Assembly decamped to PDP. I have never heard this and I don’t think our members can do that.” Also speaking to Daily Trust, a member of the Kano Assembly representing Municipal Local Government Area, Alhaji Baffa Babba Danagundi, dispelled the rumour of defection of some APC members to PDP. “Even the six members of Kwankwasiyya group in the house have not announced their defection to PDP not to talk of APC members that are loyal to Ganduje. We are loyal to Ganduje and we will remain loyal to him,” he said.
