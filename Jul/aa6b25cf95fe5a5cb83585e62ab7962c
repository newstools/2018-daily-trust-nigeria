The European Union and Japan have signed one of the world’s biggest free trade deals, covering nearly a third of the world’s GDP and 600 million people. One of the biggest EU exports to Japan is dairy goods, while cars are one of Japan’s biggest exports. The move contrasts sharply with actions by the US Trump administration, which has introduced steep import tariffs. EU Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal underlined the “win-win” solutions offered by free trade. Mr Juncker said: “[The] impact of today’s agreement goes far beyond our shores. Together we are a making, by signing this agreement, a statement about the future of free and fair trade. “We are showing that we are stronger and better off when we work together. And we are leading by example, showing that trade is about more than tariffs and barriers. It is about values, principles and finding win-win solutions for all those concerned.”
