Some senators yesterday expressed anger over what they termed delays by the House of Representatives in concurring with bills forwarded by the Senate. The senators said while they always expedite action on bills sent from the House for concurrence, the same could not be said of the Green Chamber. Based on legislative procedure, a bill passed by either chamber would have to be concurred before it is transmitted to the president for assent. Contributing to the debate on 12 bills that came from the House for concurrence at yesterday plenary, Senator James Manager (PDP, Delta) said there should be reciprocity on the part of the House. “Whatever we do here, the House should be able to reciprocate. But you’ll see that our bills sent to the House suffer unnecessary delays. It shouldn’t be so. In-as-much-as I’ll support the second reading of the bills; I think the leadership should take it up with the leadership of the House. Adamu Aliero (APC, Kebbi) said, “I don’t think it’s a normal procedure for us to just pass bills coming from the House. Let the bills go through all the stages. We should debate the bills, refer them to the committees before passing them.” But Deputy Senate Leader, Bala Ibn Na’allah, who had moved for the second reading of the bills, said the Senate could consider the bills without subjecting them to Aliero’s suggestion. The 12 bills were referred to the Committee of the Whole were they were concurred with by the Senate. After the passage, Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, who president the session said, “We’ll continue to work with the House of Reps to pass bills. I hope the House of Reps will reciprocate this gesture and pass bills that we send to them for concurrence.”
