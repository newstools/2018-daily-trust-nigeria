The increasing rate of abject poverty in Nigeria is an act of social injustice to Nigerians and needs to be tackled in more vibrant ways, Country Director Christian Aid, Charles Usie said. He said this at the lesson sharing event of the Voice to the People (V2P), a project aimed at supporting hard-to-reach communities in Nigeria to tackle poverty by taking ownership of their development at the Local Government Level. Usie decried that Nigeria is not on the path of global trends in poverty eradication while countries like China and India are having a drastic decrease in poverty rate. “Nigeria seems to be retrogressing in terms of the global push for eradication of extreme poverty which is what the sustainable development goals have said it would eradicate. We seem not to be making any progress because the latest research shows Nigerians plunging into abject poverty everyday.” He said. He called on the Federal Government to strengthen the capacity of citizens to influence policies and government commitment in programmes that improves the Local Government level. While commending the V2P projects, Commissioner of Women Affairs and Social Development Kaduna state, Hafsat Muhammed Baba advised that empowering women and children at the community level will help to curb the increasing rate of extreme poverty in the country. “Looking at our culture, it’s not easy for women in the north to speak out for their communities but V2P advocacy call is gradually breaking through. Women have formed cooperatives that foster peace, growth, and unity.” She said, her ministry liaising with V2P to empower women through the special intervention loan made accessible by the Kaduna state government is improving the quality of lives at the community level.
