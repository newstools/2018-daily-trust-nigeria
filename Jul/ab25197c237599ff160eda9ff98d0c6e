Thirty-three people have died in a heat wave that has baked the southern part of the Canadian province of Quebec, officials say. The sweltering weather began last Friday with temperatures hitting 35C (95F) and high humidity. The death toll has climbed every day this week, with 17 total deaths reported by Wednesday and 33 recorded by Thursday. The heat wave is the worst the province has seen in decades.  Officials are urging people to drink plenty of water and stay in the shade. “We’re doing everything we can,” said Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante. The city has opened pools and air conditioned spaces to the public. Mayor Plante said first responders have been going door-to-door, checking on some 15,000 vulnerable residents.
