The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi, has advised government at all levels to co-opt traditional rulers in effective tax collection. He said such move would bring more revenue to governmentâ€™s purse as monarchs are the closest to the grassroots. Oba Akanbi said tax is a primary source of revenue for every government, praying that government should engage trusted and respected monarchs as intermediates between government and tax payers. The monarch said only Lagos State was matured for voluntary tax payment, while calling for the cooperation of traditional rulers to assist government in increasing Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). In a statement by the palace press secretary, Mr Alli Ibraheem and made available to journalists, the Oba condemned the neglect of monarchs and their roles by the government.
