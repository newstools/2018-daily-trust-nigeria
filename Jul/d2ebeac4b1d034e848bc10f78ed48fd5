Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Adams Oshiomhole has threatened to recommend sack of the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige. Oshiomhole’s threat was over the delay in the inauguration of the board of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). Oshiomhole while speaking to State House Correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja said the Minister would first be suspended from the party and afterwards, he would be recommended for sack from the federal cabinet. He said if the minister refuses to inaugurate the board, he would be suspended, saying they must return internal discipline to the party. “For me it is the height of mischief for any minister, you cannot purport to be honourable minister and you act dishonourably and nobody is greater than the party. If the President condones disrespect for his office, I will not condone disrespect for the party. And when we expel the minister we will prevail on the president that he can’t keep in his cabinet people who have neither respect for his own decisions nor have respect for the party without which they would not have been ministers. “There are no independent candidate in our system, nobody, I emphasis no minister is above the party and they have taken undue advantage of the president’s fatherly disposition,” he said.
