The two major splinter groups within the Kaduna State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have pulled out of the party. The Restoration Group led by Alhaji Tijani Ramalan has members like Senator Suleiman Othman Hunkuyi, while the APC Akida which is led by Mataimaki Tom Maiyashi has people like Senator Shehu Sani and Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed among others. Baba-Ahmed resigned from the APC about two weeks ago. The groups, which opposed the leadership style of Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai at a joint press conference in Kaduna, said they were leaving the APC because it was incapable of accommodating and responding to well-meaning dissent, criticism and demands inclusiveness and internal democracy. Maiyashi spoke on behalf of APC Akida Group while Barrister Jaafaru Abbas Ibrahim represented the Restoration Group. The groups said the APC had not lived up to the expectations of people who laboured to put it in power and that of Nigerians who expected that it would usher in genuine change.
