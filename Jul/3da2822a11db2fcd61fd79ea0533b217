Five-year-old Hafsat Abdulyasar was born normal but at eight months old, she became ill. In his referral letter, dated July 22, 2015, an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon, Professor Babagana B.M. Ahmad of Halima E.N.T. Hospital and General Practice, Trade Fair Layout, Kaduna, Nigeria, said “This patient presented to our clinic with hearing loss since infancy. This followed a febrile illness with loss of consciousness and convulsions. She had delayed milestones. She was seen at National Ear Center Kaduna where she was advised for surgery. Finding on examinations were that of dull lymphatic membranes bilaterally with normal external ears. So there were no remarkable findings in the nose and throat. Her audiogram showed no response at 80dB for frequencies 0.5-4 KHz. Tympanogram revealed type B in the right and type As on the left ears. We will appreciate any assistance rendered to this patient.” Hafsat Abduyasar has been referred to Columbia Asia Hospitals in India for cochlear implant at the cost of $23,650 equivalent to N8,608,600 (Eight million, six hundred and eight thousand, six hundred naira). However, she was denied admission into a nursery school because she could not speak. She is at home as she cannot even pronounce her own name and her only means of communication is by touching a person and vice versa. Hafsat is therefore soliciting for financial assistance from the general public to enable her travel to India for the operation and for her to live a normal life.
