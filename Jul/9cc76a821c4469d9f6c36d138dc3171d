President Muhammad Buhari said all recovered illegally acquired assets would be sold in the administration’s renewed anti-graft campaign. The President, who was responding to a question during an interactive session with the Nigerian community in Togo at the Nigerian Embassy on Sunday night, said when the recovered assets are sold the money would be paid into the country’s treasury. Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Malam Garba Shehu who disclosed this, said the President, assured that his administration had remained steadfast in keeping to its three campaign promises of providing security, improving the economy and fighting corruption. The President noted that if past governments had utilised 25 per cent of the huge oil revenue available to them, Nigerians would not be complaining today. He cited the $16 billion reportedly spent on electricity and yet Nigerians could not see the power.
