Ex- Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso of Kano State would most likely dump the All Progressives Congress (APC) today. Many of his aides and supporters have taken to the social media this morning proclaiming that Kwankwaso would finally announce his defection this afternoon. They said what the senator would do this afternoon would change the political landscape of Nigeria forever. His spokesperson, Binta Spikin who took to the Facebook, was only short of saying Kwankwaso had left APC but the wordings she used clearly indicated that the cat-and-mouse game was over. According to her, “Keep a date. Today at 2pm, you will witness the most brilliant political move of our time; Well-done all.” Kwankwaso had last week told Publisher Dele Momodu that only the PDP had the capacity to defeat President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC, saying he was optimistic of defeating the president once he got the ticket of the PDP. Muazu Magaji who served as Kwankwaso’s Senior Special Assistant on Projects while Kwankwaso was Kano State governor, hit the nail on the head in his Facebook wall. He simply said, “Rabiu Kwankwaso dumps APC.” According to him, “There is massive jubilation across Kano and the rest of Nigeria as the former governor of Kano state, Rabiu Kwankwaso dumps APC, reveals to PDP, other parties how to dislodge Buhari from the Villa in 2019."
