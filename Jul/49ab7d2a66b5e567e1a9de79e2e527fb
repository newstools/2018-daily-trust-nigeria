The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied a media report that the leadership of the commission diverted N702m monthly salary of new operatives. Spokesman Wilson Uwujaren in a statement yesterday explained that the publication, among others, alleged that the commission failed to pay the entitlements of cadet officers who recently completed their training at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). Uwujaren said it was also alleged that the Acting Chairman of EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, refused to pay the officers of DSC7 their entitlements which include salary arrears of 13 months under training, which was budgeted for in 2016 and 2017 budget as their date of appointment reads 18th March 2017 and their 28 days allowance for being posted to polar regions. It also alleged that staff contributions to the commission’s Cooperative Society was diverted to the construction of the head office building of the commission, making it impossible for staff members to access  their contributions. Uwujaren, however said, “For the avoidance of doubt, the EFCC wishes to state that there is no N702milllion that was diverted from the salaries of any group of employees.” He noted that the idea of diversion of salaries may well be part of a plot to incite impressionable young officers.
