Police in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have arrested, dismissed and arraigned the policeman who allegedly killed a female corps member in Abuja on Wednesday night, the FCT police commissioner, Sadiq Bello, said yesterday. Angela Linda Igwetu, who was due to pass out the next day after serving in Abuja under the compulsory one-year National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) programme, was allegedly shot Wednesday night around Ceddi Plaza by the policeman and was confirmed dead at the Garki Hospital. The policeman who allegedly shot Angela was identified as Benjamin Peters, according to a petition written to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) by a law firm representing a sister of the deceased. FCT Commissioner of police, Sadiq Bello, told newsmen yesterday that all necessary disciplinary procedures had been concluded. “He (the suspect) has been dismissed from the force and arraigned before a court of competent jurisdiction and he is currently on remand awaiting trail,” he said. Bello added; “It was alleged that the lady, one Angela Igwetu, stood up and brought out her head through the roof of a Toyota Camry car shouting and was calling for help that she was kidnapped.” He said policemen at the stop-and-search point at Ceddi Plaza claimed that they flagged down the vehicle but the driver refused to stop, which made the police Inspector to open fire on the vehicle, hitting Angela. Bello said the command would not condone acts of irresponsibility and incivility or outright criminality from officers and men of the police. He appealed for calm and understanding from the public, and the family of the deceased, as justice will prevail.
