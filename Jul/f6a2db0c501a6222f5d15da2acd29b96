An early morning fire outbreak on Tuesday razed a section of Ecobank on Kofo Abayomi way in Victoria Island, Lagos. Witnesses said that both staffs and those who were at bank to carry out early morning banking transactions scampered to safety for fear of being trapped in the ragging inferno. Emeka Chukwuebube, who claimed to have gone to do transfer said that there was an explosion followed by yellow balls of fire. "I quickly removed my ATM card from the machine before I ran out of the premises. I met many staff of the bank when I eventually got outside," he said.
