A fresh batch of 160 returnees from Libya has arrived the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Lagos in the late hours of Thursday.   They arrived aboard a Libyan Airline plane with registration number 5A-DMG which landed at the cargo terminal of the airport with officials of the Federal Government on ground to receive the returnees.   The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) which received the returnees alongside other agencies of government disclosed that the returnees comprised seven female adults and 153 male adults.  Director-General of NEMA, Mustapha Maihajja represented by Mr. Segun Afolayan admonished the returnees to see their experiences as part of their lives and strive to forge ahead to achieve positive things in life.  "You have another opportunity to make a new start of posterity and abundance, nobody can tell it better than you all. â€œThere are no easier greener pastures anywhere and live a dignified life, make your family happier and make the country proud, more innovations at self reliance and creativity are the best option", the DG was quoted as saying.   According to the NEMA boss, the Federal, States and the development partners are working assiduously to create more conducive atmosphere "where we all can prosper".   One of the returnees, Kingsley Edward, a graduate of Accountancy from Delta State Polytechnic, called on the Federal Government to create more opportunities for the youth to be engaged and have equal opportunity with other privileged Nigerians.   He stated that he decided to leave the country because of the endemic corruption.  "A situation where if you don't have someone at the end to help, job will not be possible is one of the reasons I left the country", he said, adding however that he regretted the adventure after blowing almost a million naira in an attempt to go to Germany.
