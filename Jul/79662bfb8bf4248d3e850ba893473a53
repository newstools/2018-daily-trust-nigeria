The Vice Chancellor, University of Nigeria, Nsukka  Prof Benjamin Ozumba has disclosed that the university  will commence the supply of ginger to McCormic Company, a major producer of spices, flavouring and herbs in the United States of America by December. 

The Vice Chancellor made this known while inspecting more than five hectares of ginger farm planted in April at the Nsukka campus of the university. 

Prof. Ozumba said: “We have signed Memorandum of Understanding with McCormic Company to off-take any quantity of ginger we produce,” adding that the farm was a pilot study for a large scale ginger production by the university. 

He said the initiative was facilitated by alumni of the university based in the United States of America with the intention of providing good teaching point for students and revenue to the institution.
