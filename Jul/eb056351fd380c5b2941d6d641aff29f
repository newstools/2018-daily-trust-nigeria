The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is seeking greater collaboration with ECOWAS on the renewed efforts to curb drugs and substance abuse as well as trans-national crimes in the region. The UNODC Regional Representative Mr. Pierre Lalaque made this known in Abuja during a courtesy call on the Vice President of the ECOWAS Commission Mrs Finda Koroma. He said in working with ECOWAS and members of the Sahel Group of Five nations (G5), a lot of interventions are needed in the areas of drug use, piracy, human and armed trafficking as well as irregular migration. Disclosing that the UNODC is also working with ECOWAS to create a reliable data base on drugs in the region, Mr. Lalaque noted the need to leverage on the joint projects stemming from the Praia Declaration as it concerns the supply of and demand for drugs. The UNDP chief stressed that the prevailing situation necessitated the holding of its steering Committee meeting twice a year while the implementation of the decisions is subject to the “capacity of the national entities.” Responding, Vice President Koroma stressed ECOWAS’s commitment to preventing and reintegrating reformed victims back into the society. She identified the issues of drug abuse prevention, criminal justice system, as well as legal reforms as critical things to look at in an enduring partnership with UNODC. Mrs. Koroma harped on the need to tackle existing stereotypes while reversing the trend whereby girls in the region are now getting more addicted to drugs. Urging the UNODC team to “Keep up the good work”, she noted that the documents already signed between ECOWAS Commission and the UNODC will come handy in the desire to pay attention to results and ensuring that the desired impact is made.
