The University of Abuja Teaching Hospital chapter of the National Association of Residents Doctors (NARD) has urged the Federal Government to step up efforts in addressing the lingering security challenges facing the country. The president of the association, Dr. Akor Godday, made the call during a valedictory session in honour of one of its member, late Dr Oluremi Alabi, who was killed by suspected gunmen along Abuja-Kaduna road, recently. He said security was paramount in the social, economic and political development of the nation hence there was need for government to give it greater attention. He described late Alabi as a hardworking doctor in the surgical department, with impeccable character and who made positive impact within and outside the hospital. Dr. Akor decried the spate of killings in the country and advised NigeriansÂ  to be more vigilant and security conscious. Also speaking, the Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Prof. Bisallah Ekele, described the late Alabi as a staff who dedicated to the profession and service to humanity. He said Alabi lived a life of service to others, his patients, family and to anyone who had the honour and pleasure of knowing him.
