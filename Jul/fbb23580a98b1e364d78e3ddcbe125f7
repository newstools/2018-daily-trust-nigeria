Policemen on Tuesday morning blocked the convoy of the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki at Lake Chad Junction, Maitama, Abuja. Effort to get the reaction of the Police over this latest move proves abortive as at the time of filing this report. The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) on Monday sent an invitation letter to Saraki asking him to appear before investigators in Abuja tomorrow, July 24.
