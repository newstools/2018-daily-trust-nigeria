The chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has set up a committee to resolve grey areas in the council’s bye-law and ensure it is in tandem with the constitution. Candido, while inaugurating the seven-man committee urged its members to identify grey areas and contentious clauses in the bye-law that create conflict with other agencies and also review contractual agreements made with private organisations. “The council has not the best contractual agreements from 2010. Look at anything contract from 2010 till date because there are cases from 2010 which have refused to die because of contractual agreement,” he said. He said the committee should visit all government agencies, including the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), Satellite Town Development Department (STDD), FCT Internal Revenue Service (FCT IRS), in harmonising relevant laws and ensure that the council was not short-changed. The chairman of the committee and speaker, AMAC legislative council, Daniel Michael, expressed delight on the committee and assured that they will not betray the trust placed on them.
