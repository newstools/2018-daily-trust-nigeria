A non-governmental organization, Human Development Initiatives has called on civil society organizations to fully participate in tracking the implementation of the FCT Universal Basic Education Board Action Plan to ensure accountability and transparency. The Research and Programme officer of HDI Cluster, Olayemi Samuel, made the call in Abuja during the sensitization programme on Year 2016 FCT UBEB Action Plan. He said the training became essential to provide the participants with in-depth knowledge of the FCT UBEB Action Plan and matching grants to states. He decried the non-inclusion of CSOs in the entire process of the action plan which, he noted, has made it difficult for them to access the content of the plan. He said lack of political will has become one of the major challenges of basic education across the various states, adding that most states did not draw down the matching grants for basic education. Samuel urged state governments to pay more attention to basic education as the bedrock of the future.
