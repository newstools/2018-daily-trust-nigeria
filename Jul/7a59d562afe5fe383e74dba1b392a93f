The Lagos State government is set to train police personnel attached to the state Task Force on a programme dubbed ‘Active Combating and Readiness’. The programme, which will be in four batches, will commence today, Monday, at the Police Training School, Ikeja, Lagos. The Chairman of the Lagos State Task Force, Chief Superintendent of Police Olayinka Egbeyemi, explained that as crime became more complex, the officers charged with enforcing our laws must be exposed to new and constantly evolving policing philosophies. Egbeyemi said the training programme would help officers to override natural inclinations, biases or reservations they encounter while performing their duties. According to the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, officers should have problem-solving skills, while being polite and professional at the same time. The training programme will be for one month and be coordinated by Lateral Techniques Company and senior instructors from the Counter Terrorist Unit and Police Mobile Force.
