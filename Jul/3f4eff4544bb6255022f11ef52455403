A former police spokesman for the Ondo State police command and current Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Ilara-Mokin, Ifedore Local Government, Ondo State, Mr Wole Ogodo, has said he narrowly escaped attack at the weekend by an irate mob which attacked and set ablaze a commercial bus. The bus had allegedly killed two persons on the Akure-Ilesa-Ibadan expressway. Ogodo, who described as untrue the report that he was beaten at the scene by the mob, said that some angry youths actually pushed him when he wanted to find out why they set the vehicle ablaze. According to him, the mob had set the vehicle ablaze before he got to the scene of the accident on Sunday. Daily Trust gathered that the accident occurred when the Lagos-bound 18-seater commercial bus crushed two yet-to-be-identified passengers on motorcycle to death. The development was said to have triggered a violent protest by the mob, which set the vehicle ablaze. The protesters accused the driver of reckless driving. The mob, it was further learnt, blocked the expressway, causing a serious traffic hold-up. Some security personnel who raced to the scene were said to have been attacked by the mob for allegedly trying to stop them from burning the bus. Normalcy was later restored after some hours with the efforts of security operatives. Denying he was assaulted, Ogodo said that nobody could have beaten a police officer that he was in the heavy presence of security agents that included soldiers and policemen drafted to calm the situation.
