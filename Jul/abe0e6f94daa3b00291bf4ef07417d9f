Rivers State Internal Revenue Services (RIRS) yesterday picketed the Port Harcourt/Aba road office of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The RIRS Director, Manson Endeboh, who led the team, said the agency sealed NDDC headquarters office for owing Rivers State government withholding tax. He said the commission had made some payment but stated that the payment came after it had approached a court for ex parte order to seal the office. The Special Assistant to NDDC Managing Director, Chijioke Amu-nnadi, who spoke on behalf of Nsima Ekere, expressed dismay over the disruption of activities at its headquarters by RIRS. He said the commission was surprised by the development, “because the commission had already begun paying the Revenue Service the arrears under question.” “Last week, the commission paid the first tranche. They will receive the next tranche this week. This is a sign of goodwill and commitment on the side of the commission to meet these obligations.”
