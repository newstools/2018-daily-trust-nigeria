The Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria will represent Nigeria at the Entrepreneurship Action and Us (ENACTUS) World Competition in the United State in October following the emergence of its team as the overall winner of this yearâ€™s national competition in Lagos last Thursday. A statement in Zaria yesterday by Director, Public Affairs Directorate of the institution, Dr Ismaila Shehu, said over 36 countries were expected to participate at the tournament to take place at Silicon Valley, San Jose, California. The ABU team that participated in the Lagos tournament, according to him, was led by Usman Suleiman Waziri and Paul Onaji under the supervision of ABU ENACTUS Faculty Adviser, Professor M K Aliyu. The ABU team won the Lagos tournament on account of its project on an artisanal mining community in Bagega village in Zamfara State where several children and adults lost their lives due to lead poisoning as a result of the gold mining activities around the area. The team intervened by developing a water filtration mechanism which provides clean water to the community as well as evolving a Jathropha Integrated Energy Scheme through the planting of jathropha trees for remediation of the contaminated soil.
