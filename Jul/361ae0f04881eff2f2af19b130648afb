“It is not in vogue for youth to say they are waiting for government to provide jobs for them. Create one for yourself.” These were the creative words of Halima Mustapha, the CEO of Just Kimonos and Skirts. In a recent encounter with the Daily Trust YOUTHVILLE, Halima said, “I have never in my life dreamt of being a business woman. All I have wished for is working for a big IT firm which I am still hoping for but before that comes I need to sustain myself. “Surprisingly I am doing fine with the business and everything is moving well,” she said. The Kwara state graduate of Computer Science from Federal University of Technology, Minna said her love for the fashion industry lured her in to the business. Halima started the business with just N10,000 after her National Youth Service Corps scheme. She just wanted to get busy with something before her dream job arrives and now she hopes to create a brand that sells affordable and stylish clothes for Muslim ladies. “The business is a very lucrative one. Everybody wants to look good and once they know they can trust you to give them quality they will always stick to your brand,” she said. The young entrepreneur said social media has been very instrumental in getting her business to her target audience. “My target customers are everyday women who love to look good while fully covered and they are on that platform,” said Halima. However like most start-ups, she’s limited by funding hurdles. She said, “Because I started with a little amount, I couldn’t make the clothes in large quantity, which has been slowing the business. I have to have them ready for customers to indicate interest to patronize.” For other youth waiting for government jobs, Halima advised them to start something and be focused, dedicated, and consistent in that. “Youth should start something no matter how small it is, just start! You will be surprised how well it will grow with dedication and hard work,” Halima noted.
