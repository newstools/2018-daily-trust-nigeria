There was a mild drama as a woman, who accompanied other Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) northern leaders to the Villa on Thursday, Leah Solomon, knelt down before Buhari and wept profusely over the killings by suspected herdsmen in parts of Nigeria.

She sought Buhari's audience with the Northern Christian women.

Buhari directed her to liaise with the State Chief of Protocol, Lawal Kazaure, for a meeting to be arranged with the women Christian group from the region.

Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong told State House reporters after meeting Buhari that there was no room for land grabbers to take over deserted communities in the state, adding that his administration was working towards ressetling those displaced by conflicts back to their villages.

Lalong said an amendment of the state's criminal act aimed at giving stiffer penalties to those convicted for violence was under way.
