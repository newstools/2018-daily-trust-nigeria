The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the FCT has said that over 260,000 Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) are yet to be collected , with 16,931 of the cards in Gwagwalada Area Council. Alhaji Yahaya Bello, Resident Electoral Commissioner in-charge of the FCT, made this known in Abuja yesterday during a sensitisation meeting in Gwagwalada. He said the number of uncollected PVCs was  worrisome,  adding that the commission would not extend the closing date of Aug 17 for voter registration. Bello charged the chairman of the council, Mr Adamu Mustapha, and all political party executives in the area to refocus on sensitisation as they go on the compaign. He said the electorate ought to know and understand the importance and use of the cards before the 2019 general elections. “If you don’t sensitise the people properly on the need to collect their cards, who will vote for you and how will you win? “Politicians are the beneficiaries of the PVCs and not INEC; you should be more worried and concerned over the increasing number of uncollected PVCs than us. “It is your duty as stakeholders to urge the electorate on the collection of the cards, ” he said. The commissioner said while the distribution of cards would continue until one week to the general elections, voter registration would be suspended from Aug. 17 until after the 2019 general elections. The council chairman, Mustapha, commended the commission for the visit. He  expressed optimism that the effort would get more people prepared for the general elections. He also appealed to religious heads to preach the message of peace to their followers.
