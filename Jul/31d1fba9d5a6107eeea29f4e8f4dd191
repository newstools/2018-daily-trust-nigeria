Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike of Rivers State said yesterday that what transpired during the Ekiti governorship election was “the worst political robbery in the nation’s democratic history.” According to him, “The APC Federal Government will not be able to replicate the Ekiti political robbery in Rivers State. Governor Wike spoke at the Anglican Cathedral Church of Saint Paul, Port Harcourt, during the thanksgiving service to mark the end of third year anniversary celebration of his administration. He said: “Don’t be worried about what happened in Ekiti State.  We are prepared. It will not happen here in Rivers State. “I have never experienced that kind of robbery in politics; I told my colleagues, do not give them any chance. Most of them in APC are happy that they will repeat the same thing in Rivers State; we are waiting, come and repeat (it),” he said.
