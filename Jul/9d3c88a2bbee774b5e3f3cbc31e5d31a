The House of Representatives has been thrown into a momentous, rapturous plenary session following open identification with, and chanting of r-APC slogans by some members of the green chamber. This followed the overt identification by Tope Olayemi (APC, Kwara) and Bode Ayorinde (APC, Ondo) as members of the r-APC instead of APC. Olayemi, who had stood up to contribute to a debate on a matter of urgent importance by Osy Prestige (APGA, Abia) instead launched into the chanting of r-APC! to the thunderous approval of some of his colleagues. Olayemi, Bode Ayorinde (APC, Ondo) had earlier identified himself boldly as an r-APC member to the applause of some members of the House. The mild drama that followed lasted a few minutes before the Speaker Yakubu Dogara was able to bring the situation under control for normal proceedings of the House to continue.
