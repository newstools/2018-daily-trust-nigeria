US President Donald Trump has vowed to help end “vicious and violent” conflicts in Africa. Speaking to journalists during a NATO summit in Brussels, Mr Trump said Africa was on “our very strong list” of priorities. He added, “Africa right now has got problems like few people would understand. They have got things going on there that nobody could believe in this room. “If you saw some of the things that I see through intelligence - what’s going on in Africa - it is so sad, it is so vicious and violent - and we want peace. “We want peace for Africa. We want peace all over the world.”
