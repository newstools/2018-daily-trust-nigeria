The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has challenged the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to present its scorecard of achievements in the area of infrastructural development, in Southeast and the South-South zones during its 16 years rule. The minister threw the challenge while inspecting ongoing construction of the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway last week, a statement by the ministry said. Alhaji Mohammed said it was ‘disheartening’ that some politicians had made it their pastime to criticize the current administration for allegedly neglecting the two regions without verifiable proof. He said the intervention of the present administration in the provision of infrastructure in the southeast, in particular, had exposed the PDP for deceiving the people of the region for the 16 years it was in power. “I’m particularly glad that we came on this trip for two reasons. I think it has given the lie to those naysayers, who have painted the administration as having done nothing for the southeast and the south-south,” he said. “When we were coming on this (third) stretch of the road, I was informed that until this administration came, an entire lane was completely impassable after it was turned to a refuse dump. Now the question is: In 16 years, what did the PDP do on the Enugu-Port Harcourt Road?” the minister said.
