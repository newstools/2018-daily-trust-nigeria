Four suspects arraigned before an Ikeja magistrate’s court for allegedly stealing diesel have been granted a N8.6 million bail each. The accused - Sagir Mohammed, 45; Folashade Opasanya, 42; Ayaniyi Saidi, 43; and Babangida Suleiman, 47  -  of no fixed addresses, are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges. Police prosecutor, Peter Nwangwu, told the court on Tuesday that the men committed the offences between January 2017 and April at NASCON Allied Industries PLC, Ikosi, Ketu, Lagos. Nwangwu alleged that the accused persons conspired with others still at large to steal some quantities of diesel oil valued at N92m, property of NASCON Allied Industries. They were, however, apprehended by the police after investigation, he said. Chief Magistrate Y.O. Aje-Afunwa ordered the accused persons to provide two sureties each as part of the bail conditions. Aje-Afunwa said one of the sureties must be a blood relation of the accused and should be gainfully employed with an evidence of tax payments to the Lagos State government. She fixed August 8, 2018 for trial.
