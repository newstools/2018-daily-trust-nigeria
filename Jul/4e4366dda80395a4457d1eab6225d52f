Parents have been called upon to inculcate the values of integrity, honesty, love and fear of God to their children. This call was made by the Director of Val-De-Mauris Academy, Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed at the school fourth graduation ceremony, in Abuja recently. Tanko said the gesture would go a long way in addressing menace of corruption and insecurity in the country. “Our appeal to parent is to make sure that they inculcate the values of integrity, honesty, love and fear of God to their children. It is very important to note that we can only succeed in doing that by imbibing the said values ourselves. “The most serious challenges facing Nigeria today are corruption and insecurity. We can only fight corruption and win if we inculcate the values of integrity, honesty and fear of God in our minds and minds of our children,” he said. According to him, the current high level of insecurity and general bloodletting in Nigeria were direct results of hate rage that agents of disunity were promoting as well as injustices prevalent in the society. The Director of the school described Nigeria as a blessed country with every potential to be a great nation. He however, lamented that lack of good leadership and negative value system were drawing the country backwards.
