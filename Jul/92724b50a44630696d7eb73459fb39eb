President Muhammadu Buhari said his administration would reorganise the judiciary to enhance the anti-graft war. Buhari disclosed this at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday during a joint press conference with the visiting Namibian President, Hage Geingob. President Buhari said it was difficult to fight corruption in a multi-party democracy like Nigeria’s. He said his government would dedicate some judges to handle corruption cases with a view to ensuring the prosecution of all those found guilty of graft. “So, we are winning (the fight against corruption), but it is very difficult under this multi-party democracy system. We are getting the cooperation of countries. “We are trying to sell the assets wherever we find them and bring the money into the Nigerian treasury. This is all I can say at this stage because we are reorganizing the judiciary,” he said. Geingob congratulated Buhari for his courage in fighting corruption in Nigeria and beyond. According to him, corruption is becoming a serious issue in Africa and “strong people” like Buhari are needed to eliminate it. He said he visited Nigeria to pay his last respect to late Prof Adebayo Adedeji who he described as his mentor. Adedeji, a one-time Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission of Africa, who died on April 25, will be buried on July 7.
