Renowned Islamic scholar and Lagos Commissioner for Home Affairs, Dr. Abdulhakeem Abdullateef has charged both Christian and Muslim preachers to avoid hate preaching while on the pulpit. Abdullateef also described recent killings across the country as senseless and condemnable, saying however that the killings were not religious.  Speaking with Daily Trust after delivering the Friday (Juma’at) sermon at the Lagos Secretariat Central Mosque, Alausa Ikeja, the scholar said those behind the killings were simply criminals who should be treated as so.  He reiterated that Islam forbids killings in all ramifications and no Muslim conscious of Allah would take the lives of others.  The commissioner said, “All of us should remember Allah. If we remember Allah in all we do, it would be difficult to take the lives of others."  “Allah loves us and he preserves us. So in our dealings, let remember Allah. The preachers must avoid hate preaching. They must avoid setting Nigerians up against one another."  “The Christians, the Muslims who are religious leaders must understand that they are standing at the temples of Allah and they must ensure that they talk about how we can live together amicably, not engaging in man’s inhumanity to man. So all the atrocities across the country are condemnable, Islam does not support it. No Muslim can in the name of Allah kill if Allah himself is preserving our lives”.  He said the parents must be conscious of God in bringing up their children, adding, “In relating with other members of the family, remember Allah. All of us should be mindful of what connects us. So we are talking of tolerance, peaceful coexistence and harmonious relationship”.
