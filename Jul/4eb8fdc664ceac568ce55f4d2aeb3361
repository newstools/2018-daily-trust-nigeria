The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Wednesday held national prayers session in Abuja to expressed anger against the killing of Christians in the Middle Belt and other parts of the country by alleged armed herdsmen. The prayer session which attracted Christian leaders across the country witnessed outpouring of prayers and emotions over the killings in Adamawa, Benue, Plateau, Kaduna, Nasarawa and Taraba states and some states in the southern part of the country. CAN President, Dr. Supo Ayokunle said the increasing cases of killings in the country has almost made Nigeria a deserted land and that the killings were already becoming an embarrassment. “The church is one, the church wants the best for the country and the church wants the carnage to stop,” Ayokunle said. On his part, the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan called for unity among Christians and Nigerians. “There was no need to allow divisions to make it difficult for us to work together for things that are good. At the higher level, efforts are been made for Christians to come together and unite with one voice,” Onaiyekan said. Also, Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Ministry, Dr Paul Enenche said, “Adversity brings unity, it is all agreed that everyone is in a crisis situation; we are also trusting God for a perfect plan ahead of the coming year. The primary objective of government is the protection of lives and property, and all we can say is that the leadership of the country should do more in securing lives and properties.”
