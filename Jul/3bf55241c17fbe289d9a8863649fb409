The House of Representatives on Wednesday resolved to probe all the recovered funds said to have been stolen by late Head of State, Sani Abacha.

While adopting a motion by Sunday Karimi (PDP, Kogi), the house said the probe would include the utilization of the funds from 1998 to date.

The House also resolved that the Federal Government should ensure the payment of Â the sum of $322m recently paid by the Swiss Government into the country's consolidated revenue account.

The lawmakers, after long debate on the matter, also urged the Executive arm to send a supplementary budget so that the Federal Government's share of the money could be used in fixing the Ajaokuta Steel Company.
