A 56-year-old businesswoman, Grace Okonwa, has urged an Agege, Lagos, customary court, to dissolve her 33-year-old marriage to her husband over allegations of cultism, assault and adultery. Grace, a native of Agbor, Delta State, told the court at the weekend she had discovered her husband, Macaulay Okonwa, was a cultist and she no longer loved him. The mother of six, who resides at the Command, Ipaja area of Lagos, said “My husband belongs to the Ogboni Confraternity. He is devilish and demonic. Whenever he has sexual intercourse with me, my stomach swells up and when l go to the hospital for a check-up, it is confirmed there is nothing wrong with me.” The petitioner also alleged that Okonwa was always attacking her and the children spiritually and had used his “devilish powers” to stop the children from getting married. She said, “I am no longer interested in the union.” The court noted that the respondent had refused to appear in court after several summons had been sent to him. The court’s president, Mrs Ibironke Elabor, adjourned the case till August 14, 2018 for judgement.
