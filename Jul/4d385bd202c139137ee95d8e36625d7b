The chairman, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), FCT chapter, Rev. Isaac Komolafe, has called on Christians to continue to pray for peace to take centre stage in the country. He made the call at the Multi-Zonal Pastors and Workers conference held in Abuja yesterday. Komolafe advocated for good neighbourliness in the nation so that citizens would enjoy relative peace. He said the current challenges in the country should not be seen as permanent, adding that with prayers and necessary changes, Nigeria would overcome its problems. The clergyman said it was high time the government did something to ameliorate the suffering of local communities by putting a stop to the incessant killing and maiming unarmed locals before it got out of hand. “The primary responsibility of the government is to protect lives and property. As a church and Christian body, we are also ready to support them and pray for them. One of the things we are suggesting to the government is that they should be fair in all that they do to the citizens of this country. “On the issue of corruption, we are speaking to the people at the National Assembly that they should live to the expectations of the people who voted for them to represent them” he said. The PFN chairman urged Christians to participate actively in the upcoming elections, adding that they should all get their Permanent Voters Cards in order to exercise their civic responsibility. “Yes, INEC will not count prayer points but ballot papers. We are praying and mobilizing our members to collect their voters cards. They should cast their votes and ensure that nobody buys their votes. We have urged them to vote appropriately for people that will move us from where we are to where we want to be,” he said.
