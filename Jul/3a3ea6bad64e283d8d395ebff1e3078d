The Debt Management Office (DMO) said a new Strategic Plan that would deliver robust and all-encompassing strategy is at final stage of preparation. The Director-General of agency, Ms Patience Oniha disclosed this in a statement issued to newsmen in Abuja on yesterday. She refuted claims in “A report published by a national daily that the country had no debt management strategy.” Oniha said “Contrary to the publication, Nigeria has a duly approved Debt Management Strategy and the document is available on our website.” She urged the public to disregard the report, saying the Federal Government was implementing the nation’s debt management strategy in full. While describing the publication as false the DG also said the enquiry by the Newspaper was on the DMO’s Strategic Plan (an institutional plan) and not the Public Debt Management Strategy. “There is a difference between the Debt Management Strategy and the DMO’s Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan is a statement of the institution’s Goals and Objectives as well as, the activities that will enable their achievements” she said.
