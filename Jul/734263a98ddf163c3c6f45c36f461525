The Nigerian Army on Monday denied reports that Boko Haram attacked Adamawa State at the weekend and hoisted a flag after the attack. In a statement signed by the Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Texas Chukwu, he added that the report published by a National newspaper, was not only untrue but also misleading.  He described the report as a calculated attempt to drag the Nigerian Army into the mud despite its numerous successes recorded against the Boko Haram Terrorists.  He added that ‎a large number of civilian populace have returned to their ancestral homes where farming, fishing and other economic activities have commenced.  The statement read in part, ‎"While the Nigerian Army would not join issues with  the Daily Sun reporter in Yola, certain facts must be reported with dignity.  " It is on record that successes so far achieved in the North East are internationally acknowledged."  "The Daily Sun is please advised to retract the story as it is an attempt to erode all the gains the Nigerian Army and  other  security agencies  have so far achieved".  He called on the public to disregard the said publication and go about their lawful activities and advised  media practitioners to always cross checked their facts before rushing to the press.
