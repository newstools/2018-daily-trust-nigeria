An aspirant vying for a ticket for Abuja South Federal Constituency in the 2019 elections on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ahmad Abubakar Sadiq, has donated air conditioners to Kwali General Hospital. The House of Representatives aspirant, while presenting the air conditioners said it was meant for the delivery room to ease the pains of women during child birth. “And you can recall that two or three weeks ago, I was at this hospital where I paid hospital bills of some indigent patients on admission,” he added. The aspirant called on philanthropists and wealthy individuals to always support the less privileged and vulnerable people in the society. The hospital’s Chief Medical Director, Dr Halima Bello, represented by the acting medical director, Dr Orji Samuel, commended the House of Representatives aspirant for the gesture, saying the donation will help in reducing stress at the labour room. City News reports that the aspirant also went round the hospital wards to give undisclosed cash amounts to some patients on admission.
