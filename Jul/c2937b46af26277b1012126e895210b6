India has published a list which effectively strips about four million people in the north-eastern state of Assam of their citizenship. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, a day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. But it has sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. Fearing violence, officials say that no-one will face immediate deportation. They say that a lengthy appeal process will be available to all - even if it means millions of families will live in limbo until they get a final decision on their legal status.
