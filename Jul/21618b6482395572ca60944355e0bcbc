Iran has vowed to thwart US efforts to block its oil exports by allowing private companies to export crude oil. Eshaq Jahangiri, Iran’s first vice president, also warned rival OPEC producer Saudi Arabia that it would never take Tehran’s “place” on the international oil market. “We will surely do something to thwart the US rallying cry that Iranian oil [exports] must be stemmed,” Jahangiri said in a speech during an economic event broadcast on state television. “The [Iranian] government has a plan ... and God willing we are certain that we will be able to sell as much oil as we want,” Jahangiri added. Iran is looking at ways to keep exporting oil after US President Donald Trump’s administration threatened to impose sanctions on Iran’s business partners if they do not cut Iranian oil imports to “zero” by November 4, in an attempt to further isolate Tehran politically and economically.
