Over 500 healthcare workers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have been trained to tackle cases of infant mortality. The healthcare workers were trained by the FCT branch of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) at a workshop held on Tuesday in Kwali. The NMA Local Organizing Committee chairman, Dr Ayoku Emeka, said the training was part of its corporate social responsibility to strengthen primary health care services and also empower medical personnel with the necessary skills to reduce high rate of infant mortality. Dr. Eyinade Olateju, Course Director of the workshop, said the training was apt, coming at a time when Nigeria was rated as the highest neonatal death country in Africa and second in the world. Olateju who decried the death of 700 infants daily in the country, identified prematurity, breathing problem, new-born jaundice and infection as the causes of neonatal deaths.
