The Chairman of Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators of Nigerian (ICSAN) Samuel Kolawole has asked the public and private organisations in the country to promote corporate governance as means of achieving growth. Kolawole made the call at the 44th Annual General Meeting of the institution yesterday. He said “To attract foreign investments into the country, they want to be sure of what we are doing and confidence that they are safe. So, any organisation that is involved in promoting good corporate governance is helping to build the economy because corporate governance helps to build the trust in the economy that when they bring their money there won’t be issue of mismanagement. “In the institute, corporate governance is one of the modules that confer the right to be a member. There are numerous members of the institute holding several key positions in the private sector and are putting to use, the key elements of good corporate governance. “We are engaging government, civil service across the country to ensure that those who are in charge of the affairs in this country understand what corporate governance is all about and they’re encouraged to apply the corporate governance practices to ensure that the nation moves forward,” he said. Giving account of his stewardship, Kolawole said his administration has improved on legacy laid by its predecessors.
