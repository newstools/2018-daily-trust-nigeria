There was palpable calm in most towns and villages of Ekiti state ahead of tomorrow’s governorship election holding in the state. Most towns and villages visited by our reporter were peaceful as residents go about their normal daily activities without any disturbance. Daily Trust can authoritatively report that heavily armed security personnel were stationed in most places across the length and breadth of the state to curtail any act of public disturbance. At the INEC LGA office in Aramoko Ekiti, residents were seen checking their names on the voters’ register displayed on the wall.  A resident of Iyin Ekiti who simply identified himself as Ishola said there’s no cause for alarm regarding tomorrow’s gubernatorial poll as the people are ready to vote for the candidates of their choice. A corn seller, Abosede Ajayi, who spoke with Daily Trust in Efon Alaye also corroborated Ishola’s view. “Everywhere is peaceful here contrary to what’s been reported in the media. And it will be same tomorrow too. Or did you see anyone fighting or disturbing public peace around here?” She queried. When our reporter on Friday morning visited Ado Ekiti, the state capital, residents were unperturbed as they go to their different work places or ply their trades. In some areas like Ajilosun and Adebayo in the metropolis, some jubilant residents expressed their eagerness to cast their votes tomorrow.  Our reporter also noticed the arrival of some parties’ bigwigs in few convoys in the city, without sirens. A resident of Igbalaye area near the state hospital, Mrs. Adebisi, assured Daily Trust that the election will be very peaceful despite the pre-election tension that greeted the air outside the state. “There won’t be any trouble in Ekiti state, especially in this Ado Ekiti. We love peace and we’re determined to vote whoever we want as our next governor,” she said.
