Lagos State Commissioner of Police Imohimi Edgal said yesterday that the command will ensure that the Funsho Williams Avenue and Oshodi Apapa expressway are not locked down by drivers of petroleum tankers and haulage trucks. Edgal, in a telephone chat with Daily Trust, described the activities of the truck drivers as embarrassment to the state and Federal Governments. The command in conjunction with other security agencies had embarked on consultations with stakeholders to find a lasting solution to the problem. Edgal said: “Sequel to the activities of the petroleum tankers and haulage trucks drivers, along the Funsho Williams Avenue and Oshodi/Apapa Expressway, which have continued to cause a perennial gridlock on the affected roads and constitute a serious embarrassment to the State and Federal Governments, the Command embarked on series of consultations with the Stakeholders in order to find a lasting solution to the problem and its attendant consequences on the law abiding citizens plying the routes. “In the same vein, the Command in conjunction with the Union leaders will continue to engage the cynical drivers to key into the operation in the interest of the public. Meanwhile, the exercise has been extended by 48 hours,” Edgal said.
