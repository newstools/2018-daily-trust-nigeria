Lawyers for the Sudanese teenager who killed her husband after he allegedly raped her have filed an appeal in the Supreme Court to demand her unconditional release. Judges last month scrapped the death sentence imposed on Noura Hussein, 19, and sentenced her to five years in prison. Judges also ordered the payment of $18,600 (£14,000) to the family of her late husband, Abdulrahman Mohamed Hammad. The original sentence had caused outrage, and international celebrities like Naomi Campbell and Emma Watson backed an online campaign, #JusticeforNoura, to demand her release. In a statement, Faiza Mohamed, the Africa director of campaign group Equality Now, said: “Noura has suffered enough! One cannot be married off as a child, brutally raped and still be asked to serve a prison term and pay a fine over and above that.
