Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi  has commended the Federal Government for  recruiting  7,425 unemployed graduates from the state into the second  batch of  the N-Power programme. Bello,  in a statement in Lokoja on Tuesday, said that the programme  had  given hope to the beneficiaries who were selected on merit from the  21 local government councils  of the state.

Those selected were mostly from indigent  background,  the governor  said in the statement signed by Adoga Ibrahim, the Coordinator of the  N-Power programme in the state. Bello also commended President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President  Yemi Osinbajo for the introduction of the N-Power scheme under which  beneficiaries are entitled to  a N30,000 stipend per month. He re-affirmed the support of the people and government of Kogi State for the president. “  We will work to strengthen the effort of the President Buhari  led-administration by ensuring that the beneficiaries are deployed to  critical areas that will impact on the development of the state,” Bello  was quoted as saying. He urged the beneficiaries to give their best services to the nation and refrain from any form of misconduct.(NAN)
