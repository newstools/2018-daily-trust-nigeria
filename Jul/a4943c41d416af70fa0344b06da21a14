A businessman, Saheed Rasheed, who had approached the Oja-Oba, Ibadan, customary court with a prayer that the court dissolve his seven-year-old marriage over allegation that his wife was too quarrelsome, has had his request granted. The president of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade, on Friday dissolved the marriage and granted the custody of the child in the marriage to the defendant. Chief Odunade ordered the plaintiff to be paying the child the sum of N3,000 monthly as feeding allowance through the court, and also instructed him to be responsible for his education and health. In his petition, Rasheed told the court that his wife, Taye, was a troublesome person who was always fighting with friends, neighbours and families. He said she was also divulging the family’s secrets to neighbours. Besides, Taye, he alleged, did not respect his parents and relations as expected in a marriage in Yorubaland. He further said his wife invited the police to arrest him, alleging he was threatening her life with deadly weapons, which he maintained was a lie. Defending herself, the respondent, who accepted the divorce claims, said it was true she reported him to some of his friends because “he is not a responsible husband.” She said, “He was always abusing my parents, and threatened to hurt me with a cutlass. That was why I reported him to the police so that he won’t kill me. I didn’t fight with people in our neighbourhood as he claimed. Sir, my child is too small and I don’t want to release him for his father. I am also tired of living with him.”
