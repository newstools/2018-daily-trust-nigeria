A former Kaduna State governor, Brigadier General Lawal Jafaru Isa (rtd) has said that his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari  remains cordial. Addressing supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) during a special meeting held at his residence in Kano yesterday, Isa said contrary to speculations, his   relationship with the president is intact. General Isa said, “I have heard so many things about my relationship with Buhari, but I want to make it clear today that my relationship with him is cordial. He is my boss and I respect him. “I have been supporting him in all his political undertakings and I will continue to support him. The meeting we held today is part of our efforts to support his second term bid. “I summoned all APC members for this meeting with a view to strengthening unity among ourselves. Members of Kwankwasiyya, Gandujiyya, Legacy and other APC groups attended the meeting. And the essence of the meeting is to unite so that together, we can support President Buhari.” Isa said though he has been receiving calls to contest for the Senate, the meeting had nothing to do with that. “I thank those who are urging me to seek the Senate seat, but I have not yet decided. For now, my concern is to support Buhari and I will remain committed to this course until his second term bid is achieved,” he said.
