Senator George Akume, a former governor of Benue State, yesterday, held a closed door meeting with the Deputy National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Sen. Lawali Shuaibu. Akume was said to have been summoned by the APC national leadership following the declaration by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, on Monday, that the party had given him “a red card”. Governor Ortom, whose seeming loss of state party structure to Akume was cited as the reason for his remarks, was conspicuously absent at the meeting. After the meeting, the former governor, who was seen off by Sen. Shuaibu, declined to comment on the outcome of the talks. He, however, said that he would re-visit the party secretariat today (Wednesday). Asked to speak on the outcome of the meeting, Akume said, “Today, I have a very lower voice. I’m coming back. We are coming back. We will be here tomorrow (today).”
