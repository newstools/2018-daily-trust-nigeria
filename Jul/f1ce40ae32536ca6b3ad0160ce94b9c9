A staff member of the Kano Electricity Distribution Company, simply identified as Mannir, was yesterday electrocuted while trying to fix a fault. The incident, according to sources, happened along the Dutsima road beside the Ahmadu Belo Housing Estate in the metropolis. “He was working on an insulator when power was restored to the line and he fell unconscious before being rushed to the hospital where he gave up”, a staff member of the company who pleaded anonymity said. He said the incident had been reported at Batagarawa police divisional office. Efforts to get the spokesman of the police, SP Gambo Isah, proved abortive. The victim, said to have since been buried, is survived by a wife and four children.
