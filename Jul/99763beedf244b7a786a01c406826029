The clamour for the review of heads of security infrastructure without putting necessary structural policies in place could be equated to placing the cart before the horse, former governor of Niger state, Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu has said. Aliyu made this call yesterday in Abuja at the 12th Annual International Conference of the Society for Peace Studies and Practice (SPSP) with the theme, “Violent conflicts and the challenges of peace-building in contemporary Nigeria”. He said the intellectual community has a role to play by making sure that options are given to the policy makers to adopt.
