The Judge of State High Court sitting in Jos, Justice Daniel Longji has warned ex-Governor David Jonah Jang of Plateau state against late coming to court. Jang came to court four minutes late after the judge had started sitting at 9am today. It recalled that Economic Financial and Crime Commission (EFCC) has arraigned Jang and Pam Yusuf, a former cashier in the Office of the Secretary to the Plateau State Government before Jos State High Court on a 12 count charge bordering on alleged corruption, fraud and misappropriation of N6.3 billion belonging to Plateau state. In today's sitting, while facing Jang who was standing in a trial box, Justice Longji warned the ex-governor that the court wouldn't tolerate late coming. He said, "You are no longer a governor and here is court therefore you must respect court and you shouldn't allow me to sit before you come in. "I remember when I was a Commissioner, when a governor calls us and asked us to meet him at somewhere, we have to be there before he comes." He said. The judge then adjourned the case to 30th, 31st October and 1st November, 2018 for a definite hearing.
