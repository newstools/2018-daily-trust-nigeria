Members of the House of Representatives, who defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from All Progressive Party (APC) on Tuesday, have laughed off the dream of the APC that they will make a U-turn and return into its fold.

The members noted that the decision to dump the ruling party didn’t come easy but it came anyway, after they had weighed all other options and concluded that defection was the best.

Their reactions came on the heels of fresh reconciliation moves by the APC and alleged offer of return tickets to the members to contest the 2019 polls.

Thirty-seven lawmakers had on Tuesday defected from the APC. Thirty-two of the lawmakers defected to the PDP, while four members moved to the African Democratic Congress.

One member has yet to name his new party.

The Coordinator of the 32 defectors, Mr. Razak Atunwa, reacted angrily to the thought of returning to the APC.

Atunwa, who is the chairman, House Committee on Justice, said the APC had “limited understanding” of governance, a reason the party reduced the defection to just return ticket.

He said, “Ticket or no ticket, this is a decision that we have taken and we know this is the best.

“We are talking about fundamental national issues, lack of good governance and generally, a government that has failed to deliver on its promises to the Nigerian people.

“When you reduce it to ticket, you make this whole fight look unserious or merely which party has majority or not majority. We are talking about a government that has failed.”
