A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nasarawa State, Mr John Mamman and his supporters have defected to All Progressives Congress (APC). Mamman, a retired Permanent Secretary, spoke on Sunday at a reception organised in his honour by the executives and members of APC, Dari electoral ward of Kokona Local Government Area of the state. Mamman said he had remained a long standing “general’’ of the PDP in the state, adding that he joined PDP in May 1998. Mamman, however, said the time had come for him to move away from the PDP, adding that the APC under President Muhammadu Buhari was a better option for him. (NAN)
