The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has condemned the recent upsurge of violence in Plateau State. The body’s National Secretary, Baba Othman Ngelzarma, in a chat with our correspondent yesterday, said the violence must be condemned by all well-meaning Nigerians. Ngelzarma dissociated MACBAN from a faceless group with the name ‘Fulani Nationality Movement’ (FUNAM), which came up with a press release which he said was aimed at spreading discord between the Fulani and other Nigerians. “We make bold to say that to the best of our knowledge there is no such association in Nigeria. It was therefore hastily crafted to cash in on the unfortunate events in Jos in order to fuel the crisis further. Government should investigate this issue, find out the purveyors of such hate speech and prosecute them for their crimes against the Nigerian people,” Ngelzarma said. Ngelzarma urged the government to be fair and just to all in handling the crisis and provide necessary support and assistance to victims to reduce their suffering. According to him, MACBAN regrets that some unpatriotic citizens were bent on destroying efforts to build peace in the state.
