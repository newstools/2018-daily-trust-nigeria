Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, yesterday declared that he will run for the Presidency on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the next general elections. At a rally in Yola, Adamawa State, he vowed to unseat the All Progressives Congress (APC) government in Adamawa State and the federal level and reclaim them for the PDP. Atiku said Nigerians were disappointed with the APC-led government, ‘‘as the insecurity situation has worsened’’. “In 1998, I took this state to the PDP. Today, I have returned to take what rightly belongs to the PDP”, he stated. He berated the President Muhammadu Buhari administration ‘‘for failing to secure lives and property, thereby creating mistrust among the populace. “The APC government has failed to unite Nigeria. We are more divided now than we have ever been in our history. “They destroyed our economy. Today, we are witnessing the most insecure situation; more people have died in Nigeria than in Afghanistan.  We now have the highest unemployment rate in the history of this country; more than one million of our youths are unemployed’’. The PDP national chairman, Uche Secondus, assured party members of victory in the next election, saying Nigeria must be rescued from the present leadership. He added that many officials in the state, including legislators, members of cabinet and local government chairmen had decamped to the PDP.
