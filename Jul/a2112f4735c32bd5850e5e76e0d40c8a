The Federal Government has said that it would embark on massive religious education in the North East region, to create awareness on the dangers and consequences of insurgency, as a way of curbing the menace. The Minister of Interior, Lt. Gen Dambazau (rtd), made the declaration when the UN Under-Secretary on Counter Terrorism, Vladimir Voronkov led a delegation to his office in Abuja on Tuesday. The Minister noted that the greatest challenge of the region is ignorance of what the religion and the law stipulates, adding that the perpetrators of evil capitalize on it to influence the youth in the Zone to carry out their evil motives and ambition, thus making them to maim and kill at the slightest opportunity. Gen. Dambazau said further that the land degradation as a result of desertification in the Zone makes the rural farmers, a prey as they are easily recruited into the terrorism group, having no serious business to hold onto especially when the dry season sets in. The Minister who stressed that terrorism was a global issue deserving global attention, called for the cooperation of all countries, even in the fight to stamp it out, adding that technological innovation was needed both to cover the ground as well as air because of the porous nature of the borders. He added that in Nigeria, more efforts are being made to check the menace through the provision of identity number on the national ID cards, biometric capturing of migrants as well as insertion of security features on the nationâ€™s international passport. Speaking earlier, the UN-Under Secretary on counter terrorism, Vladimir Voronkov said that the purpose of the visit was to explore possible areas of collaboration and intervention with Nigerian Government, so as to find possible ways of addressing the threat of insurgency in the region. He called for constant dialogue among member-border countries, emphasizing that inter-Agency collaboration would also accelerate the efforts towards curbing the menace.
