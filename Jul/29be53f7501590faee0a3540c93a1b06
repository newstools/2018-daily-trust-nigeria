The National Board for Technical Education, in collaboration with Commonwealth of Learning, has reviewed the policy on Open, Distance and Flexible Learning (ODFL) for Polytechnics in Nigeria. Speaking in Kaduna yesterday after a three-day meeting to review the draft policy with relevant stakeholders, the executive secretary of the board, Mas’ud Kazaure said the final document would be submitted to the governing board of NBTE for vetting before forwarding it to the National Council on Education  for approval. Kazaure, represented by a director at NBTE, Abbati Mohamed, had earlier stated that 29 polytechnics had been recommended to pioneer the ODFL. COL consultant, Philip Uys, described the policy as the only solution to alternative delivery of technical education to the Nigerian youths. The policy, according to him, seeks to open access to technical education using modern technology including mobile phones and computers among others.
