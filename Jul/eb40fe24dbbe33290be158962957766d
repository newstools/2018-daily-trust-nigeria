President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday commissioned the Abuja light rail system, describing it as a promise kept. Speaking during the commissioning, Buhari described the project as a dream come-true. He said it would address the challenges of transportation in the FCT. “This accomplishment clearly demonstrates our commitment to addressing critical infrastructural projects and keeping with the ideals of the Change Agenda to ensure prudence in the management of public resources, value for money considering the huge investments in this project,” he said. The President, while describing transportation as the live wire of any city, expressed optimism that a modern rail service would boost the FCT economy and greatly enhance social life. “ I am aware that what we have on ground today are coaches meant to provide skeletal services as we await the main set of the rolling stock for full operations. I have been briefed on the outcome of the ministers of FCT and Finance recent visit to China, during which the MoUs and agreements for the procurements of the main rolling stock were signed,” he said. Buhari assured Nigerians of Federal Government’s continued support for all the negotiations towards the realization of the Abuja light rail system.
