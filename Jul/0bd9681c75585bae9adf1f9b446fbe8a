Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has commiserated with families, friends, colleagues and associates of those who lost loved ones in senseless killings across the country. This was contained in a statement signed by the Senior Special Adviser to Governor Tambuwal, Malam Abu Shekara. The statement read: “Indeed, the growing spate of mindless shedding of innocent blood, especially of policemen and other security personnel on their lawful duty has brought a new dimension to the reprehensible state of insecurity in the country.” Governor Tambuwal further recalled that last May, three policemen were shot dead in Sokoto State by kidnappers, who abducted a Syrian national they were escorting. A few days later, four police officers were ambushed and killed in Benue State. “This is happening amidst repeatedly reported cases of attacks on police stations and other security facilities in various parts of the country,” he said, adding that the killings were avoidable.
