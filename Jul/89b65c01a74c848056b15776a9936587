Nigeria Prisons Service in Niger has denied news of an outbreak of cholera and tuberculosis causing the death of three inmates in Kontagora prison Prisons spokesperson Rabiu Shuaibu said the report was false, malicious and unpatriotic. “There is no outbreak of any disease in Kotangara prison or any of our facilities across the state,” he said. “The two inmates that passed on in the prison were brought in with complications of liver cirrhosis and gastroenteritis. “Though the prison medical team tried to manage the situation, unfortunately their cases were already precarious before their admission. “Contrary to the report, it is also important to know that the condemned inmate, Ali Riskuwa alleged to have lost his life in the imaginary outbreak is alive and in safe custody.”
