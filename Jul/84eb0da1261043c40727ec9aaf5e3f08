An Egyptian court on Thursday convicted 37 people on charges related to illicit trading in human organs and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from three to 15 years in jail, witnesses said. The Cairo Criminal Court also cleared three people in the case involving a total of 41 people, including doctors, nurses and middlemen who were rounded up during a 2016 raid in which millions of dollars were recovered. The raid was part of an investigation that focused on private hospitals and health centers, both licensed and unlicensed, where transplants and organ harvesting took place, the health ministry said at the time.
