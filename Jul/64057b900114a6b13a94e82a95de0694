The National chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole has said that Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and all those who decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have no electoral value.

Speaking to State House Correspondents after a meeting with President Muhmmadu Buhari, he said APC is not worried with the defection at both Senate and House of Representatives.

Daily Trust reports that over 50 lawmakers defected from the APC to PDP at both Senate and the House of Representatives.

Oshiomhole who said the party would always listen to genuine grievances, said, "We have a lot of big masquerades without electoral value."

He said the President got more votes than the defectors in their constituencies during the 2015 polls.
