Former president Olusegun Obasanjo said the 1999 Constitution should be amended to include 40 per cent slots for women in the National Assembly and other levels of governance. Presenting a paper titled, “Nigerian Democracy and the Journey So far: The Role of Women” at the 70th birthday of former minister of women affairs, Mrs Josephine Anenih yesterday in Abuja, Obasanjo said ýthe nation’s democracy would grow at low pace without the active participation of women. “The health of our democracy can be judged by the participation of women. The low number of women at the National Assembly is unacceptable and makes mockery of gender balance.” Prominent politicians at the event were; former governors of Jigawa and Anambra states, Sule Lamido and Peter Obi.
