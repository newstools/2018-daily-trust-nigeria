Hundreds of migrant parents are no longer in the US, government lawyers said, ahead of a deadline to reunite families. Administration lawyers told a federal court more than 450 parents had gone, with the government unable to say if they had been deported. The Trump administration recently halted its policy of separating migrant families at the border with Mexico. A court ordered that it must now reunite children with their parents. Federal court judge Dana Sabraw has ruled that all 2,300 detained minors be brought back to their families by 26 July. On Tuesday he said the government was on track to complete the task by that deadline and praised the government’s “remarkable achievement” of returning the majority of children rapidly.
