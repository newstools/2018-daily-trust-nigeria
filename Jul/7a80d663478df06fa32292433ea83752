The FCT Administration (FCTA) has received a prototype cold store constructed by the European Union Support to Immunisation Governance in Nigeria (EU-SIGN) in Apo district of Abuja. The FCT Secretary, Health and Human Services, Barr. Amanda Pam, represented by the Executive Secretary, PHC Development Board, Dr. Rilwanu Mohammed, who received the cold store, said another cold room would soon be constructed on a piece of land recently acquired for the purpose. He said the new prototype cold store is fully equipped with a stand by generator and that three zonal cold rooms would also be constructed. He also commended the EU-SICNÂ  project for the about N100 million spent in procuring nine direct drive solar refrigerators, a vehicle and the renovation of two health facilities in the FCT. The goal of the EU-SIGN project, he said, is to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality in Nigeria due to preventable diseases with specific objectives of ensuring that sustainable quality routine immunization services are permanently available through an effective system to support the interruption of the polio virus.
