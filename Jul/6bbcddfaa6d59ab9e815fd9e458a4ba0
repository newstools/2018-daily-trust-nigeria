The Nigerian Union of Pensioners, New Nigerian Newspaper branch has decried the non-payment of their monthly pension and accrued pension arrears; saying over 180 pensioners have died while waiting for their money.

According to the secretary of the union, Albert Bosa Iweka Esq, the New Nigerian Newspaper pensioners are owed 15 years pension arrears; noting that between year 2011 to date, 180 pensioners have died while waiting for their payment. 

While he thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for the approval of the sum of N2.1billion in February 2017 for the payment of pension to retirees of the newspaper; he lamented that up till now, they were yet to receive any payment even after the verification exercise by the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) in October, 2017. 

“The reason for non-payment of the pension is best known to the Federal Ministry of Finance which has bluntly refused to release the fund. 

"This is in spite of a subsisting court judgement delivered on October 28, 2013 directing the federal government and the New Nigerian Newspaper to pay the outstanding arrears and monthly pension of the retirees which informed the approval of N2.1billion by the President,” he said.

He therefore appealed for urgent intervention in the matter in order to save the lives of the pensioners and their army of dependants.
