A charity organisation under the auspices of Zakat and Sadaqat Foundation has disbursed the proceeds of zakat worth N6.5 million to needy persons drawn from all parts of the state. No fewer than 229 beneficiaries, including the aged, received cash and materials such as sewing machines, deep freezers, generators and clippers from the foundation during an event in Ede. The Director of the Zakat and Sadaqat Foundation, Alhaji Sulaiman Olagunju, explained to our correspondent that the cash and materials disbursed were dues collected from rich Muslims in the state. Olagunju noted that the purpose of zakat in Islam was to eradicate poverty among the poor members of the society, saying many needy persons had so far benefited from the programme. “One hundred and seventy elders comprising both males and females from the Osogbo and Ede axes received varying amounts, just as the youths also benefited from the empowerment exercise across the state,” he said.
