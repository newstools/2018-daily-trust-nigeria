The Wuye Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP Patrick Okwarandu, has said the division was collaborating with members of the vigilante group and Eminent Police Persons Forum to tackle crime in the area. Speaking during an interview with our reporter yesterday, he said the division had ensured that there was synergy with the residents of the area as a strategy to maintain peace and curb crime in Wuye and its environs. He said the best way to ensure a crime free society was through community policing, whereby vigilantes and other stakeholders were part of the intelligence gathering process. He, however, cautioned vigilantes against engaging in illegal practices. The DPO assured that adequate protection of life and property of residents of Wuye and its environs would continue to be his priority.
