 The Federal Government has queried the Nigerian Ambassador to Israel for reportedly attending the Monday's relocation of the United States' embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. A Presidency official on Tuesday night told State House correspondents that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, queried the ambassador. The relocation of the American embassy had infuriated Palestinians and elicited widespread regional condemnation. The Presidency said Nigeria was not present at the embassy relocation ceremony as reported by AlJazeera. The presidency official, who craved anonymity, said the Federal Goverment had asked AlJazeera to retract its report that Nigeria was represented at the event. The official stated: “Based on that report, the minister queried the ambassador to explain why he attended the event. “The ambassador has since replied that he was not at the event. “It was on the strength of the ambassador’s response that the Federal Government wrote to AlJazeera to retract its story.”
