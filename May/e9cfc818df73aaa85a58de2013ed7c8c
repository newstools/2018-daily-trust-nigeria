The Chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) and Governor of Zamfara State Abdulâ€™aziz Yari yesterday commissioned two roads in Jahun and Gagarawa local government areas of Jigawa State. Yari was in the state on the invitation of Governor Muhammadu Badaru Abubakar as part of the on-going democracy day celebration. He said he was happy to have noticed the popularity of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state going by the mass turnout of people in the two LGAs. He commended the Jigawa State governor for delivering such giant projects, saying that in 2015 when the present APC-led government took over power, the financial position of the country was scary. Yari said Governor Badaru should also get set for a similar exercise in Zamfara State soon. In his remark, the Jigawa State governor attributed the success of his government to the good leadership style of President Muhammadu Buhari, who was able to support states with additional financial assistance from Paris Club money and budget support.
