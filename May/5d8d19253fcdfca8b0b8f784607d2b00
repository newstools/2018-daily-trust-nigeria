The National Assembly will today transmit the approved 2018 Appropriation Bill to President Muhammadu Buhari. Senate President Bukola Saraki gave this assurance at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja last night. Saraki was speaking to State House correspondents after he and senators broke Ramadan fast with President Buhari. Asked when the budget would be transmitted to Buhari, the Senate President responded: “I think that should have been done. “We had to harmonise, it is just a slight difference, it has been passed yesterday (Wednesday), it was in the rules and proceedings of today (yesterday). “So, I am sure by tomorrow (today), we will transmit it to the Presidency,” The Minister of Budget and National Planning, Udoma Udoma, had, after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, said the National Assembly was yet to transmit the budget to Buhari for assent. Udoma had assured that once the budget is transmitted to the executive, it would be promptly examined and worked on. The National Assembly had last Wednesday passed  the 2018 budget, increasing the proposal of N8.612 trillion presented by Buhari in December last year to N9.120 trillion.
