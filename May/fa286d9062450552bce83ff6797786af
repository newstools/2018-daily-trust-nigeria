The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has said it will soon embark on impounding trailers with extra head lamps  and prosecute drivers arrested with such vehicles. The FRSC Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi, who disclosed the measure at a meeting of the national executives of the National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) yesterday’s in Abuja, also said tanker drivers who carry tomatoes and fire wood on their trucks would be prosecuted. He said the commission had already set June, 1, 2018 to commence the clampdown, adding that only headlights fixed by manufacturers of the trucks would be allowed. He said the extra headlights often affected other road users. Oyeyemi also noted that the tomatoes transported on petrol tankers were harmful to health and largely not consumable, stressing that such tomatoes were largely responsible for cholera in the country. The FRSC boss said there was need for the transport unions to adhere to the speed limit prescribed in 2017, while encouraging the members to ensure that their drivers avoided carrying firewood on tankers. He acknowledged that the use of speed limiters had helped in reducing the rate of road crashes, especially on major highways in the country. “We have noticed very high compliance among operators of articulated vehicles and it is my hope that those that are yet to install the device in their vehicles will immediately embrace the policy to save the nation from the avoidable menace of speed induced crashes,” he said. Also speaking, the national chairman of NARTO, Alhaji Kasim Ibrahim, said it was clear that government alone could not maintain the road network across the country. He urged the private sector to support government in fixing some of the bad roads.
