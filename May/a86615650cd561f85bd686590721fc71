The Osun State Governor, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, has said that he would not leave Osun State after serving out  his second term and that he would assist his successor to run the state. Aregbesola said this yesterday during his all-night interactive session tagged ‘Ogbeni Till Day Break’ in Osogbo, the state capital, where he assured the people of the state that his successor would sustain his legacy. He said that when he completes his tenure and hand over to another democratically-elected governor on November 27, 2018, he would make himself available to the next governor for advice. Aregbesola said that despite the fact that he has only 200 days more to spend as the chief executive of the state, he would put concerted efforts in place to put finishing touches to his legacy projects. “I’m not leaving this state after the expiration of my tenure. My successor will be better than I am. I won’t leave him, I will be behind the scenes offering him support. “We have 200 days left in office and we intend to make the best use of that time to further better the lot of the Osun people. We are not done with our plan to further develop Osun. There is still a lot more we want to do,” he said. While justifying that the current debt profile of the state was as a result of the massive infrastructural facilities provided by his administration, Aregbesola assured that he would not leave the state with any debt burden. He insisted that none of his programmes failed.
