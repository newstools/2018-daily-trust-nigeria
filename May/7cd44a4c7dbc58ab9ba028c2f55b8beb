Former Kano state Governor Ibrahim Shekarau, Ambassador Aminu Wali and Engineer Mansur Ahmed are expected to report to the Kano Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes (EFCC) today, Daily Trust has learnt. Engineer Ahmed was a former commissioner of works in Kano State and deputy campaign director (north) for the former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The three were invited in connection with the N950m campaigned fund allegedly shared among PDP members at Shekarau’s residence prior to the conduct of 2015 general elections. A source closed to the former governor said, “Shekarau, Wali and Ahmed will report to the commission’s zonal office at Hajj Camp by around 2pm today.” In May 2016, Shekarau, Wali and Ahmed were invited by the commission over the fund and their statements were taken. Daily Trust reports that Shekarau, through his media aide, Ghali Sadiq, had at the time denied collecting any share from the N950m. According to Sadiq, Ambassador Aminu Wali shared the money among PDP members at Shekarau’s residence in Kano.
