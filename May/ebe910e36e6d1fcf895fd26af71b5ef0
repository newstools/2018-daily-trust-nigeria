The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has taken its safety awareness campaign to the Universal Reformed Church of Christ (URCC) Karu, Abuja. Addressing the congregation of the church on Sunday, Anna Gbishe, an officer of the corps, said to avoid crashes occasioned by mechanical faults, it was mandatory for every motorist to check his or her vehicle before driving it out. “It is mandatory that every vehicle owner checks his or her vehicle every morning. You have to check the state of the vehicle tyres, check your brakes, check your oils, check your extinguishers, because this can lessen  the occurrence of crashes on our roads,” she said. She also advised that speed, being the number one cause of crashes on the roads, should not be violated, adding that overloading of vehicles either with people or goods was not safe. “If a car is designed to carry five persons and you insist on being the sixth person in the car, when a crash occurs, instead of losing five lives, the sixth person increases the number of lost lives. “And if a vehicle is overloaded with goods, and the vehicle had an accident, not only lives may  be lost, the goods will be destroyed, sometimes ending a person’s investment in case of commercial goods,” she added. Gbishe cautioned parents about leaving their children of below 12 years of age in the front seat of cars, saying it was safer to allow children sit at the back seat. She also advised vehicle owners to imbibe the culture of going for routine checks of their vehicles.
