More than 50 people have died after a cyclone hit Somaliland, the vice-president of the self-declared republic has said. Abdirahman Abdullahi Ismail told reporters the death toll was likely to rise, as a number of people were still missing. Tropical cyclone Sagar struck the Horn of Africa over the weekend, making landfall in Somaliand and Djibouti on Saturday. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) estimated it has affected some 669,000 people in Somaliland. Two people have also died in Puntland, and another two in Djibouti, according to UNOCHA. It added that “80% of livestock in affected areas were killed”, with reports indicating about 700 farms had been destroyed.
