Austria’s coalition government has unveiled plans to cut benefit payments for immigrants, including refugees, in a move aimed at deterring new arrivals. The main benefit payment will be capped at $655 a month, rising to match the amount Austrians receive - €863 - if they pass a German test. Immigrants will also be barred from claiming such benefits for five years. Conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, in government with the far right, has vowed a hard line on immigration. Mr Kurz campaigned in last year’s parliamentary election with pledges to cap benefits for refugees and to shut down migrant routes to Europe.
