Appointment has not been given to Senate delegation to meet President Muhammadu Buhari over the faceoff between Senate President Bukola Saraki and the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, Daily Trust has gathered. The Senate had last Wednesday raised a 10-man delegation to meet President Buhari over allegation by Saraki that the IGP was plotting to frame him up in a criminal case. Saraki told his colleagues that the police boss was plotting to implicate him in a criminal case involving cultists in Kwara State. Saraki said: “In my own view, this plot is an act of desperation, blackmail, intimidation, abuse of office and crude tactics aimed at turning our country into a police state where top officials cannot be made  to obey the law ,follow due process and subject themselves to constituted authorities.” Sequel to the alarm, a 10-man delegation was raised to meet the President. Saraki is to lead the delegation. Other members of the delegation are Ahmad Lawan, Godswill Akpabio, Olusola Adeyeye, Danjuma Goje, Abduullahi Adamu, Sam Egwu, Aliyu Wammako, Fatima Raji- Rasaki, Oluermi Tinubu. It was gathered that the delegation, which was mandated to report back on Wednesday had not made an appointment with the President. A source told Daily Trust last night that appointment has not been given to the delegation to meet Buhari. “We haven’t gone to the Villa because appointment has not been given to us. We can only go there on appointment,” he said. On whether the Senate has written the Presidency requesting for the meeting, he said: “It is the office of the Senate President that should do it and I don’t know if it has done so or not.” The spokesperson of the Senate, Sabi Aliyu Abdullahi did not reply the text message sent to him on the matter.
