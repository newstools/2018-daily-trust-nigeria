Three patients infected with the Ebola virus slipped out of an isolation ward at a hospital in the Congolese city of Mbandaka, health officials said, as medics raced to stop the deadly disease from spreading in the busy river port. Two patients left the hospital on Monday night with the help of family members, then headed to a church, the World Health Organizationâ€™s spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, told Reuters. One died at home the next day and was buried with the help of medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). The other was sent back to hospital and died that night, Kabambi said. Health Ministry sources, who asked not to be named, said two police officers had been deployed to help track them down. Another patient who was close to being discharged left on Sunday evening but was later found, Kabambi said.
