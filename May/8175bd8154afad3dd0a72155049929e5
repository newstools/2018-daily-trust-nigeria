Ma Ying-jeou, a former Taiwanese president, has been sentenced to four months in jail after being found guilty of leaking classified information when he was in office in 2013, according to Taiwan News website. The country’s high court said on Tuesday that Ma is liable for damaging the “character and rights” of Taiwanese opposition lawyer Ker Chien-ming when he leaked confidential information on him. It said that Ma, 67, violated the Communication Security and Surveillance Act. The decision overturned a Taipei district court ruling in August that cleared Ma of wrongdoing. Ma could still avoid jail time by appealing the sentence or paying a fine of 120,000 Taiwanese dollars (equivalent to $4,000). In a statement released by his office following the verdict, Ma said he would appeal the sentence.
