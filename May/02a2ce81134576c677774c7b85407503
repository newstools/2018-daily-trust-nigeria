A faction of the Kwara state APC has commended President Muhammedu Buhari for upholding the rule of law and refusal to meddle in police investigation on the alleged cult members. According to a statement issued in Ilorin on Wednesday, the state chairman of the APC faction, Hon. Bashir Bolarinwa, said the President will continue to show to Nigerians that he is still on the side of truth, integrity and rule of law. The former National Assembly member added that Kwara residents are hopeful that once and for all, the state will be free from cultism and cult clashes. However, Bolarinwa expressed dissatisfaction with undue interference coming from the high and mighty including the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and other institutions that were compromised to demean the Nigeria Police Force. He therefore, urged the Inspector General of Police to remain unruffled as he performs the constitutional duties that rest on his shoulders. The APC chairman submitted that every public office holder must strive to uphold the constitution and oath of office declaring allegiance to the state and not an individual.
