Ondo State Governor Rotimi  Akeredolu has donated equipment for the take-off of a bakery, a farm and other projects to engage corps members  posted  to the state. The governor announced the donation yesterday during a visit of some members of the NYSC Governing Board to his house led by the Vice chancellor of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Professor Joseph Eberendu. While promising to employ  and retain some of the youth corps members after their service, he said the beauty of the scheme was for members to be able to stay in the state where they served, adding that this was the reason the state government was investing in entrepreneurship. He said with the bakery and farm, they would produce the food they would eat at the orientation camp and learn to fry garri and some other things. The governor also promised to fence the NYSC  orientation camp at Ikare Akoko for  the protection of the corps members, some of who were said to have kicked against their  posting to the location  due to lack of fencing and proper security. Earlier, the state NYSC coordinator, Mrs Grace Akpabio, thanked the state government for renovating and upgrading about 15 hostels. Also speaking, the team leader of the visiting governing board, Professor Eberendu, said they wanted the corps members to be job creators and not job seekers. He stressed that with the support of the state government, the corps members would be engaged in sustainable activities.
