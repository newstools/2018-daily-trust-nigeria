Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has ordered his aides who are eyeing various elective positions in 2019 to resign or risk sack. Ortom, who gave the directive in Makurdi, urged the appointees interested in contesting the 2019 elections to resign before the 29th of this month. He said the decision was to give the affected appointees enough time to concentrate on their campaign programmes while paving way for others to assume such positions and also contribute to the development of the state. The governor, himself had expressed desire to re-contest the forthcoming election but suspended political activities following killings in the state by armed bandits since the beginning of the year. In another development, Ortom has directed the suspension of the proposed privatisation of government enterprise in the state, saying the decision was in respect of concerns raised by people of the state.
