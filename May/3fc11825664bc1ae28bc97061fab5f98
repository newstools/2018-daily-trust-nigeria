Mohamed Salah has an agreement to join Real Madrid this summer, according to sensational reports in Spain.

The 25-year-old has guided the Reds to the Champions League final, where Jurgen Klopp’s men will face Real Madrid on Saturday, May 26.

However, Spanish news outlet Don Balon claim that will likely be Salah’s last game for Liverpool, before he joins Real.

They sensationally say that Salah has an agreement to join Real with club president Florentino Perez.

Don Balon add that Real and Liverpool are yet to agree on a transfer fee for the Anfield superstar.

However, Klopp is demanding at least £175m (€200m) for the Egypt star this summer.

Don Balon also say that Real chief Perez is hoping to partner Salah alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar at the Bernabeu.
