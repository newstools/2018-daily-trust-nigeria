A statement by NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu, said Dr. Baru admitted the tremendous changes at play in the petroleum industry landscape globally, adding that  it behooved on oil companies to, as a long-time survival strategy, adapt to the changes for efficiency, growth and profitability. “The changes we are seeing in the industry over the last few years call for some action on our part. This is because as a business concern, we don’t live in isolation in the industry and therefore, we must act now,” Dr. Baru stated. According to the GMD, some of the strategies considered by the corporation included reviewing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), setting realistic targets for immediate sign-off, as well as spending items capable of improving the organisation’s bottom-line. Speaking at the meeting, the Chief Operating Officer (COO), Downstream, Engr.
