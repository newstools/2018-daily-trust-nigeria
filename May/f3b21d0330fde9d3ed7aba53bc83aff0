The Nigeria Police Force have replied the Senate over its 'Vote of no confidence' passed on the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ibrahim Idris, yesterday.

In a series of tweets by the Police on its official twitter account "@PoliceNG" on Thursday, the Police said it will not be intimidated by anyone from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.

"The Force will not be intimidated by any individual, groups or institution, constituent or otherwise to abdicate from its constitutional responsibilities of protection of lives and property and due enforcement of the rule of law, and law and order across the Country," one of the tweets read.

The Senate had yesterday passed a resolution declaring the Inspector General of Police as ‘enemy of democracy’ and unfit to hold public office in Nigeria and abroad.

The resolution was passed after a 50-minute closed session on the refusal of the police boss to appear before the Senate over the arrest of Senator Dino Melaye (APC, Kogi) and killings in some parts of the country.

The Senate had summoned the IGP on three occasions, but he snubbed the lawmakers. Yesterday was the third time fixed for the IG’s appearance but he stayed away.
