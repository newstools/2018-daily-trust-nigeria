The Federal Government has completed Sabke Dam in Mai’adua Local Government Area (LGA) of the state and handed it over to the Katsina State government for usage for water supply and irrigation. Sabke dam, with a capacity to provide one million gallons of potable water to Daura and Mai’adua communities, was initiated in 1998 by the Muhammadu Buhari-led Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) but abandoned and left to rot until last year when it was re-awarded for completion. The FG also commissioned Dutsi and Mashi water schemes with each having the capacity to provide about 250,000 gallons of treated water to Dutsi and Mashi communities. The Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, who commissioned the projects alongside other Federal Government dignitaries, said the three plants have a combined capacity to serve over 100,000 people daily. The minister also said that FG has provided for the construction of 38 borehole schemes to serve all the villages along the Sabke-Daura water transmission pipelines. Speaking earlier, Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the commissioning of these projects fit into the administration’s ongoing agenda to showcase the achievements of the Buhari administration, especially in the area of infrastructural development. He also noted that the commissioning of the water projects is the second in a week done by the Buhari administration, after the one in Edo State last Thursday. In his address, Katsina State governor, represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Mustapha Inuwa, pledged that the state will maintain and sustain the projects.
