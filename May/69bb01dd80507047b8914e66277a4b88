The Prelate of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Kalu Uche, has warned that Christians will mobilize and vote against religious bigots, tribalists, looters and wicked people into power in 2019.

However, in a swift response, the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo urged religious leaders and Nigerians to help the government to succeed.

Uche who said he alone can mobilize two million Methodist faithfuls, said he was already talking to the Pentecostals, Catholics and other Christian faithfuls to ensure that people with questionable qualities are not elected in 2019.

He spoke on Sunday in Abuja while delivering a sermon at the 2018 Interdenominational Church service titled: “I See Hope” as part of activities marking this year's Democracy Day celebration held at the National Christian Center, Abuja with the theme “Peace Building and Good Governance for Sustainable Development”. 

Uche said: “Even though it is said that the worst of democracy is better than the best form of dictatorship, under democracy, our leaders have failed, toying with the nation's democracy. Our people cannot even organize simple party primaries, what a shame.

“Peace can only come through servant leadership style, tolerance and fairness, from leaders who know that though tribes and tongues may differ, in brotherhood we stand. You know that there is no security in this country, there is so much bitterness, how can the economy thrive?”

The cleric urged the Federal Government to review the bogus salaries and allowances of those in authority downward, saying they cannot continue to be enjoying while the people suffer.

The Vice President Yemi Osinbajo urged Nigerians not to look back despite the various challenges facing the country.

According to him, Nigerians should not look back to the Egypt of corruption, division and the likes, adding that when God puts an individual or a nation on journey, he won’t tell them the inherent challenges, less they will refuse to embark on the journey.
