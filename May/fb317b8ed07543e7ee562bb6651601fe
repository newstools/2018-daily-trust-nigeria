About 37,000 candidates who applied for recruitment into the Nigeria Police yesterday took a test in English language prepared by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), the Registrar, Professor Ishaq Oloyede, said in Abuja. He said the test was conducted at 155 centres across the country and the board was hired to conduct the computer-based test to ensure fair treatment in the recruitment process. Oloyede said a number of candidates that failed the screening process for the test were disqualified while candidates that tried to evade the screening were arrested. He said the police had complied with the agreement on setting standards in recruitment examinations. Assistant Inspector General in charge of training in the Nigeria Police, Istifanus Shettima, said JAMB was assigned to conduct the test to ensure transparency in the recruitment exercise, adding that candidates did not pay money to write the test. He said successful candidates would be admitted at various training colleges across the country.
