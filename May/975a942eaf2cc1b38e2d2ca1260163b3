The Head of Service of the Federation, Winifred Oyo-Ita, has called on civil servants to sign up as champions of immunisation and primary healthcare. She spoke as the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) begins sensitisation workshops for workers in public service in hopes of attaining a “critical mass” of Nigerians to champion demand and provision of primary healthcare. In comments delivered on her behalf by Ayodele Olayemi, Oyo-Ita said it was necessary to “awaken the consciousness of Nigerians and civil servants to the realities” that besiege primary healthcare in Nigeria. Only two in 10 of some 30,000 primary health centres are functional, leaving many covered in weed, without electricity or water and unstaffed, said health minister Isaac Adewole. “We need to start from within. As mothers, and fathers, have we vaccinated our children?” Up to 4.6 million are not immunised, and only one in four Nigerians received full dosage of vaccines needed for immunity to vaccine-preventable childhood diseases. NPHCDA executive director, Faisal Shuaib called the sensitisation a better way to get Nigeria’s “engine room” of civil servants involved in primary health care.
