Hundreds of homes are to be demolished for the execution of a $200 million electricity transmission project in Ogun State. The Special Adviser to the Ogun State Governor on Energy, Mr Abolanle Gbeleyi, who made this known in Abeokuta in a chat with our correspondent, said the project was meant to improve power supply to Ogun State from the national grid. The project involves the construction of five 33 KVA sub-stations and the laying of 203 kilometres of new power lines within Ogun State, stretching to Badagry in Lagos State. The sub-stations are to be located at the Mountain of Fire camp at Ibafo, RCCG Redemption Camp in Mowe, Ajegunle near Agbara and Ejio, near Arigbajo. They will also serve the Abeokuta metropolis. Gbeleyi explained that the aspect of the project already completed included the enumeration of households and farmlands that will be demolished to create the right of way for the new power line. He disclosed that money for the compensation of those whose property would give way for the right of way was being prepared and would be submitted to the World Bank for approval. The compensation payment, according to him, would begin immediately after its approval and release of money.
