The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has advised Nigeria to be cautious in returning refugees to their homes in the Northeast. This came as a result of the suicide bomb attack in Mubi on May 1. While noting that preparations for the voluntary repatriation of Nigerian refugees from Cameroon were underway, the UNHCR called on the tripartite committee to carefully assess and consider security conditions to ensure sustainable returns in the affected areas. In a statement by Elizabeth Mpimbaza, the Senior External Relations Officer of UNHCR Nigeria, said the organisation would play its part in the safe return of the refugees.
