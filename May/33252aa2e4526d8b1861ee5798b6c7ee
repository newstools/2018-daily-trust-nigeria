Prominent northern elders under the umbrella of Northern Leaders and Stakeholders Assembly (NLSA) yesterday met with Senate President Bukola Saraki. The meeting discussed issues bordering on the fate of the North ahead of the 2019 general elections. The meeting held at the Senate wing of the National Assembly behind closed doors was attended by Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, Ibrahim Mantu, Dr Bello Haliru, former Niger State governor, Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu and former Kogi State governor, Idris Wada. Others are, former FCT ministers, Bala Mohammed and Abba Gana, former minister of Women Affairs, Hajia Inna Ciroma, Dr Umar Ardo, Hajia Zainab Maina, Dr Mamman Shata and Senator Joseph Waku. Yakasai in a speech made available to newsmen said the assembly was formed to promote unity saying “Although the Assembly is political in nature, it is decidedly non-partisan. The assembly is not a prelude to the formation of a political party. Its doors are wide open to every northerner of all political persuasions without discrimination whatsoever. Let me therefore stress that, though our organization is political, it is non partisan.” He said they have set motion in place to organize Northern political summit to address the loss of confidence on the national political class. Saraki in a statement by his media office urged the northern leaders to join hands with the Federal Government in finding lasting solution to incessant killings in the country. “Being leaders, this is the time to find lasting solutions. This is not the time for blame. This is the time for us to bring peace and regional dialogue. No society worth its salt will keep quiet in the face of these killings,” Saraki said.
