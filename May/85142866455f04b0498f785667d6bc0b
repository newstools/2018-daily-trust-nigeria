Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has warned that employers should desist from treating corps members as cheap labourers. Ikpeazu, who spoke at the closing ceremony of the 2018 Batch A orientation course of the National Youth Service Scheme (NYSC) at the orientation camp in Bende LGA of the state, also said corps members employers should not grant permission to them to travel outside the state without recourse to the NYSC State coordinator. He said, “Corps employers should treat corps members as permanent members of your staff by allowing them enjoy the same facilities provided for your staff, assign them challenging tasks and provide suitable tools to execute assigned duties.” He enjoined the employers to accept the corps members posted to them and assist them to settle down quickly. “While serving and being independent, there is every tendency for you to be adventurous, these include embarking on various journeys to visit friends, relations and well-wishers. I wish to advise you to be cautious, records abound that most deaths recorded during service years occurred through road traffic accidents,” he told the corps members. The state NYSC coordinator, Mrs Francesca Ifon, called on the corps members to continue to put in their best to the service of their fatherland and also urged employers to accept the members posted to them and treat them like their children. She noted that the members displayed high level of discipline during the orientation to the admiration of the NYSC Director-General.
