Bayelsa State Governor Henry Seriake Dickson has said the support of the North is indispensable towards the attainment of a true federal and restructured Nigeria. The governor made the comment while speaking on the need for a restructured Nigeria in Kaduna on Monday, when he visited Governor Nasir El-Rufai. Dickson called on political leaders in the South and the North to pull down the barriers of mistrust and miscommunication against the unity of the country. He said he had fruitful discussions with his host on the future of the country and the imperative of sustained discussions of critical issues across party lines for the common good. The governor said is important for political leaders irrespective of their political parties to work together for the realization of a restructured, stable, united and great country. “I want to make this very clear that the northern part of Nigeria is not just essential to this new vision, the buy in of the north is critical, it is indispensable in bringing about this new Nigeria,” he said. Governor El Rufai said there were some aspects of the Nigerian federalism in need of improvements as contained in the report of the APC Committee on restructuring. El Rufai said the ruling party had set up a technical committee on the implementation of the key recommendations of the committee which he said had been working. The Kaduna governor said he was optimistic that the technical committee would soon present its report to the party so that the recommendations could be sent to the Federal Government.
