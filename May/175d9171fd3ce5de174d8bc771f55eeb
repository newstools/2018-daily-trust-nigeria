The Senate yesterday began consideration of President Muhammadu Buhari’s nominees for the board of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), 13 months after the request was made. President Buhari had in April last year forwarded to the Senate, names of the nominees for the board of the CBN for confirmation in accordance with section 6 (1) (d),  and 10 (1) of the CBN Act, 2007. The consideration was delayed following a resolution of the Senate, halting further confirmation of the President’s nominees, not captured in the Constitution, over a statement by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on the acting chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu. Chairman of the Senate Committee on local and foreign debts, Senator Shehu Sani (APC, Kaduna) had penultimate Wednesday raised alarm that delay in the confirmation of the nominees was hindering the performance of the apex bank. The motion for the consideration of the request was moved at the plenary session yesterday by the Senate Leader, Ahmad Lawan (APC, Yobe) and seconded by the minority leader, Godswill Akpabio (PDP, Akwa Ibom). Lawan listed the names of the Non- Executive Directors to include; Professor Ummu Ahmed Jalingo (North East) Professor Justina Odinakachukwu Nnabuko (South East) Professor Mike I. Obadan (South South), Dr Abdu Abubakar (North West) and Adeola Adetunji (South West). He said the single request of the motion was that the request be referred to a relevant committee of the Senate for further legislative action. Senate President Bukola Saraki referred it to the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and other financial institutions chaired by Senator Rafiu Ibrahim (APC, Kwara). Saraki said the committee should report back to the Senate in two weeks.
