The Secretaries to the State Governments in the All Progressives Congress (APC) controlled states have called on state governors to make the payments of salaries and pensions to workers and pensioners top priority. 

This was part of the resolutions contained in a communique issued on Friday at the end of the the 6th Quarterly Meeting of Secretaries to Governments of All Progressives Congress States held in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital between May 24 and 25.

The communique which was jointly signed by the Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Mr Salihu Lukman and the Secretary to the Kogi State Government, Dr (Mrs) Folashade Ayoade Arike resolved that APC States should be enjoined to carry along relevant MDAs in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in view of the relevance of the SDGs to the successful implementation of APC Manifesto.

The meeting also resolved that given the prevailing  socio-political and economic realities of Nigeria, states should create the enabling environment for achieving the 2030 and 2063 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The meeting recommended that a platform for policy synergy
between the federal and state governments that would facilitate the domestication of federal government's
development policies in states for better implementation to be put in place to foster understanding, knowledge sharing, and consensus-building.

The meeting equally recommends the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) in states in line with the federal government's structure and to also deploy the Bank Verification Number at the state level, where it is not yet adopted.

The meeting agreed to continually share information, ideas and knowledge through its quarterly meetings and the PGF Secretariat to promote synergy across the member States and facilitate greater cooperation for uniform/common policy initiatives geared towards sustainable development.
