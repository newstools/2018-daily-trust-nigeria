Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has appealed to donor agencies for continued support of its development initiatives. The governor said this in Benin yesterday during the first quarterly review of Donor Agencies’ projects in the state. Represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie, the governor said that in the light of Nigeria’s transition from low to middle income status, the country risked losing access to certain funding for development. He said the state government is adopting the State Health Insurance Scheme to ensure  accessible and affordable healthcare for the people. “As donor support is shrinking, we must begin to look at other sources of funds to assist us with our developmental projects. It is on this note that we request our donor partners to keep granting Edo State the understanding it truly deserves because of our unalloyed commitment of ensuring that every of your effort crystalizes into high-yielding gains for all stakeholders.” Earlier, Commissioner for Budget, Maryam Abubakar, said the state government places emphasis on the deepening of development by donor agencies, especially in line with her developmental plan, captured in thematic areas in the State’s Strategic Plan 2010-2020.
