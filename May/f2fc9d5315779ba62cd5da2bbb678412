ABC TV network has cancelled comedian Roseanne Barr’s sitcom after she posted a racist tweet likening an African-American former Obama aide to an ape. ABC said: “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values and we have decided to cancel her show.” Barr’s tweet said Valerie Jarrett was the child of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Planet of the Apes film. The reboot of her hit ‘90s sitcom “Roseanne” has been a ratings hit.
