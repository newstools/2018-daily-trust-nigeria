The Kuje chapter chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Godwin Poyi, has said that the party is not scared of any opposition party ahead of 2019 election. Poyi, who spoke with newsmen in Kuje on Thursday, said  APC’s developmental projects within its  few years in office showed that there won’t be any chance for voting any party outside the ruling party. He insisted that serious minded people and opposition parties have to compare the previous and present administrations of the council before passing judgement. He said if the opposition PDP had failed in 16 years of it’s leadership, there was nothing new the people will expect or get from the party again. The party leader assured the supporters of continued provision of the dividends of democracy to rural dwellers at all times. Meanwhile, the Kuje chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) through the  publicity secretary, Mr. Henry Ugbaja, while reacting, said the APC was full of antics and has no specific project to show since it assumed leadership. He  said if the voters were allowed to decide on their preferred choice of those to lead them come 2019, there won’t be APC in Kuje again.
