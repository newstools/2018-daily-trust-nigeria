The Joint National Association of Persons With Disability has urged  government at all levels to adhere to UN Convention that says five per  cent of jobs in government establishments be reserved for physically  challenged persons. The Chairman of the Edo chapter of the association, Mr Henry Ebose,  made the call in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin  on Friday. He decried the present situation where employment of disabled persons  into government establishments were often based on sympathy. He said “Nigerian government is aware of the UN convention but employs some of us due to pity and not by the convention. “What we are saying is that whatever employment that is available  should not be given to us based on sympathy, we do not want this.” Ebose also called for an enabling law that would help persons with disability, regretting that
the absence of such law made it difficult for the people to access public buildings. He added that “all we want is disability inclusion law that deals with education, employment and infrastructure. “As a person, I knew what I suffered before I could graduate from  Auchi Polytechnic from the hostel down to classroom and the library, I  struggled to have access to these places. “You will find that there are lots of us who seriously desire to  actualise their dreams in education or other areas, but lack the grace  to go through the process. “We really do not want pity but government policies in the direction it ought to be for us to realise our dreams.” (NAN)
