A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja,  has sentenced a 20-year-old man, Ismail Ibrahim, to four months in prison for stealing a cell phone valued at N75,000. Ibrahim, of no fixed address, was arraigned on a two-count charge of joint act and theft which he pleaded guilty to. Delivering judgment, Justice Abubakar Sadiq said the court had no option than to sentence Ibrahim accordingly. Sadiq, however, denied the convict an option of fine “because he was not a first time offender.” He, therefore, sentenced the convict to four months in prison, saying the punishment would serve as deterrent to others. The Prosecutor, Dalhatu Zannah, had earlier told the court that Babangida Sirage of Karu, Abuja, reported the incident at Life Camp Police Station, Abuja, on May 4. Zannah said the convict committed the offences on the same date at about 8:00 p.m. at Jabi, Abuja. (NAN)
