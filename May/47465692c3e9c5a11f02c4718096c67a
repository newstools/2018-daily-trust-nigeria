Seven U.S. states, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia, filed a lawsuit against the administration of President Donald Trump over its failure to remove the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) migration programme. The programme was introduced by the administration of former President Barack Obama. DACA allows undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children, known as “Dreamers,” to stay and work in the U.S. According to The Washington Post media outlet, Texas Attorney Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Brownsville asking whether Obama’s decision to introduce DACA without congressional approval was lawful. Trump, in fact, opposes DACA and his administration announced in September that it would end the programme in spring. However, federal judge John Bates ordered the Trump administration to resume DACA program in 90 days unless it adequately explains the decision to end the immigration programme.
