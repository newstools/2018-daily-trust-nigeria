Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi yesterday asked people of the state to ignore the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and go about their normal businesses. IPOB had declared today sit-at-home to commemorate the struggle for the actualization of Biafra State. Governor Umahi spoke at Pa Ngele Oruta Township stadium, Abakaliki venue of the 2018 democracy day celebration. He called on the federal government to address the issue of marginalisation of the South East region. “Any person that closes shop will forfeit his or her shop forever; any person caught will be decisively dealt with, I ask Ebonyians to go about their normal business. “We are making efforts to stand on our feet and we are on course and we don’t need distraction, second colonisation we want to continue and no man born of woman has the capacity to set us backward,” he said. Umahi maintained that south east governors of proscribed IPOB activities because of its activities which were unconstitutional but added that forum welcomed the resolutions reached recently by Ohaneze in addressing the plight of Igbo people. “The right way is what the Ohaneze did in the committee of Igbo people and that is what we believe, so we call on the federal government to look into the plight of the south east and address the issue of marginalisation,” he said.
