The National Commandant of Peace Corps of Nigeria (PCN) Dickson Akoh said all hope is not lost in passage of the corps’ bill by the National Assembly. Akoh while briefing the press in Abuja yesterday over the recent rejection of the bill by members of the House of Representatives said the peace corps bill was not dead as widely publicized, but still alive and on course. “Be rest assured that the PCN remains on course and focused in our commitment to nation-building and services to the society. The never-say-die spirit of the corps shall overcome this temporary setback, as we are diligently consulting and engaging necessary stakeholders to resolve this politically motivated challenge facing the organization. “The bill still stands validly passed and may still be assent to by any president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, at any point in time, including our incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari.” Akoh said the Rep`s  rejection of the bill was a denial of Nigerian youth to have a place in the nation, saying those who spoke against overriding the President only succeeded in trading the youth friendly bill on the altar of securing election tickets.
