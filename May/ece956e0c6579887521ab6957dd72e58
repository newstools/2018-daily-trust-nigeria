The Nigeria Police Force has said the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria permits the Inspector General of Police to send a representative when invited by the Senate.

The Police said this while responding to the Senate's 'Vote of no confidence' declaration on the IGP of Police Ibrahim Idris on Wednesday.

In a tweet on the Nigeria Police Force's verified twitter handle "@PoliceNG", the body said: "The NPF wishes [to] inform the General Public that the reasons for which the Senate has summoned the IGP is official & not personal, & the 1999 constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended & the Police Act & Regulations allowed the IGP to delegate DIG or AIG to represent him."  The Senate had passed a resolution declaring the IGP as ‘enemy of democracy’ and unfit to hold public office in Nigeria and abroad.

The resolution was passed after a 50-minute closed session on the refusal of the police boss to appear before the Senate over the arrest of Senator Dino Melaye (APC, Kogi) and killings in some parts of the country.

The Senate had summoned the IGP on three occasions, but he snubbed the lawmakers only to send a representative in two occasions. 

Wednesday was the third time fixed for the IG’s appearance but he stayed away.
