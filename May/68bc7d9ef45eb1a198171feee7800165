The Deputy Speaker of the Ondo State House of Assembly, Ogundeji Iroju, has been impeached for allegedly working at crossroad with Speaker Bamidele Oleyelogun. He was immediately replaced by Abimbola Fajolu, representing Ile-Oluji/Okeigbo constituency. In an impeachment notice signed by 18 of the 26 lawmakers, they alleged that the deputy speaker was working at variance with the speaker. Moving the motion for impeachment yesterday, the lawmaker representing Akoko North East Constituency, Fatai Olotu, said such frosty relationship was not in the interest of members. According to Olotu, “the office of the Speaker is an exalted one that must be respected.” The lawmaker representing Akure South 2, Olajide Sunday, seconded the motion. The Speaker called for a voice vote and members unanimously called for the impeachment of Iroju.
