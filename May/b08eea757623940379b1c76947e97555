A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in the FCT has called on the party supporters in the territory to call for a stakeholders’ meeting to avoid further division. Alhaji Abubakar Sidi, former FCT campaign coordinator for Goodluck/Sambo 2015, who addressed journalists in Abuja, said the PDP has the brightest chance to take over the leadership of Nigeria. The killings in Nigeria, the level of poverty, ethno-religious divisions are what will give PDP an edge in 2019, he said. He said it was now time to right the wrong done in 2015, adding that the present leadership had started making efforts to correct the wrongs the party did in the past. Sidi said APC was not ready to appease the common man who made it what it is, insisting that people at the grassroots were not benefitting from the APC government. “In terms of achievement, I believe history will judge everybody. Among all the promises they made which one have they fulfilled? They have been able to stop the bombing by about 30% but not the killing which has doubled,” he said.
