Osun State Governor, Mr Rauf Aregbesola has said that 8.1 trillion Naira revenue was not remitted into the coffers of the federal government when Dr Goodluck Johnathan was the President.

Aregbesola said this in Osogbo, Osun State at a colloquium organised to mark his 61st birthday tagged 'Raufnomics in the transformation of Osun'.

The Governor said when he calculated it, he realised that the share of Osun from the 8.1trillion Naira would have been 75 billion Naira and that if that money was given to him, he would not have owed workers salaries and that he would have been able to pay large part of Osun debts.

"My administration was very prudent and transparent. I have just six months to leave the office. By 2019 and 2020, the state will liquidate its major debts."

"It will not be difficult for my successor to cope with the remaining debts which is federal government bond. I know my successor will surpass my performance and it will be easy for him because of the foundation that we put in place.
