The Controller-General of Federal Fire Service (FFS) Joseph Anebi has warned that states that are yet to implement the National Fire Safety Code may be compelled to do so. Anebi who stated this at a press briefing in Abuja on Friday to mark the 2018 International Fire Fighters Day, hinted that the Fire Service Act may be amended to compel the state governments to implement the fire code. While urging states to implement the Code to strengthen the fire services at the grassroots level, he revealed that the nation had lost over N5 trillion to fire in the last five years, excluding human lives. Anebi, who was represented by the Assistant Comptroller-General, Policy, Regulation and Inspection, Quintus Azogu, disclosed that only few states were implementing the fire code which he said would enhance public safety. He said, “many states are not implementing the fire safety code; Over N5trn has been lost to fire in the last five years, excluding human lives which cannot be estimated. We may need to amend the Fire Service Act to compel states to implement the Fire Safety Code.” Anebi revealed that the Federal Fire Service had lost six personnel in the past five years, adding that their insurance and terminal benefits had been paid to their family members.
