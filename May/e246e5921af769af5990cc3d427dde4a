Successful applicants undergoing screening exercise for the Nigeria Police Force have been warned against giving bribes to anybody in order to facilitate their screening. The Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of Finance and Administration, Shuaibu Lawal Gambo, handed the warning while addressing the successful applicants from the six area councils who were undergoing screening at the FCT command headquarters in Abuja yesterday. He said the ongoing screening exercise across the country was going to be transparent, saying applicants who are qualified would surely scale through. He said candidates who had the educational requirements and passed the physical and medical screenings did not need bother about offering bribes to get recruited. The DIG said the Nigeria police had so many checks and balances in ensuring that only those who were qualified were recruited into the force. “In the past, we have had so many complaints of corrupt practices, but this time around, we have put measures in place and that is why we make the screening transparent. And on this note, we are calling you the applicants not to give one dime to anybody because it will not help you,” he said.
