The BBC Hausa short story writing competition is now open for entries from all women writing in Hausa, irrespective of their nationality or experience. Entries must be engaging works of fiction on any topic and should be between 1000 to 1500 words. A panel of judges will select one winner and two runners-up. Jimeh Saleh, Editor of the BBC Hausa Service, said: “Since launching it two years ago, the competition has provided a platform for budding and established women writers to showcase their creativity and share their stories. We had over 400 entries last year and the stories had unique and fascinating perspectives on the daily challenges women face especially in Hausa communities.” Last year’s edition of the annual contest was won by Maimuna Sani Beli. The panel of judges termed her idea about exploration of life after death as bold and creative. The first edition was won by “Sansanin ’Yan Gudun Hijira”, a story narrating the plight of the victims of the Boko Haram crisis. Entries are to be submitted to labari.bbchausa@bbc.co.uk by midnight July 8 2018.
