A woman had a cockroach stuck in her ear for more than a week after the insect crawled in while she slept. Katie Holley, 29, from Florida, woke startled to find what felt like a piece of ice lodged in her left ear, only to discover two bug legs sticking out. After her husband was only able to remove a few legs with tweezers, Ms Holley rushed to A&E while the cockroach continue to wriggle deeper in her ear canal. Doctors thought they had removed the roach until, nine days later, Ms Holley continued to experience pain and a loss of hearing in her ear, leading to a local medic removing six more piece of the insect’s carcass. Later that day, an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist managed to remove the cockroach’s entire head, upper torso, remaining limbs and antennae. Ms Holley said: ‘He told me that he extracted bugs from peoples’ ears at least once a month - and I was the second person that day who needed it.’ Cockroaches are thought to crawl into people’s ears in search of food.
