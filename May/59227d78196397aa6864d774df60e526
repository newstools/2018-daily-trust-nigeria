The Benue State government has disclosed intention to close all Internally Displaced Peoples’ Camp (IDPs) in the state soon. Daily Trust reports that eight camps were officially designated by the state government for the rural people who fled their homes on New Year’s Day after attacks on their communities by armed bandits in two areas of Logo and Guma local councils. Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Emmanuel Shior, made the disclosure on Wednesday while commending the gestures of the President of the Yoruba community in Benue State, Chief Isaac Akinkumi, who donated food items to IDPs at the Abagana camp situated outskirt of Makurdi. He said the agency had informed the state governor, Samuel Ortom, on the need to close down two camps due to its vulnerability to attacks by bandits. Shior said, “Recently, we noticed that the militia herdsmen have been attacking two IDP camps at Terkimbe and Agbeda, this made us to report to the state governor on the need to officially close down the camps. We expect that the affected displaced persons move into town and put up with their relatives.” He commended Akinkumi, owner of the Tito Group of Companies, for coming to the aid of the IDPs at a time the state government was facing serious humanitarian challenges. He also disclosed that as at March 31, 2018, the number of IDPs in the state stood at 170,000.
