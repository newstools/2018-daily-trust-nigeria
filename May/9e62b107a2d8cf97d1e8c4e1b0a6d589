Two middle aged women have been arrested with two new born babies at an army checkpoint in Abaji, FCT,  Abuja. A witness, who hawked soft drinks at the checkpoint said the two women were arrested when officials of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on patrol flagged down the vehicle in which they were travelling. He said the NDLEA officials were suspicious of the women and when they were interrogated, they could not give satisfactory explanation to the officials. “The two women were jittery when they were interrogated and the NDLEA officials suspected they must have stolen the babies.  So they were handed over to the police,” he said. A police source who preferred anonymity confided in our reporter that the two women later confessed to stealing the two babies from a hospital in Abia State to deliver them to someone in Zuba,  Abuja. “Actually, the women confessed that they were taking the babies to someone in Zuba and  they promised them N30,000 each after successful delivery of the  two babies. But the two suspects have been arrested in connection to the crime, while the babies have been handed over to social welfare department of Abaji area council,” he said. The police source said making the arrest public on the media may jeopardize the ongoing investigation. Our reporter learnt that the social welfare department of the council has taken the babies to a motherless babies’ home in Abuja. When contacted, the Abaji Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Tersoo Tile, said he was not aware of the incident.
