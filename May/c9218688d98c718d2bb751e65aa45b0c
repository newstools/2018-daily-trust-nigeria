Vladimir Putin has been inaugurated as the president of Russia for the fourth time, renewing another six-year term in office. The 65-year-old Russian leader took oath at an official ceremony in the Grand Kremlin Palace in the capital, Moscow, on Monday, 18 years after he first came to power. Putin’s fourth presidential term comes after he easily won the elections in March, receiving 76 percent of the votes. “I consider it my duty and sense of my life to do everything for Russia for its present and future - for the peaceful and prosperous future - and the welfare of every Russian family,” Putin said in a speech at the ceremony.
