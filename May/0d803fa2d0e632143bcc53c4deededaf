The global “Nestlé for Healthier Kids” initiative was over the weekend launched in Abuja. The initiative targets 17,000 children and 350 teachers in primary schools in Abaji, FCT and Ogun State in 2018. Training and coaching under the programme will be implemented in collaboration with the Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB) in the selected schools. Speaking at the launch, Mr Mauricio Alarcon, MD/CEO, Nestlé Nigeria represented by the Manager, Corporate Communications and Public Affairs, Ms Victoria N’dee Uwadoka, said,“Since its foundation, Nestlé has been committed to helping parents and caregivers provide the right nutrition to their children.” The MD/CEO said the company would leverage on its industry-leading innovation capability to enhance food and beverages for children with more fruits, vegetables, fiber-rich grains and micronutrients. He stated that Nestlé will help children lead healthier lives through four main avenues: promoting healthy lifestyles in schools, fostering physical activity, educating parents on nutrition as well as improving the nutrient profile of its foods and beverages by fortifying them in vitamins and minerals while reducing sugar, fat and salt. The launch in Abuja was attended by children from participating schools in the FCT, representatives from the ministries of health and education, the Nutrition Society of Nigeria, Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB), FCT and Ogun State Universal Education Boards. The programme, which is aimed at helping 50 million children globally to lead healthier lives by 2030, will focus on healthy nutrition, hydration and hygiene of children across the two states.
