World Cup-winning goalscorer Mario Gotze has been left out of Germany’s squad for June’s tournament in Russia. The Borussia Dortmund striker scored in extra time against Argentina in 2014 to seal Germany’s fourth World Cup. Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer has been named in the provisional squad, despite being out of action since breaking his foot in September. It has also been announced that manager Joachim Low has extended his contract until 2022. Manchester City’s Leroy Sane and Ilkay Gundogan are among the Premier League players to be selected. They are joined by Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger and Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil. Ozil and Gundogan have been criticised by the German Football Federation (DFB) for posing in photos with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Germany are in Group F with Mexico, Sweden and South Korea, and play their first match on Sunday, 17 June. Four players will be cut from the squad before the finals begin.
