The European Union (EU) on Friday notified the World Trade Organisation (WTO) a list of U.S. products on which the bloc may in the future apply extra import duties in retaliation against U.S. tariff measures on steel and aluminum. “This would be to compensate in an equivalent manner for the impact of the U.S. tariff measures on steel and aluminum, which the EU considers to be safeguard measures in effect, should they enter into force. “This notification does not result in any immediate imposition of additional duties on imports from the United States. “Should the EU decide to go ahead with the additional import duties, this step would be taken in full compliance with the rules under the WTO Safeguard Agreement,’’ the bloc added. Amid widespread dissent from business groups and trading partners around the world, the U.S. announced on March 8 a tariff increase on imports of certain steel and aluminum products from, inter alia, the EU, at the rates of 25 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, applicable as from March 23. Temporary exemption was later given by the U.S. to the EU and then extended until June 1 in order to give time for both sides to reach agreements over trade negotiations. The EU insisted that it should be fully and permanently exempted from these U.S. measures, saying they cannot be justified on the grounds of what the U.S. calls “national security’’. (Xinhua/NAN)
