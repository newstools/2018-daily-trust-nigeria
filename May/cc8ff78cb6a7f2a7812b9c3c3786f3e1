It is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s “fixed will” that a summit with US President Donald Trump in Singapore should go ahead, state media say. This followed a surprise meeting on Saturday between Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Mr Trump had cancelled the 12 June summit citing North Korea’s “hostility” - but on Saturday he said things were “moving along very nicely”. Meanwhile US officials are reported to have travelled to the North on Sunday. The American team, led by Sung Kim, a former ambassador to South Korea, was due to hold talks with North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui on preparations for the summit, US and South Korean media say.
