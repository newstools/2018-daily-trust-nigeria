The police have arraigned a 61-year-old businesswoman, Agnes Ezumene, in a Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, for allegedly causing hurt and criminal intimidation. Ezumene, a resident of Ereke Karmo, Abuja, is standing trial on charges bordering on causing hurt and criminal intimidation, offences she denied committing. Earlier, the prosecutor, Mr Dalhatu Zannah, had told the court that one Ubah Ansalem of Ereke Junction, opposite Papa Hotel, reported the incident at the Karmo Police Station on April 22. Zannah said on the same date at about 10p.m., the defendant and three others now at large, attacked the complainant. “The defendant and her accomplices, beat up the complainant for no reason, and in the process the defendant used axe and inflicted injury on the complainant’s face,’’ Zannah said. The prosecutor alleged that it took the intervention of people around to rescue the complainant. He told the court that in the process, the defendant was arrested and her accomplices ran away. Zannah said the complainant was rushed to hospital and he spent N 8,000 for treatment. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 79, 246 and 397 of the Penal Code. The judge, Mr Abubakar Sadiq, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N20,000, with a surety in like sum and adjourned the case until May 15 for hearing. (NAN)
