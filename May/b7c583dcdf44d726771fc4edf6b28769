A group under the auspices of Movement for Peace and Patriotism in Nigeria (MPAN) has solicited for the support and cooperation of the media in peace building in the country. The president of the group, Comrade Umar Magaji Danladi, who spoke with our reporter in Abuja yesterday, said the call to seek media support to propagate the message of peace across the country became necessary at a time there were crises in parts of the country. He said the group, which was established in January this year, embarked on public awareness and sensitization campaign across the country, especially in Abuja and parts of Niger State, on the need for citizens to always preach and maintain peace irrespective of ethnic, religious and political affiliations.
