The Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Friday commissioned a Dialysis Centre and an emergency ramp at the recently established NAF Reference Hospital in Port Harcourt to further enhance healthcare delivery for Nigerians.   The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, also commissioned a well-furnished 6 x 2-room officers’ accommodation, as part of concerted efforts to address the accommodation needs of NAF personnel in general, and those serving at 115 Special Operations Group Port Harcourt in particular.  The new residential block was named after Wing Commander MB Umar, a NAF combat helicopter pilot, for his sterling and outstanding act of gallantry in the face of adversaries in the Northeast counterinsurgency operations.  In his remarks, Air Marshal Abubakar expressed delight at the timely completion of the projects, which are in line with the policy trust of the current NAF leadership to reposition the NAF by promoting and inculcating excellence and service delivery.  He added that the NAF was not oblivious of the fact that the human needs of a fighting force are very critical to operational effectiveness.  “This is why this administration places a lot of premium on the welfare needs of personnel and that is why we have continued to take far reaching initiatives designed to enhance the capacity of our key strategic resource, which is the human capital”, the CAS added.  The CAS expressed hope that the new project would provide some form of leverage for personnel of the Unit and further enhance their efficiency during the conduct of their military duties.  Air Marshal Abubakar further stated that the newly commissioned facilities at the NAF Reference Hospital Port Harcourt were designed to address the secondary and tertiary healthcare needs of personnel as well as the host community.
