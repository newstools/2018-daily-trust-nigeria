The Ansar-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria (ADS) has urged Muslims to accord due importance to payment of Zakat which is one of the pillars of Islam. Chairman of the society’s Northern States Council of Missioners, Sheik Muhydeen Ajani Bello gave the charge yesterday in Abuja at its 24th annual Ramadan Lecture and special prayer for the nation themed, “Corporate Social Responsibility: Antidote to Insecurity and Poverty in Nigeria -Islamic Perspective”. Bello said “Islam considers Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) very important by making it a compulsory pillar of Islam, using Zakat to leverage the suffering of the poor to reduce the occurrence of insecurity among the citizenry. “In Nigeria today, once you have N895, 285.00 for the past one year, you are expected to pay two and half percent (N22,382.125) as your Zakat for the year.” The Chairman Abuja branch of the organisation, Alhaji Abdur-Rasheed Oyetunji, said the theme was chosen to sensitize corporate citizen on their responsibility to the community, where they do business to collaborate with the government towards ameliorating poverty. “Poverty has been found to be trigger to insecurity, this could not have come other than now considering the present insecurity, poverty and austerity situation in the nation,” Oyetunji said.
