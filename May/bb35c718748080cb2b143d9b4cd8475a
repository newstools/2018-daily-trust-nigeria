The FCT Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Alhaji Yahaya Bello, has said the electorate have demonstrated enthusiasm towards the 2019 general elections. The REC, who spoke while on a courtesy call to the FCT minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, in Abuja recently, said  new persons, especially those who had just attained the voting age of 18 as well as people coming on transfer have been coming forward to register. Bello, however lamented that the commission still had many uncollected PVCs, a backlog of over 246,000 arising from the 2011, 2014 and 2016 exercises and called on the residents to come forward and collect their cards to be able to perform their civic obligations. The REC appealed for collaboration with the FCTA, especially towards mobilising the citizenry to use the opportunity of the ongoing Continuous Voters Registration Exercise to register for the elections. The FCT minister, who was represented  by  the FCTA Permanent Secretary, Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, expressed his administration’s readiness to partner with the electoral umpire to sensitize residents to come forward to collect their PVCs. “We are going to work with all the stakeholders: the area councils, traditional rulers as well as faith-based and community organizations to ensure that people take advantage of the ongoing exercise to register, and be able to vote in the forthcoming elections,” he said.
