A man has shot dead two female police officers and a civilian in the eastern Belgian city of Liège. The gunman also took a female cleaner hostage at a school before being killed by police. Four other police officers were also injured. The man’s motive is not yet clear but the incident is being treated as terrorism. Police sources quoted in local media said the man was heard shouting “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest” in Arabic). Belgian broadcaster RTBF said the gunman was let out from prison on temporary release on Monday where he had been serving time on drug offences. It said that he may have been radicalised while in jail. Liège mayor Willy Demeyer confirmed the deaths of the two female officers during a press conference and said that “physical and psychological support” would be provided to the families of the victims. Mr Demeyer said it was an assault on the state of Belgium, adding: “Police were definitely the target of this attack. “We will forever be at the side of the police officers.”
