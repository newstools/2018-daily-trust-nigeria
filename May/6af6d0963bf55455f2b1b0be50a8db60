Angry villagers have set fire to police headquarters after a five-year-old girl with albinism was abducted and killed by armed men in Mali. Djeneba Diarra, who lived in a village in Fana, 125km (78 miles) north of the capital Bamako, was taken from the courtyard where she was sleeping with her mother and sister in the early hours of Sunday morning. The little girl’s headless body was later found beside the mosque. “We demand justice. Her head was taken. This is a ritual crime,” activist Mamadou Sissoko told news agency AFP after going to the scene.
