Six people were killed in an attack by Boko Haram jihadists on a Chadian army checkpoint on an island in Lake Chad, a military source told AFP Sunday.

Accoding to AFP, the people killed included four government officials and a soldier.

The overnight killings, which cost the life of a civilian along with two customs officials, two forestry agents and a soldier occurred when “Boko Haram elements attacked an advanced post of the Chad army” in Gabalami in the country’s far west, the source said.
