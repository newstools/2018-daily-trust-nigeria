The kidnapers of the district head of Gulida,  Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Umar Awoje,  are demanding for N10 million ransom before they release him. City News had reported that Awoje was in the early hours of Sunday, kidnapped by 10 armed man who invaded the community. A family source who was privy to the ongoing negotiations with the kidnappers confided in our reporter yesterday that they first demanded for N20 million but later brought it down to N10 million. He said the negotiators had been pleading with the kidnappers to accept N300,000 but they insisted on collecting N10 million before the victim would be set free. He said the victim’s family members were still devastated since the abduction, adding that they had no means of raising N10 million that the kidnapers were demanding from them. “In fact, as I speak to you now, it was even the yam the victim stored in his barn that the family members conveyed to the market to sell and raise N300,000 which they are pleading with them to accept but, they are insisting that they will only accept N10 million instead of the N20 million they requested earlier,” he said. When contacted, the spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manza, said he was not aware of any negotiations, and that he will  make enquiry and get back to our reporter.
