The National Chairman of National Unity Party (NUP), Chief Perry Opara, says a former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, appears more favoured to win the 2019 presidential election if he decides to run on the platform of his party. Opara, who spoke at the weekend in Abuja, said defeating President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019 could be a difficult task but added that it would require the personality and clout of someone like Kwankwaso to accomplish. The NUP chairman, who said Kwankwaso could be trusted with power, voiced his conviction that the former governor would make a difference if he made the right decision in choosing the party to run on and picking the right vice presidential candidate. “Buhari has a cult-like followership in the far North while Senator Kwankwaso has the strongest political movement that cuts across the nation. If Kwankwaso decides to run for the presidency in 2019 on the NUP platform, and if he decides to take his vice presidential candidate from the South, particularly a devout Christian, humble, popular and young, he will win the 2019 presidential election. “Senator Kwankwaso talks less, has a calm disposition, is less controversial and he does more work than he talks. He respects the young and the aged and flows freely with both genders,” he also said. Opara, who said anyone who dismissed President Buhari in 2019 would be too naïve, stated that “Buhari is more popular than APC.” Some key officials of Kwankwaso’s group, known as Kwankwasiyya Movement, had attended the NUP’s National Harmonisation and Integration’ meeting held in Abuja last Wednesday.
