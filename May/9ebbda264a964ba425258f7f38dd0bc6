Protests erupted in southern Kashmir after the killing of five civilians and five rebels - including a top commander - in a gun battle with Indian security forces. State Police Chief Shesh Paul Vaid told Al Jazeera security forces confronted rebels in a house on Sunday in Zanipora Badigam village in Shopian district, 60km from the main city of Srinagar, after receiving intelligence about their presence. “The gunfight is over and all the five terrorists have been killed. We made repeated appeals to them to surrender, but they did not,” Vaid said.
