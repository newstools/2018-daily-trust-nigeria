The #BringBackOurGirls (BBOG) convener, Oby Ezekwesili has called on Nigerians to vote wisely in the 2019 general elections.

In a tweet on her official twitter handle @obyezeks, she demanded that electorates must ask candidates to explain how they will turn the country's economy around before voting them to power in 2019.

"Citizens should tell Presidential and Governorship Candidates for 2019 elections to give us their VISIONARY Presentation on : 'How I Will Build a New Nigeria Beyond Oil'. 

"All these Shareers of Oil Revenues should definitely get #RedCards and marched off the Governance field!"

Ezekwesili, a former Federal Minister of Solid Minerals and then as Federal Minister of Education during the second-term presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo, has always been an advocate of transparency and development.
