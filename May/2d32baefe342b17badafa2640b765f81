The All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Saturday conducted an elective state congress through voice votes, with party stalwarts adjudging the exercise as peaceful and successful. The congress which held at the old Parade Ground, Area 10, Garki, Abuja, was superintended over by the House of Representatives member for  AMAC/Bwari constituency, Zephaniah Jisalo. Though the Yoruba community opposed the adoption of Alhaji Nasiru Oludemi, for the position of financial secretary of the ruling party, the exercise went on smoothly. Our correspondents learnt that officials returned unopposed during the congress included; Abdulmalik Usman as Chairman,  Musa Ibrahim Jatu as Deputy Chairman, Hashimu Yakubu Shuaibu as Secretary and Felix Udozie as Vice Chairman 1. Others were  Patrick Ogunyimi as Vice Chairman 11, Shuaibu Sabo Suleiman as Vice Chairman 111, Mohammed Adamu as Assistant Secretary, Prince Umar Bayero as Treasurer, Nasiru Oludemi as Financial Secretary,  Hail-Mary Aipoh as Women Leader, Emmanuel Sheneni as Youth Leader and Adaji Usman as party Organising Secretary. Speaking to our correspondents at the end of the congress, the party’s Organising Secretary, Adaji Usman, commended loyal party members for achieving the feat, while describing the FCT APC congress as one of the most peaceful throughout the country. “This is one of the most peaceful congresses organised by the party. It can’t be better anywhere than what we have all witnessed in the Federal Capital Territory. I challenge other political parties including the PDP to emulate what we have done today,” he said. While reacting to the dissent by the Yoruba community, Usman stressed that “you cannot get it 100 percent in a gathering of divergent opinions, but the most important thing is that the congress was successful.”
