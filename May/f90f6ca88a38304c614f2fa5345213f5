The House of Representatives has urged relevant authorities to ensure the restoration of electricity in Daura and its environs as a result of the sudden collapse of 138KV transmission tower. The relevant authorities are the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the Kano Distribution Company (KEDCO).

The House said the transmission tower, located at Yamadaw village, along Daura Katsina road, had collapsed 10 days ago and plunged the entire area into total darkness, putting the people under unmitigated hardship.

The resolution was sequel to the adoption of a motion by Nasiru Sani Zangon Daura (APC, Katsina).

The House Committee on Power was mandated to liaise with the authorities with a view to ensuring restoration of power to Daura and its neighbouring towns.

In his motion, Zangon Daura said the TCN installed the 138KV transmission tower in the area only last year but that it went down 10 days ago due to windstorm that occurred in the area.

"The said damage has paralyzed social and economic activities in Daura and its environs, making the ongoing Ramadam fasting very burdensome to the people of Daura.

"The blackout is making life difficult for the people in this fasting period and has invariably led to the high cost of living in Daura and its environs with the increased use of generators, and a piece of ice block costing between N100 and N200 where available," he said.

The lawmaker added that unless the situation is contained through the restoration of power supply to the area, "unintended catastrophic consequence is likely to occur."

The motion was unanimously adopted when Speaker Yakubu Dogara put it to voice vote.
