Hundreds of millions of naira were allegedly spent by APC gubernatorial aspirants in the just concluded ward congresses in Taraba State. Daily Trust findings revealed that the congresses were conducted on cash and carry basis as aspirants seeking political offices under the party spent millions of naira to get assurances from delegates ahead of the gubernatorial primaries. Aspirants for the state and national assemblies equally tried to have firm grip of delegates. Daily Trust was told that gubernatorial aspirants rolled out millions of naira for agents in the 16 local government areas of the state to ensure total control of the ward delegates. Immediately after the congresses, however, disagreement ensued between the Integrity Group and another group loyal to the Minister of Women Affairs, Hajiya Jummai Alhassan. The two groups had a field day during the congresses with each trying to have the support of the delegates. The senator representing Taraba Central, Alhaji Yusuf A. Yusuf, told our reporter that he was satisfied with the conduct and outcome of the congresses, saying he was not aware of any protest. Both the women affairs minister and a former acting governor of Taraba State, Sani Abubakar Danladi, who were said to have played roles during the ward congresses, refused to answer calls or reply text messages sent to them by our reporter. However, the APC publicity officer in the state, Mr Yaro Umma, said some aspirants only gave money to facilitate the conduct of the congresses because the national secretariat of the party did not send anything. He also dismissed the claim that delegates were compromised.
