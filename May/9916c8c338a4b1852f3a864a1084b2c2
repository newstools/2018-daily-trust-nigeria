President Muhammadu Buhari has requested the Senate to confirm seven nominees for the governing board of the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC). Senate President Bukola Saraki read two separate letters of the President during yesterday plenary session. The nominees for the NDIC board included Festus Keyamo, who was recently named as the spokesperson of the Buhari re-election campaign committee. NDIC board, according to the letter is to be chaired by Chief Olabode Akeem Mustapha from Ogun State. Other members of the NDIC board are Alhaji Garba Buba (Bauchi) Bello Garba (Sokoto) Josef Okoloagu (Enugu) Mustapha Mudashir (Kwara) and Adewale Adeleke (Ondo). The President also requested confirmation of Attahiru Garba Madami as Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of INEC in accordance with the provision of section 154(1) of the 1999 constitution. Buhari recalled that the Senate had earlier rejected the initial nominee for INEC, on the ground that he hails from the same local government area with a serving national commissioner of INEC.
