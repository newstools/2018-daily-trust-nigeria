The Nigerian Army on Wednesday paraded one armed militant, Idi Gemu, with weapons at Adagu village in Guma Local Government Area of Benue State. Commanding Officer of 72 Battalion, Lt. Col. Suleiman Muhammad, said that troops of 707 Special Forces Brigade in Makurdi apprehended the suspect on Sunday in the crisis-ridden Guma axis of the state. Muhammed said that it was in the course of the soldiersâ€™ intensified operation in the area that the suspect was nabbed while his cohorts escaped during the gun duel which ensued between them and the Army troop. "From investigation, the arrest of this suspect (Gemu) is pointing to the same source of the other three suspects who were earlier paraded at the weekend," he said. Items recovered from the suspect included; an AK47 rifle and live ammunitions. But, the suspect while answering questions from newsmen alleged that he strayed into Torkula village in Guma in search of seven missing sheep and that by the time he found the animals among his Fulani kinsmen herders, it was already night so he couldn't return to his Adadu community in Nasarawa state. Gemu added that he decided to sleep over in company of his kinsmen in Torkula but soldiers besieged the place and arrested him with weapons which belonged to his fleeing relative who handed the destructive items to him.
