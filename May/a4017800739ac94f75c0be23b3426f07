The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has scored the current administration high on security and in the fight against corruption. The forum described the challenges and successes that Nigeria experienced in the last three years as natural process of nation building. ACF in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Muhammad Ibrahim Biu, said the continued degradation of the Boko Haram insurgency, the rescue of over 100 Chibok girls and the 104 Dapchi girls that were kidnapped and held in captivity and the re-habilitation of Internally Displaced Persons have been reassuring measures to restore normalcy and hope. “The various military and other security operations in tackling insecurity nationwide, particularly the farmers/herders clashes and bandits attacks in the states of Benue, Nasarawa, Adamawa, Zamfara, Kaduna, Plateau, Taraba and others are practical demonstration by the government of its resolve to overcome these menace,” the forum stated. ACF said the agencies responsible for the anti-corruption fight, have lived up to their responsibilities with the arrest and prosecution of suspected public treasury looters.
