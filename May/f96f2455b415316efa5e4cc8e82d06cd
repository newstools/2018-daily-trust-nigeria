Gunmen, suspected to be kidnappers, have abducted and released a former FCT senator, Chief Daniel Nyako, near Abaji, on the Abuja- Lokoja road. A relative of the former senator, simply identified as Gabriel, said the incident happened on Saturday afternoon around 2:23pm on his farm located near Chikara, along the highway. He said the former senator left the house in Abaji, drove in his Toyota Tundra truck to the farm, and was supervising it when five gunmen came and whisked him away. According to him, the gunmen beat the former senator up and later released him after they discovered that he was old and too weak to move him to their hideout. “It was God’s intervention because as they were taking him to their hideout, they discovered that he could no longer walk. They beat him up and later released him,” he said. City News learnt that the former senator, who is 80 years old, sometimes drove himself from Abaji to his farm on Abuja-Lokoja road, to relax and supervise labourers working on the farm. When contacted, the spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, said he was not aware of the incident, adding that the area was under Kogi State and not FCT. “The very farm you are talking about is in Kogi State not FCT. I will still contact Abaji DPO to hear from him about the incident,” he said.
