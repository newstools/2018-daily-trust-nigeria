Serena Williams can win the French Open even though she “came back too early” after giving birth, says her coach Patrick Mouratoglou. The 23-time Grand Slam champion has not played a match on clay since reaching the final at Roland Garros in 2016. Williams, 36, withdrew from tournaments in Madrid and Rome this month, casting doubt over her participation at the French Open, which begins on 27 May. “Serena can achieve anything,” Mouratoglou told the WTA website.
