Suspected thugs have allegedly attacked Jibrin Musa Sarki, an aide to the chairman of Kuje Area Council over disagreement at the central ward of the council during the ward congress on Saturday. A witness, who identified himself as Yahaya said the incident happened at about 7p.m. when the suspected thugs who were about 15 in number attacked the supervisory councillor on special duties to the chairman with sticks and machetes. Chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima also confirmed the incident. He said trouble started when the victim, who was a member of the APC ward congress committee had some disagreement over alleged inclusion of some strange names of Kuje central ward executives. He said the victim was at the Kuje police division headquarters, venue of the collation of the ward congress to lodge a complaint over alleged insertion of some names when the thugs attacked him. “Actually, the collation was supposed to be at the party office, but because of the incident that happened last Thursday, they decided to shift  it to the police station. But to our dismay, the same thugs who attacked the chairman came again and beat up Sarki in the presence of the police,” he said. He said the victim only complained that strange names were included in the list of Kuje central ward executives, instead of affirmation as done in other wards. When contacted, the Kuje Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP Aminu Mohammed, said he was not aware of such incident. “I was at the station throughout and I am not aware of this very incident you are talking about,” he said.
