The Director General of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) Aliyu Aziz said the commission targets registration of   50 million Nigerians by end of 2018. Aziz made the disclosure during a joint press conference with the National Orientation Agency (NOA) on the benefits of the National Identification number (NIN) in a digitalized society. He said the commission had been growing the database and ensuring that all citizens have a national identity number. He noted that the commission has enrolled about 30.2 million citizens so far “And our target is to enrol 50 million by the end of 2018. That is why we have decided to collaborate with NOA in sensitizing citizens directly or indirectly especially in the rural areas on its importance especially in a technological society like ours”. The Director General of NOA, Dr Garba Abari said “One of the challenges we have encountered over the years in terms of database is its multiple sources because the Nigerian Immigration generates data base, same with the FRSC and NIMC, but once we have a harmonized data base, we have no doubt that sensitizing and having Nigerians get their NIN will not be a problem.”
