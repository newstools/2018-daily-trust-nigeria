The Kano State Pilgrims Welfare Board has announced N1, 474,167.25 as this year’s hajj fare, just as the board has called on the intending pilgrims that have not complete their payment to do so before the closing date. Briefing newsmen shortly after a meeting with members of the board, the Executive Secretary of the board, Alhaji Muhammad Abba Dambatta, said the hajj fare witnessed a reduction of N63, 972.72 this year. Dambatta explained that this was the first time in almost 10 years where intending pilgrims would pay less than what they paid in the previous year. He also called on all intending pilgrims who already paid their fares in excess of the stated amount to come for the collection of their balance. The executive secretary confirmed that the board had concluded arrangements with regard to the provision of accommodation in the holy land for this year’s hajj. “We have secured standard accommodation for Kano pilgrims at places that are close to the Harams in both Makkah and Madinah,” he said. Dambatta said a total of 5,500 seats were allocated to Kano state for this year’s pilgrimage, urging the intending pilgrims that had not submitted their travelling passports to do so as soon possible to enable the board complete the ongoing registration exercise.
