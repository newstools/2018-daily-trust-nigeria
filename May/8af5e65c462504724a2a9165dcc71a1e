The wife of the chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Hajiya Hadiza Adamu Mustapha, has donated food items to some widows across the 10 wards of the council. Among the food items she donated were rice, beans, Semovita, cartons of Maggi seasoning cubes, vegetable oil, palm oil and bags of salt. She also made cash donation. Hajiya Hadiza, who visited  Ibwa, Dobi and Paiko wards  at the weekend,  said the gesture was to assist the less privileged ones especially the widows. She also said the support was given to ensure the women were carried along in the affairs of the council, adding that the items would ameliorate their suffering. She therefore urged the beneficiaries to make good use of the items presented to them, while urging them to also utilise the little funds given to them to start small businesses of their choice.
