Landlords and residents of Jikwoyi have threatened to sue the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) for allegedly overbilling them for electricity. The residents, during a protest on Tuesday, carried placards with inscriptions like, ‘Stop exploiting us in Jikwoyi,’ ‘Stop asking us to pay or repair facilities,’ and ‘Install prepaid metres,’ among others. The residents, who gave AEDC seven days ultimatum to stop overbilling them, said they would approach a court of law if the electricity company failed to meet their demand. The vice president of Jikwoyi Landlords Association, Julius Ogezi, said the community now paid high bills for electricity, adding that it had become increasingly difficult to cope with the charges imposed on them through estimated billing. “This unfortunate scenario has caused the collapse of most of our medium and small scale businesses and is a deep strain on our finances thereby depriving us of our means of livelihood. “We therefore view AEDC’s action as gross economic sabotage on our community and Nigerians in general,” he said. The chairman of Phase IV residents, Alfred Mathias Ebi, said despite being asked to buy and fix their transformer, AEDC still overbilled them and when they failed to pay, they would be disconnected and the staff of the  distribution company  take away the cables.
