Senator Philip Tanimu Aduda, representing the FCT, has alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) used thugs to snatch ballot boxes to defeat the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in the April 16, 2016 area councils elections in the FCT. Aduda spoke at the FCT PDP youth mobilization and strategic conference with the theme ‘Engaging the Youth Today for a Better Nigeria’, which  held at Apo town hall in Abuja at the weekend. He said the opposition PDP had learnt its lesson from the APC in the last FCT council elections, adding that the PDP was now fully prepared and remained law abiding to win the six area councils in the 2019 elections. According to him, since the advent of democracy, there was no reported case of a PDP member or supporter causing violence or snatching ballot boxes at polling units in any election in the FCT. “We have never snatched ballot box, we have never shot a gun because of election but in 2016 during the area council elections, they taught us lessons. But we too will be ready and continue to be law abiding to the Federal Government of Nigeria within the context of the law by reclaiming our six area councils in 2019,” he said. Aduda expressed confidence that with projects he executed across various communities in the six area councils, the electorate would support the PDP in the next area council elections. Also speaking, a former House of Representatives member for Abuja South, Alhaji Isah Egah Dobi, accused the ruling APC of rigging the last area  councils election in the FCT. “What happened during the last area council election was a clear rigging by the  APC not that PDP didn’t win but we have learnt our lesson and we shall surprise them in the 2019 council elections,” he said. The conference, which was organized by the FCT PDP youth, also had the national youth leader, Ude Okoye, national financial secretary, Abdullahi Maibasira, north central youth leader, Ismaila Aruwa, among top PDP stalwarts in attendance.
