Ten aid workers abducted in South Sudan last week have been released. The workers - kidnapped while travelling in a convoy near the southern city of Yei on April 25 - were transported from the area by an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) aircraft to the capital, Juba, on Monday, the group said in a statement. The three UN staff and seven aid workers from several different organisations are all South Sudanese nationals.
