A Federal High Court in Lagos has thrown out the suit by the alleged kidnapper, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, alias Evans, seeking recovery of his 25 Mack trucks in the custody of the police. The court, presided over by Justice Hadiza Rabiu-Shagari, dismissed the suit which also sought award of N200m against the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) and five other respondents. Justice Rabiu-Shagari ruled yesterday that by provisions of the constitution and Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015, the police have the right to seize and confiscate any items or properties as exhibit. The court also said it cannot stop the police or other security agencies from carrying out their constitutional duties. Consequently, Justice Rabiu-Shagari dismissed Evansâ€™ suit. In the suit, Evans, through his lawyer, Olukayode Ogungbeje, had sued the IGP, Nigeria Police Force (NPF), IGP Response Team, Lagos State Police Commissioner, and Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) before the court, seeking the release of 25 Mack trucks, which he said were seized from him. Evans had urged the Court to order the police to release the trucks to him through his lawyer. He had listed the number plates of some of the said trucks as BDG 78 XT, GGE 491 XU, FST 742 XT, AGL 219 XT, BDG 79 XT, AGL 222 XT, GGE 492 XU, AGL 220 XT and GGE 489 XU.
