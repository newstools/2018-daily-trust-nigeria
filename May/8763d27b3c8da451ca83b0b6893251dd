North Korea has cancelled Wednesday’s high-level talks with South Korea because of anger over its joint military exercises with the US. The North’s official KCNA news agency said the exercises were a “provocation” and a rehearsal for an invasion. It also warned the US over the fate of the historic summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump that is scheduled for 12 June. The US State Department said it was continuing to prepare for the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore and that it was not aware of any changes in the North Korean position. The talks with South Korea that had been scheduled for Wednesday were agreed earlier this week. They were to take place at Panmunjom, a military compound in the demilitarised zone between the two countries. Representatives from both countries had planned to discuss follow-up measures on agreements they had made at a rare summit on 27 April.
