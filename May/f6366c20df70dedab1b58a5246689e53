A former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives and chairman, governing board of Nigeria Investment Promotion commission (NIPC) Babangida Nguroje has expressed optimism that recent deployment of troops to Taraba State will end killings by bandits in the state. He described as apt, the decision by the Nigerian Air Force to establish a Quick Response Wing at Nguroje and deployment of special forces to boost security in the area. In a statement by his office yesterday in Abuja, Nguroje said “I urge the people of Taraba to assist and cooperate with the military personnel to achieve lasting peace, so that Taraba and Nigeria would migrate from the current insecurity to a major global investment destination.” He commended the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadiq Abubakar for his professionalism towards ensuring peace on Taraba State, saying “We appreciate President Muhammadu Buhari, the Taraba State Government and the host communities for giving peace a chance in the state”.
