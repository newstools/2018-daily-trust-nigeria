Taliban militants have attacked a police base in northern Afghanistan, killing or wounding 25 police officers and seizing another 31. The raid took place overnight in the Bilchragh district, Faryab province, a local official told the BBC. He said the fighting lasted five hours before the Islamists were pushed back. The attackers were reportedly armed with machine guns and used artillery. Both sides had heavy casualties, a local Afghan commander told the BBC. The Taliban launched what the group calls its spring offensive in early April.
