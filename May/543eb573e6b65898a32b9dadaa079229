Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the federal government is working to end clashes between farmers and herders and restore peace in the affected states. Osinbajo stated this yesterday at an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Camp in Awe local government area of Nasarawa State. The vice president said he was in Nasarawa State on the instruction of President Muhammadu Buhari “to hear from you and see for myself what is happening not only in this IDP camp but all the affected areas in the state and to bring enough security for you to return home and be able to do your work in peace.” “Both governors of Nasarawa and Benue states will be coming together with their security councils to rub minds as to how to bring about permanent peace. I will also be attending the meetings,” he added. He commended Governor Tanko Al-Makura for his patriotic disposition which helped to douse tension not only in Nasarawa and Benue states but the country at large. Earlier, Al-Makura told the vice president that what is most needed by IDPs is adequate security for them to return home. The governor said the recent anti-grazing law passed in Benue State cause much distraction for Nasarawa State because of the mass migration and quantum of people moving from Benue to Nasarawa.
