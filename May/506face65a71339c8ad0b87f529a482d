The governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-rufai, says in the event that aggrieved members of the nPDP decide to quit the All Progressives Congress, President Muhammadu Buhari will still win the 2019 presidential election. The governor said this in an interview with State House correspondents today. El-rufai said since 2003, Buhari had been winning elections in Kwara, Adamawa, Kano and Sokoto States where most of the nPDP members come from. The group recently petitioned the national chairman of the APC, John Odigie-Oyegun and copied President Buhari among other party big shots. The petition, dated April 27, was signed by the chairman of the nPDP, Abubakar Kawu Baraje and Secretary, Olagunsoye Oyipetition. Baraje had last WednesdayÂ led other members of the group to the national secretariat of the APC where they gave a seven-day ultimatum to meet President Buhari. The ultimatum elapses today. Governor El-rufai, however, said he agreed that the grievances of the group should be looked into with a view to accommodating them as "politics is a game of addition, not substraction."
