The Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris said it will be undemocratic, and against Senate Order 53 Rule 5 for him to appear before the Senate. The IGP, in a letter signed by Commissioner of Police, Legal/Prosecution David Igbodo and published in Daily Trust yesterday said he did not appear before the Senate on Wednesday due to pending cases he and Senator Dino Melaye filed before the courts. In the letter addressed to the President of the Senate, Idris said he has high regards and respect for the National Assembly and would not do anything to derogate their powers of oversight as recognised by the Constitution or slight them in any manner. He however said he had approached a Federal High Court in Abuja to decide whether the IGP must always appear in person each time he was invited to appear before the National Assembly despite his powers of delegation on official matters involving the police force. He said Senator Dino Melaye has also approached the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) seeking ten reliefs challenging the action of the inspector general of police and the Nigerian Immigration Service. “It is the belief of the Inspector General of Police that since the matter is now before a court of competent jurisdiction at both his and Senator Dino Melaye instance, the matter has become subjudicated and the court should be allowed to determine the matter,” the letter read. “The Inspector General of Police has on the basis above directed me to inform you that he will not be available to appear before the Senate on the 9th May 2018 or any other date pending the conclusion of the cases already pending in the courts,” CP Igbodo said. He said on 26 April when he was invited to brief the Senate, he was on official assignment with President Muhammadu Buhari to Bauchi, while on the 2nd May, the date for his second invitation, he was in Birnin-Gwari Area of Kaduna with the General Officer Commanding, One Division, Nigeria Army Kaduna.
