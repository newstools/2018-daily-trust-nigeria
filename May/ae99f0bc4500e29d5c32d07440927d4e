At least 14 people have been killed and 37 wounded in an explosion at a mosque in the Afghan province of Khost, local officials say. People had gathered for afternoon prayers at the mosque, which was also being used as a voter registration centre. Some of the injured are said to be in a critical condition. No group has claimed responsibility but the Islamic State group has carried out similar attacks in the past. There have been a number of attacks on voter registration centres since the process started last month for Octoberâ€™s parliamentary elections. On 22 April, a suicide bomb attack at a voter registration centre in the capital Kabul killed at least 57 people.
