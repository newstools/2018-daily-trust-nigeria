The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Yobe state on Saturday assured readiness to address the alleged marginalisation and disenfranchisement in the partys congresses across the state. A party stalwart and commissioner of education in the state, Alhaji Muhammad Lamin disclosed this in an interview with newsmen at the Congress venue in Damaturu. Lamin said it's normal to receive complains in every election but what happened in the congresses were purely in house problems that can be sort out without going to press or writing petitions. He said the alleged claims of marginalisation and imposition of executives at the ward congresses have been received by the leadership of the party. "Such allegations were made in other states, it's  an in-house problem, we don't have to be aggressive or volatile because in every election there are bound to be winners, losers and complainants but, we will sort it out very soon. "We expect the party faithful to endure the outcome because  it can't be me and me all the time. We are also happy that observations raised in the ward congress were taken care of and avoided in the local government congress", he added. Lamin said the congresses were peacefully conducted since the party had adopted affirmation of officials and returned them to office in line with the provisions of the party guideline. He also revealed that the party had received defectors from other parties recently, "Some with genuine interest while other with destructive selfish ambitions". Lamin explained that those with genuine interest to build the party will be given full opportunities and for those driven by destructive selfish ambitions will be effectively checked.
