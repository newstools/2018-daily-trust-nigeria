Vice President Yemi  Osinbajo yesterday assured Nigerians that it is now impossible to steal taxpayers’ money, as the present administration had made it very difficult to do so, in spite of the fact that corruption is desperately resisting efforts to check its spread. Speaking in Akure, the Ondo State capital at  the launch of the National Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) clinic, Osinbajo said instead of allowing the continuous theft of public funds, such funds would rather be invested on the masses. He said 5,272 persons had so far benefitted from the N-Power program in Ondo State while 78, 944 children were being fed daily under the home-grown school feeding program. The vice president added that there was the dire need for the federal government to provide a conducive environment for small businesses because they constitute 50 percent of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product and over 80 percent of the labour force. He said the MSME clinic in the state became necessary to ensure that small businesses grow. The vice president also paid a courtesy visit to the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladelusi Aladetoyinbo, where he solicited support for the All Progressives Congress (APC) government. Oba Aladetoyinbo, who earlier assured of his people’s support at all times, solicited the federal government’s assistance.
