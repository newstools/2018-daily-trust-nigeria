Armed policemen yesterday arrested 21 Jewish worshippers in Nnamdi Kanu’s residence in Afara Ukwu in Abia State. Shortly after the arrest, members of the organization reassembled and proceeded on a protest to the state command of the Nigerian Police demanding the release of the arrested members. Attempts to reach the Commissioner of Police on the arrest were not successful. But the Media and Publicity Secretary for the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Comrade Emma Powerful confirmed the arrest in a statement. He said “Some of the Jewish worshippers have been abducted and taken to unknown places, for easy execution. “We are calling on men and women of good conscience, the US embassy and all civilised nations to see reasons to fight and stop these barbaric moves against religious intolerance in Nigeria. He added that the only crime of the worshippers was to pray and spiritually sanctify the residence of the IPOB leader, whose whereabouts remained unknown.
