The chief of Wako in Kwali Area Council, Alhaji Ibrahim D. Usman, has said the present APC-led administration of Mr. Joseph K. Shazin has failed to impact on the lives of his subjects. Usman, who stated this when he received the chairman of PDP in the area,  Alhaji Mohammed Aruwa, in his palace yesterday, said there was no amenity in the community. He said since the past administrations of Samuel Gwamna, and Mohammed Gimba, no other administration has executed any project in the community. The chief said even employment which the present chairman ought to have given to graduates in the council were given to outsiders for political reasons. “To be sincere, our present council chairman has not helped us. After the past chairmen, late Samuel Gwamna,  Mohammed Gimba and Ibrahim Daniel, we don’t have any government presence again. I’m sorry to say, but there  is nothing to write home about the present government as there  are communities that are lacking  water and nothing has been done and allocation is being given as at when due,” he said. The traditional ruler, however,  commended the FCT senator, Philip Aduda,  for his effort in proving boreholes and solar lights at the community and other villages across the area councils. Earlier, the Kwali chapter chairman of the PDP,  Alhaji Aruwa, said they were embarking on inspection of some projects executed by Senator Philip Aduda in the area. He told the monarch that as they go round for the inspection, they would also take stock of any broken down boreholes at various villages in order to repair them. City News learnt that the team inspected boreholes with overhead tanks, primary health centres  and electrification project at Awawa, Bukpe,  Yebu,  Leleyi and  Gumbo in the council.
