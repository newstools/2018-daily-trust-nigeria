A Canadian man has lucked out - winning the lottery, celebrating his retirement and ringing in his birthday all within 24 hours. Vancouver man Ping Kuen Shum won the British Columbia lottery on April 28. Not only was it his last day of work, but it was also his birthday when he discovered that his single ticket matched all six numbers, winning him the $1.5million (N540 million) jackpot ($2million Canadian). The British Columbia Lottery Corporation has confirmed Shum’s winnings, which he accepted on Wednesday. ‘It’s unbelievable that all three events happened on the same day,’ Shum said to the BBC. The Corperation said the chances of getting all six numbers is a one in 13,983,816 chance.
