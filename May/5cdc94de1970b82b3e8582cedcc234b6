Suspected Boko Haram insurgents attacked a community along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway last night and exchanged gunfire with troops. The incident happened at Auno village in Konduga local government area of Borno State. A commercial driver, Yusuf Bakura, expressed the fear that many motorists and travellers might have been trapped. “We made a U-turn when we heard about the attack and we went back to Benishiek town but many motorists packed at Jakana village and asked their passengers to alight from the buses. The gun battle was unbearable. I am afraid that many drivers and passengers may have been trapped,” Yusuf said. According to a local vigilante source, the insurgents came in four Hilux vans mounted with anti-aircraft machines. The source said, “They wore military fatigue so we were confused, but the troops engaged them for about two hours in a serious fighting. Nobody can tell you the situation of things now in Auno. As I am speaking to you, we ran into the bushes because men are usually their targets.”
