The police  have arraigned two  scavengers, Mudasiru Adamu, 20, and Mohammed Bell,18, at a Karu magistrate’s court, Abuja, for alleged criminal trespass, house-breaking and theft. The defendants were arraigned on a four-count charge bordering on joint act, trespass, mischief, house-breaking and theft, offences they denied committing. The prosecutor, Vincent Osuji, told the court that one Austin Uzenda of Karu village Extension 2, Abuja, reported the matter at the Karu Police Station, Abuja, on May 18, around 6:00p.m. “The complainant alleged that on May 15, the defendants conspired and damaged his windows, broke into his apartment and stole some items and fled to an unknown destination. “The stolen items include one radio set with speakers, Tecno cell phone and six pieces of iron rods, which values were yet to be ascertained. However, on May 18, when the defendants returned to perpetrate other criminal acts, they were  apprehended, but all efforts to recover the stolen items proved abortive,” Osuji said. The prosecutor said the offences were contrary to and punishable under sections 348, 79, 353, 327 and 287 of the penal code. The judge, Mariam Saad, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N200,000, each, with one surety each in like sum and adjourned the case until June 18, for hearing. (NAN)
