Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the 68 registered political parties in the country yesterday in Abuja adopted and signed a new code of conduct to guide their conducts before, during and after the elections. This came at a validation workshop organised by the Political Parties Leadership and Policy Development Centre (PPLPDC) of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS). The Chief Operating Officer of the NIPSS-PPLPDC, Prof. Habu Galadima, said the code passed through rigorous expert reviews before being presented to the parties to deliberate and agree on it. Galadima said the code is however a voluntary Code of Conduct providing a set of rules of behaviour for political parties and their supporters relating to their participation in the election process. He said the centre was a beneficiary of a 2.7m Euros grant under the European Union Support for Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EUSDGN) to implement Component 3 of the project aimed to enhance pluralism, tolerance, internal democracy and equality of opportunity of political parties and the political party system. The Project Director of the European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES), David Le Notre, described parties as the primary stakeholders in the political system, and their conducts impact considerably on the electoral process and outcomes. The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu was represented by a National Commissioner INEC and Chairman Election and Party Monitoring Committee (EPMC) Prof Antonia Okoosi-Simbine.
