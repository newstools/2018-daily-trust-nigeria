The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has refuted reports that it has started a fresh recruitment exercise.  Bisi Kazeem, the Corps Public Education Officer revealed that the circulating FRSC website is Fake and was created by fraudsters to fleece unsuspecting applicants of money. “The Corps is using this medium to clarify that FRSC is at the moment not conducting any form of recruitment and will make it a public knowledge through major newspapers and other relevant media whenever such recruitment exercise is to take place as already approved by the Federal Government.” He said. Kazeem stated that the activities of the fraudsters are being investigated by relevant authorities while urging the general public to discountenance the current portal linked to the Corps in the internet and other media platforms. He however noted that the FRSC has the approval of President Buhari to recruit qualified Nigerians into the services of the Corps but advertisement has not been made public yet. “His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari has graciously given approval for the recruitment of qualified Nigerians into the services of the Corps, but the advertisement has not been made public yet. “The Corps has established mechanisms to achieve a smooth exercise and these established processes are presently undergoing scrutiny to ensure a flawless and smooth exercise. When we are ready, the public will be properly informed through adverts in the national dailies”. He further stressed that whenever the Corps is recruiting, information on such will be readily made available through the following official platforms. www.frsc.gov.ng, www.fb.com/federalroadsafetycorps or @FRSCNigeria on Twitter. The Corps can also be reached through a toll free line 122 or 070022553772, 08077690055 and 08077690397 for any confirmation or clarification on recruitment and other matters concerning the organization.
