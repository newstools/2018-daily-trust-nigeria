Hundreds of thugs suspected to be supporting a faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC)  in Rivers State yesterday vandalised the State High Court, looting and destroying property. Some aggrieved APC members who were disenfranchised in last week’s ward congress of the party in the state had gone to court to restrain the party from conducting today’s congress. Witnesses said supporters of the APC had barricaded the entrance gate to the court,  provoking PDP supporters who equally invaded the court premises and chased the APC supporters away. In the ensuing melee, property belonging to the court were vandalised while vehicles parked within the premises were destroyed. A judge was reportedly manhandled. There were separate injunctions in support and against today’s congress. While a High Court in Port Harcourt restrained the party from conducting the congress, a Federal High Court was said to have given an order for it to go ahead. Governor Nyesom  Wike said that the  attack was an attempt by the police and APC to overthrow the state government. He said it was unfortunate that the police connived with leaders of the APC to close the courts and stop it from dispensing justice to Rivers people.
