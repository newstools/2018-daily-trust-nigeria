A cross section of Nigerians in Europe have decried the high fees charged for  Circumcision of baby boys in clinics.

The Europe Correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesay in Bern,  reports that the procedure is not common in many hospitals therefore parents patronise clinics – with cost  ranging between 467.85 Euro (N200,000) and  1,169.62 Euro (N500, 000).

Although this vary from country to country.

Speaking on the issue, Mr Uche Erebuna, a member of the Nigerian In Diaspora Organisation (NIDO) Switzerland, said that the cost of circumcision depended on the weight of the child.

“ Baby circumcision is not a common practice here, so immigrants who have this culture have to look for clinics where  doctors can perform it”

“ I have twin boys and they were circumcised at the age of one. I paid 1,637.15 Euro (about N700,000) for both of them.

“ This is considered cheap as it could have been about a million naira” Erebuna said.

Similarly, Mrs Gloria Edema,  a housewife with two male children aged four and two said that her kids were circumcised at two months old respectively.

“ On both occasions, i paid 500 Swiss franc (N170,000) per child  to a clinic in Zurich”

“ I can not start traveling to Nigeria for this purpose, it will cost me  more “.

Some others who spoke to NAN from Italy, France and Germany also expressed the same concern .

They opined that the high cost was due to the speciality of the process- which is a regular practice among immigrants.

NAN gathered that  however,  in the UK, the cost for such procedure is a lot cheaper given the big immigrant and  Jewish communities – with affordable and easy access to medical practitioners(NAN)
