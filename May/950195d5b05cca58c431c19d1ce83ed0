Justice Okon Abang has ordered the continuation of the trial of former spokesman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Olisah Metuh, despite the defendant’s collapse in court. Metuh yesterday collapsed and remained motionless on the floor of the court while making his way to the dock in continuation of his trial over alleged receipt of N400 million     arms funds from former National Security Adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuki in 2014. A court medical official, who examined Metuh, suggested he be urgently moved to a hospital for further examination. Justice Abang, however vowed to proceed with the trial despite Metuh’s condition, wondering why a doctor who was not in the courtroom when Metuh fell down, would request he be taken to hospital. Defence counsel, Emeka Etiaba (SAN) informed the court of his intention to withdraw his services as he would not continue to represent Metuh in that condition. Meanwhile, the judge has threatened to strike out the case following the decision of the EFCC’s counsel, Sylvanus Tahir not to oppose the adjournment of the case, despite his order for the defendant to produce his eleventh witness. “If the prosecution does not want to proceed with the trial, the court will strike out the case,” the judge said.
