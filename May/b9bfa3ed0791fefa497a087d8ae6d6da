 A chairmanship aspirant in Kwali Area Council on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 council polls, Ibrahim Fazhi Mohammed, has advocated for zoning of the position in the area. Mohammed, who spoke during a meeting with party chieftains and stakeholders at Sheda village, yesterday, said adopting zoning would enhance inclusiveness as people from other areas of the council who had not had the opportunity to produce chairman would now have the possibility in doing so. He said Kwali town has been producing chairman since the inception of democracy in 1999, noting that it was high time all stakeholders of the council came together to unanimously adopt zoning system to enable the next chairman of the council to emerge from rural Kwali. He said he was contesting for the chairmanship of the council in 2019 in response to the clarion call of the good people of the council. “I observed that it is high time all the stakeholders came together to sit down to adopt the zoning system, where a chairman should come from the rural area this time around because since 1999, Kwali town has been producing chairman,” he said. The aspirant said he was impressed with the just concluded APC ward and local government congress in the council, which he said were held without rancour. He thank the incumbent chairman of the council, Joseph K. Shazin, and the FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, for creating a level playing ground for the exercise. Mohammed urged members and supporters of the party to continue to support the present administration in order to provide democratic dividends to the people.
