A  27-year-old man, Bashir Ismaila, lost his life during a scuffle with another man, whose name was not immediately known, in Gwagwalada town. A witness said the incident happened on Sunday afternoon on Park Road, when the deceased attempted to snatch a phone from the man. He said the deceased, who resided at Anguwar Gbagyi, allegedly accosted the man to snatch his phone, but the man overpowered him and proceeded to hit him. “The deceased ran home and came back with a knife to stab the man. He inflicted cuts on him, which prompted some bystanders to join the melee. At the end of it all, Ismaila was beaten to a state of unconsciousness,” he said. He said the deceased’s family members rushed him to hospital where doctors confirmed him dead. Our reporter learnt that Ismaila was Gbagyi by tribe and his death created tension in the area. Some Igbo traders there quickly closed their shops after noticing that some youths were mobilising for a reprisal attack. It was gathered that it took the intervention of the chairman of the council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, and the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP David Kolo, who rushed to the scene to calm the situation. When contacted, the DPO confirmed the incident, saying the remains of the deceased had been handed over to his relatives for burial. He the man said to have fought with the deceased would be transferred to the state CID for further investigation.
