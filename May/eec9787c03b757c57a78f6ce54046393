Former Governor of Kaduna State, Alhaji Ramalan Yero, has been detained at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) zonal office in Kaduna. The former governor was detained with the former Kaduna State PDP Chairman, Abubakar Gaya  Haruna,  former Secretary to the state government, Hamza Ishaq and former minister, Nuhu Somo Wya.  The four persons have been reporting at the EFCC office for the past two months in line with the procedure for their investigation.  Inside sources at the EFCC said when they went to report this morning at the EFCC office, they were detained as they would be arraigned in court tomorrow.  “The case is coming up tomorrow so I can confirm to you that the former governor is here with us and he will be arraigned at the courts with the three others,’ said a source at the EFCC who does not want to be named.  Yero is under investigation for the role he played in the disbursement of the N750 million PDP campaign fund before the 2015 general election.  Kaduna zonal spokesman of the EFCC, Kamaludeen Gebi could not be reached as at the time of filing this report.  The former governor and the trio were interrogated last week and made to sign some documents as part of the procedure for being under investigation but were allowed to go home after that. They were held back today due to the case coming up at the court tomorrow .
