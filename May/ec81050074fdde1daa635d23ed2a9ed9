A suspected motorcycle thief identified only as Ahmad was on Sunday morning lynched by a mob along Park Road, Gwagwalada. A witness identified as Yahuza, said the suspect was arrested at a tea joint along Park Road, after some people had traced him. He said the incident happened when the suspect, his younger brother and one other person, who is still at large, allegedly snatched a motorcycle at Gwako village in the area on Friday night. He said the younger brother to the deceased was arrested on Saturday, and was beaten up and handed over to the police in Gwagwalada. He said the third suspect who was still at large escaped with the motorcycle on that Friday night and was yet to be seen. “The suspect didn’t even know they were looking for him until that morning when they saw him taking tea and a mob that gathered lynched him on the spot,” he said. He said the mob hit him with stones and logs of wood until he died. A commercial cyclist, Shehu Kabiru, said the rate at which motorcycles were being snatched in Gwagwalada metropolis was quite alarming, adding that no day passed by without report of motorcycle snatching in the area. “In fact, just last Thursday night, along Kuje junction a cyclist was killed and his motorcycle was taken away,” he said. When contacted, Gwagwalada Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP David Kolo, said it was disturbing that a mob took the law into their hands and carried out jungle justice. He said the division was investigating the incident and that those responsible for the  killing would be arrested and prosecuted in a court of law.
