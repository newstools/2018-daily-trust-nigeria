The police in Lagos have arrested a 51-year-old man, Godwin Udo Akpan, for alleged sexual assault of his six-year-old daughter. Our correspondent gathered that Akpan, who had been separated from the girl’s mother for some years, brought his daughter, who was living with her mother in Ikot Epene, Akwa Ibom State, back to Lagos to be residing with him. The suspect was said to be leaving the custody of the girl with a female neighbour, Mama Winner, a fellow member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), anytime he was going to work. The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Imohimi Edgal, who confirmed the arrest, said that the bubble about Akpan’s alleged illicit relationship with his daughter burst on Sunday when the girl refused to go home with her father. Edgal said that when church members probed her on why she wouldn’t, the small girl, whose name he withheld, opened up on her ordeal in the hands of her father. The police chief said, “The girl told the woman that she would not go home with her father because he had been inserting his finger in her private part. It is the woman that reported the incident to the  police. “On interrogation, the suspect confessed, saying he was propelled by the devil to defile his six-year-old daughter. He said he has repented and has appealed to God and the public to forgive him.” He said investigation revealed that Akpan had been  abusing his daughter since January 2018.
