An electronics dealer, Abubakar Baba, who was abducted by gunmen has been set free after payment of N500,000 ransom. City News had reported that the victim was abducted last week at his residence at Naharati in Abaji town, after he closed from his shop. A source close to the victim who preferred anonymity confided in our reporter yesterday that the victim was released at about 2:00am at the weekend after the money was paid. He said the kidnappers released the victim after they received the ransom at a location where they directed the relatives to take the ransom to. “Actually, they phoned the man who was negotiating with them and asked him to take the ransom to where they directed him. But they released the victim in a different place from where they collected the ransom,” he said. Our reporter also learnt that the district head of Gulida in Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Umar Awoke, who was also abducted by kidnappers two weeks ago had also been set free by his abductors after payment of N300,000 ransom. A family member of the victim, who also preferred anonymity, told our reporter yesterday that the victim was released last Wednesday night near Gawu forest. He said some elders of the community had to contribute money before they could raise the amount and a chemist at the village took the ransom to them before the chief was set free. “In fact, the family sold yam and the elders of the community contributed money to raise that amount. We thank God he came back alive,” he said. When contacted, the Abaji Divisional Police Officer (DPO) confirmed the release of the district but denied payment of ransom.
