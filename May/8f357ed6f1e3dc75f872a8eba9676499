The European Union has disclosed that about 111 Nigerian migrants in Libya are expected to return to the country today. The Head of EU Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ambassador Ketil Karlsen stated this yesterday in Abuja, while briefing newsmen on the forthcoming Europe Day on May 9. He said the EU, in partnership with International Organisation for Migration (IOM), has facilitated the safe and voluntary return of 7,720 Nigerians over the last months. The envoy said situation of the Nigerian migrants trapped in Libya was a matter of priority to the EU, noting that the union was intensifying dialogue with partners on finding a durable and long term solution to the problem of irregular migration. “For us it is vital that the return is done in an orderly manner where the returnees are given an opportunity to start life again. We are partnering with IOM to give them funding and vocational training for them to start something,” Karlsen said. As part of efforts to address the root cause of irregular migration, he said the EU has established Trust Fund aimed at investing in youth through training and job creation.
