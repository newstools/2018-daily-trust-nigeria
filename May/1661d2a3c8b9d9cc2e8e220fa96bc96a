The newly deployed Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the National Assembly, SP Sambo Abdullahi has resumed. Abdullahi took over from CSP, Abdul Sulu-Gambari who has been transferred to Adamawa State. At a brief ceremony, Sulu-Gambari handed over to Abdullahi yesterday around 11.am with few senior officers in the division in attendance. Sulu-Gambari was removed on Saturday as the National Assembly probes the invasion of Senate chamber by thugs. Suspected thugs numbering five had on April 18, invaded the Senate and carted away with the Mace, the symbol of authority of the Senate. Sulu-Gambari had told the investigative panel that six persons arrested in connection with the invasion have been handed over to the Police higher authorities. His revelation punctured the earlier claim by the Police authorities that no one was been arrested in connection with the invasion.
