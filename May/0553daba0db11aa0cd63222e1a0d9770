The Chairman of Kuje Area Council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has called for the cancellation of the Kuje central ward APC congress held on Saturday in the area. Addressing newsmen, yesterday, the chairman said though he was satisfied with the congress across the remaining wards, that of Kuje central ward was said to have been marred by violence. He said he was dissatisfied with  the outcome of the Kuje central ward congress because some members of the congress committee failed to adhere to the directive of the FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello. “In fact, some members of the congress committee went and filled different names in the forms. It was at that point that argument broke out and some group of people came and disrupted the entire exercise and even beat up my aide. “As far as I am concerned, there was absolutely no congress in Kuje central ward, hence, it should be cancelled,” he added.
