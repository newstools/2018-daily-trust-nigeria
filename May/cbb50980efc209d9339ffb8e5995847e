The senate president added that the future and well being of the Nigerian children, especially those at the IDPs camps in various states of the federation including Benue was paramount to the country, stressing that it was their responsibility as leaders to work out bright future for all the children.

He said the senate would ensure that the rights of children are provided to enable them get good and free education, access healthcare and security of their lives while emphasising that part of the necessities were already embedded in the 2018 budget.

Saraki maintained that the senate would do whatever is required for the huge number of displaced persons in the eight different camps in the state to go back to their homes, noting that they have asked security chiefs during a meeting last week to place their demand for enough funding to nib the killings in the bud.
