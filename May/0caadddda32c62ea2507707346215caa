The World Health Organisation has conferred a gold medal on Graca Machel, who stepped down as chair of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH) in Geneva on Sunday. Machel is wife of late South African leader Nelson Mandela, and has chaired the global partnership for the last 12 years, insisting its mandate should remain strong. “Our mandate is not about reducing but about ending preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, children and adolescents,” said Machel. “The end goals of our work makes you feel, ‘do I deserve it while all these people are dying daily?” “It is 12 years only. If we don’t change the way we are doing things, we can’t afford-come 2030-to tell mothers in this era when knowledge and resources are available, we cannot look into their eyes and tell them we have failed. We cannot do that. We are not allowed to do that.” Former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet takes over as chair of the partnership. The partnership is a coalition of governments, nongovernment organisations, civil society, United Nations and donor agencies with a streamlined mandate to ensure survival of women, newborns and children across the world.
