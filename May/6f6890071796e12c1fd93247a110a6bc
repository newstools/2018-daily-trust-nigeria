The acting Executive Secretary of Primary Health Care Development Board (PHCDB), Dr. Mathew Ashikene, has said the board was partnering with the Business Professional Women (BFW), to improve vaccination in the territory. Ashikene stated this at the African Vaccination Week (AVW) held in Abuja on Tuesday. He said receiving routine immunization was essential in attaining the highest standard on health, especially among children. He said about two to three million children between the ages of one to five years die every year in the African region, saying the high numbers could be prevented through vaccines. Ashikene, however, said the FCT administration placed priority to the call for revitalization of the primary healthcare systems in the country. “The healthcare system has been repositioned such that it will actualize its development as well as delivery of high impact, result oriented and cost effective programme targeted at substantially reducing the maternal, new born, and child mortality in FCT,” he said.
