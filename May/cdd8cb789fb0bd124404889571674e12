The Nasrul-Lahi-L-Fatih Society of Nigeria (NASFAT) Abuja Chapter has called for amendment to the 1999 Constitution regarding the secular or religious nature of the country. The Chief Imam of the society, Sheikh Sharafudeen Aliagan, made the call yesterday in Abuja at the NASFAT annual Ramadan Lecture titled “Quran and the Rule of Law”. The scholar said Nigeria’s constitution is faulty as the country is being regarded as a secular state against the reality that at every public function, Christian and Muslim prayers were officially held. “Nigeria cannot be said to be an Islamic State because in an Islamic state Quran is the operational law, which is Shariah and with Nigerian Constitution Nigeria is not an Islamic state. You cannot be a Muslim and disrespect the law of the land. It is incumbent on every one of us to have total respect for the rule of law and constituted authority. It is when you abide by the law of the land that you are regarded as a good Muslim and no other way round,” Aliagan said. He urged Muslims to do more of intellectual Jihad, saying that there is nothing like war of sword and arrow in the 21st Century. The Branch Chairman of the society, Dr Nasir Raji, enjoined Muslims to eschew violence and make peace not only during Ramadan but at all times.
