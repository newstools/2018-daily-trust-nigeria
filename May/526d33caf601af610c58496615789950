The  Governor of Borno State Kashim Shettima said the government resolved to  accept the repented and deradicalised members of the Boko Haram  insurgents, as part of peace building process in the crisis hit areas.

Shettima  disclosed this during his speech at the closing ceremony of the two-day  Lake Chad Basin Governors’ Forum for Regional Cooperation on  Stabilisation, Peace-building and Sustainable Development in Maiduguri  on Wednesday.

He  noted that it was impossible to fight darkness with darkness, hence the  decision to re-absolve the repented insurgents into the society.

"Governments  of the region have the largeness of heart to embrace and to reintegrate  into the society, the deradicalised members of Boko Haram", he said.

The  governor observed that military option alone could not solve the  challenges of the Lake Chad Basin, calling for a more multi-dimensional  approach.

"We  want the military, political, social and economical approaches in  solving the challenges of the Lake Chad Basin," he stressed.

Shettima  said the governors of the Lake Chad Basin had reached a consensus to do  a comprehensive compilation of the problems facing the basin with the  intention to finding solutions to them.

In  the communique released after the two-day meeting, it was agreed among  the Lake Chad Basin governors to use a community-based approach in  ensuring sustainability and ownership of solutions to the Boko Haram  crisis in the Lake Chad Basin.

Besides,  it was also agreed that Lake Chad Basin Governors’ Forum will be used  to enhance joint efforts towards stabilizing, building peace and  fostering sustainable development in the basin.

Governors from Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria attended the two-day meeting.
