The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Muhammad Musa Bello, has presented certificates of allocation to some shop owners at Kurudu Relocation Market. Bello, who was represented by the mandate secretary, Area Council Services Secretariat, Adamu Abubakar Bappah, made the presentation during an inspection tour of projects executed by the chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido. Kurudu Relocation Market was constructed by AMAC-Investment Property Development Company. The minister said: “It’s great. Going round to commission these projects is very encouraging, this shows that at least the APC government is working. “Candido has opened the market for economic viability and then for the youths to get jobs there are roads linking the communities for investors that want to do business.” Candido said the project was a dividend of democracy, adding that the market was another avenue to strengthen the economic viability of the council. “We are trying to strengthen the economic viability of this council. What we are putting on ground will go beyond this administration. “I'm interested in a better AMAC. Whatever we are putting on ground is to sustain the economy,” he said.
