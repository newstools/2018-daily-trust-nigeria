The old pictures of under-aged voters that went viral during the recent local government elections in Kano State were shopped from the archives to discredit the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the state electoral commission in Kano, a report has shown. There were widespread allegations of under-aged voting during the February 10 elections for the 44 chairmanship and 484 councillorship positions conducted by Kano State Independent Electoral Commission (KANSIEC). INEC was also alleged to have compromised the process on the grounds that its voters’ register, which was purportedly used for the Kano elections, had voters below 18 years. This prompted the National Chairman of INEC, Professor Mahmud Yakubu, to set up an eight-man committee headed by Engr. Abubakar Nahuce to ascertain if the voter register requested by KANSIEC was used for the election. The committee’s report, according to sources, would be presented on Friday, with one of them saying analysis revealed that some of the pictures showing children voting   were photoshopped while others were taken during previous elections. He said some of the pictures used in the social media to discredit the Kano LG polls were actually taken during elections in Taraba in 2015, Nasarawa in 2011 and Sokoto in 2012.
