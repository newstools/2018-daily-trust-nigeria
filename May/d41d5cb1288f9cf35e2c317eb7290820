The Lagos State police command has arrested a 25-year-old man, Ekene Onyetube, for allegedly raping a lady, Precious, that he met on facebook. Onyetube, of No. 3, Sound Foundation, Ilogbo Road, Ajangbadi, was said to have met Precious, 28, on the social media sometime last year and they became friends on facebook. The police said that the suspect later invited the lady to Lagos from her base in Enugu. When she arrived in Lagos on May 5, 2018, our correspondent learnt, Onyetube took her to De-Didos Hotel, Shibiri, where they both lodged. The police added that it was while they were in the hotel room that the suspect drugged Precious’ drink and raped her. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who confirmed the arrest, said the suspect also made away with his victim’s Infinix Note 3 phone, one Nokia touch phone and her voter’s card. Edgal said that during investigation after Precious had reported her plight at the Ilemba-Hausa police station, Ajangbadi, stakeholders, who were mainly hoteliers, assisted the police in circulating Onyetube’s details to hotels in the area and to all the nooks and crannies of Ajangbadi.
