The chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT, Alhaji Abdulmalik Usman, has constituted a five-man committee to investigate the immediate and remote  causes of the attack on the chairman of Kuje Area Council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, and his vice, Samuel Tanko Duda. Galadima and Duda were attacked by thugs after the party stakeholders’ meeting last Thursday, in which the windscreens of their vehicles were smashed. The party chairman, who addressed newsmen in Gwagwalada, while monitoring the party’s ward congress on Saturday, said he was saddened over the incident. He wondered what issues necessitated  the attack, saying APC was  like a family  and whatever were the grievances of the members, they ought to have channelled them through the party hierarchy. He said the party would ensure that peace and unity reigned among all members and its supporters across the six area councils, and urged members and supporters to be law abiding to constituted authorities. Usman expressed satisfaction over the outcome of the party ward congresses across the area councils, which he said was rancour free.
