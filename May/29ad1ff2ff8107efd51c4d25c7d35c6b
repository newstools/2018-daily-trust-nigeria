The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bola Tinubu, has described yesterday’s ward congresses across the country as open and a demonstration of the believe in the tenets of democracy. In a statement yesterday by Head of Tinubu’s Media Office, Tunde Rahman, the APC chieftain explained that things are going according to plan, very open and the congresses were a transparent process. He said the APC are demonstrating to the people across the country that it is a law-abiding political party. “They queue up behind whoever they want, no pre-ordained candidate. The turn-out is very impressive. The membership of the party is growing in leaps and bounds and open to all democrats who want to identify with us,” he said. He pointed out that “This is one of the best ways to energize the party that is almost remaining dormant at the grassroots level and you could see the sense of belonging and the energy and activities of the ordinary people. It is a great joy for me.” Chief Tinubu said “Until the various officials who are here to conduct the congresses write their reports, my own admonition is to continue to appeal to our party members to conduct themselves peacefully and to comply with the rule of law.” On the suspended Ekiti State governorship primaries, he believed that those in charge will do the right thing. “I have put my own political gear in neutral. I have no anointed candidate. Everyone there aspiring and contesting are very dear members and they deserve the right to participate,” the APC chieftain said. “About 33 of them in all and we only need one of them for governorship. We have had leadership discussions. I like the fact that they showed up respectfully and are all committed to the peace and stability of the party in that state,” he said.
