The Lagos State government has revealed plans to kick-start mass production of rice at the Imota Rice Mill, Ikorodu, by February 2019. The mill has a production capacity of 32,000 tonnes per hour. The state’s Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Ade Akinsanya, disclosed this during an inspection tour of the mill, alongside other members of the State Executive Council. According to Akinsanya, the entire area, covering 8,000 square metres, including space for a light industrial park, would create jobs for 250,000 people. The commissioner  noted that the mill would also have a warehouse to accommodate 20,000 metric tonnes of rice. He said the rice, in large quantity, would be available to residents of the state and other south-west states early next year, as the state government was stepping up work at the mill. The team also inspected the ongoing project at the regional food market in Imota, where the Mile 12 market and other markets in the environs would be relocated.
