Saudi Arabia has agreed to release 1,000 Ethiopian nationals who have been in prison in the Gulf state for a variety of offences, Ethiopian state-affiliated media said. The decision was made after a request by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was in Riyadh on an official two-day visit that ended on Saturday, Fana Broadcasting Corporation reported on Saturday. Among the detainees were 100 women, the agency said, without disclosing what charges they were held on. The prisoners will be released on Sunday, the news agency added. Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopian nationals live in the Gulf region, mostly in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh has not commented on the report.
