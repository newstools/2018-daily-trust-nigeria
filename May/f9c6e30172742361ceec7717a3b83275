An oil worker abducted during a joint investigative visit to an oilfield owned by Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) in Kalaba community of Bayelsa State on  April 19, 2018, has been released. According to a community source in Kalaba and Ayambele in Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state, the victim was dropped off by his abductors on Friday near Igbogene area of Yenagoa. It was gathered that the abducted oil worker was part of a technical crew deployed to clamp a ruptured pipeline that caused an oil spill which affected Kalaba and neighbouring Ayambele settlements in Yenagoa Local Government Area. The joint investigative visit report had indicated that the pipeline was ruptured in five spots by vandals. Another resident, Mr Neville Aristotle Inogula, who confirmed the release of the oil worker alleged that the act was carried out by some ‘identified’ persons from rival communities to paint the area black He said that the entire people of Kalaba community condemned the incident and vowed to comb the forests and creeks to free any other abducted oil worker as kidnapping was alien to the people. He said, “we were disturbed and all resolved to clear the name of our community; we said no to kidnapping, it was a ploy by some other communities who are our rivals to make us look bad. “The pressure mounted by fellow community youths (Akumoni community) and security agencies led to the release of the abducted Agip staff in the early hours of Friday’’. The Bayelsa Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) Mr Godwin Nwachukwu, said his command is currently investigating the incident, but was yet to confirm the victim’s release.
