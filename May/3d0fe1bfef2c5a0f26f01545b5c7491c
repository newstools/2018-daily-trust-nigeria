A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet aircraft killed scores of Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) while providing Close Air Support (CAS) to ground troops of the Nigerian Army troops. The successful air strike by the NAF Alpha Jet aircraft followed calls from the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 8 Division of the Nigerian Army (NA) that troops conducting clearance operations at Koleram had come in contact with Boko Haram terrorists. In a statement signed by the Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya he explained that the GOC had requested for support from the NAF when the Army troops encountered the terrorist  sequel to which the Alpha Jet aircraft was immediately scrambled to provide CAS. Adesanya added that ‎on arrival over the location, there were exchanges of fire between BHTs and our Nigerian Army ground forces. The statement reads in part, "The crew of a Nigerian Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft established contact with the ground troops and guided the Alpha Jet aircraft crew to the major source of fire from the BHTs, which was seen coming from a particular settlement. " Consequently, the NAF Alpha Jet aircraft engaged the target with rockets and cannons thus neutralizing the BHTs and destroying their weapons". Adesanya added that the Air Task Force will continue to conduct missions, on request, in support of the efforts of our troops in the counterinsurgency operations in the Northeast.
