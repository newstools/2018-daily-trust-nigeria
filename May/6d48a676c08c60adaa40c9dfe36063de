At present, President Muhammadu Buhari is in London, United Kingdom, two days after he left Washington DC where he had visited American President, Donald Trump. President Buhari had left Washington DC on Tuesday after meeting with President Trump on Monday. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, explained Thursday that this was due to a technical stopover. Shehu did not explain what he meant by the technical stopover, but assured that the president would soon return to Nigeria. "They had a technical stopover in London. I am sure if you keep your ears to the ground, you will hear of his arrival soon," Shehu said. President Buhari was in London last year for several months to treat an undisclosed ailment. Daily Trust reports that Buhari was scheduled to spend this weekend in his country home of Daura, Katsina State. The president's advance team, comprising of security operatives, protocol staff and journalists, left Abuja for Katsina State on Thursday.
