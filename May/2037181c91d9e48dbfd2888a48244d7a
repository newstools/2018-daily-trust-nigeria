There was low turnout of voters during the local government election held yesterday in Nasarawa State.

Speaking with newsmen shortly after casting his vote at his Wambai polling unit in Gayam ward, Lafia LGA, Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura, said he was satisfied with the peaceful conduct of the election. “I am so happy to cast my vote as an indigene of Nasarawa State. I am delighted to know especially from information reaching me that the exercise is going smoothly and peaceful across the state,” he said. Al-Makura said, “people are orderly complying with the regulations and the processes in virtually all the places. I received reports that accreditation has been concluded and election is been conducted peacefully. Like you can see from my electoral ward that the turnout is impressive and I believe this election will be free and fair, credible and acceptable to all.” Responding to journalists on the low turnout at Daddare town in Obi LGA, Chairman of the Nasarawa State Universal Basic Education Board (NSUBEB) Danazumi Muhammed, said, “averagely, the turnout is okay and one can understand why people are not fully participating as expected because one of the strongest political parties, the PDP, refused to participate in the election on reasons best known to them. Like in our own case we have only one candidate for the chairmanship but some political parties fielded candidates for councillorship election in Obi LGA.” On his part, Speaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi,  hailed the peaceful conduct of the election across the state.
