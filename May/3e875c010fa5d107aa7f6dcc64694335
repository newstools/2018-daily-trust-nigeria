Indian MP and former UN diplomat Shashi Tharoor has been charged with aiding his wife’s suicide in 2014. Sunanda Pushkar’s unexplained death was initially treated as suicide but police later said she had been murdered, without naming a suspect. Police in Delhi have now charged Mr Tharoor with abetment to suicide and cruelty to his spouse. Mr Tharoor tweeted to say he intended to “vigorously” contest the “preposterous charges” against him.  Mr Tharoor, an MP with India’s main opposition Congress party, married Ms Pushkar, a former Dubai-based businesswoman, in 2010.
