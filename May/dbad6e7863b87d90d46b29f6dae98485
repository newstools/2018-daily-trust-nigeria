The family of a small boy dramatically rescued after dangling from a balcony in Paris, France have expressed their thanks to the Malian man who saved him. “He’s truly a hero,” the boy’s grandmother said of migrant Mamoudou Gassama, who scaled four floors to pluck the child from danger. The four-year-old’s father, who had left him in their flat and gone shopping, faces charges of failing to look after his child, reports say. Mr Gassama will be given citizenship. French President Emmanuel Macron personally thanked him, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service. More details have begun to emerge of the circumstances surrounding the incident. The boy had already fallen two storeys before somehow managing to grab hold of the fourth-floor balcony, according to this version of events.
