Press freedom comes with great responsibility and media practitioners must uphold ethical journalism to combat hate speech, said to be a major contributor to ethnic or religious violence. This was the position of speakers on Friday at a World Press Freedom Day function organized by the United States Embassy in Abuja. With the theme, “The impact of hate speech on Press Freedom”, they charged media practitioners on responsible journalism and avoid promoting issues that are capable of destabilizing the country. The US Ambassador to Nigeria, Stuart Symington, represented by Aruna Amirthanayagam, said the media could help prevent further killing of innocent Nigerians by being responsible in their reportage. The envoy, who stressed the need for press freedom, called for more public enlightenment in curtailing hate speech instead of gaging the press. Senate spokesperson, Sabi Abdullahi, who sponsored hate speech bill in the upper chamber, said the plan is not to gag the press but to prevent deaths which emanate from hate speech. He said the high number of deaths associated with hate speech necessitates the introduction of laws to curtail the menace.
