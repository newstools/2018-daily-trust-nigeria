Thirty one persons travelling at two different times along the Birnin Gwari- Kaduna road have been abducted by yet to be identified gunmen. The first incident involving a Sharon bus happened around 7 pm on Tuesday where nine passengers and a driver were stopped by the bandits at a town known as Ladi, close to Buruku and led into the bush. As early as 7: 00 am on Wednesday three Golf cars carrying six passengers and the drivers, travelling together for security reasons, were also stopped and both the passengers and the drivers led into bush. The female passengers in the vehicles were said to have been asked to take off their clothes before being led into the bush by the gunmen. Chairman of the Taxi section of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Birnin Gwari, Malam Danladi Idon Duniya who confirmed the abductions said the villagers found clothes belonging to female passengers in the cars. “They probably stripped the women among them of their clothes before taking them away but up till now nobody has contacted us,” he said. He said the bandits no longer hide in the bushes but sit by the roads ‘as if they are policemen’ and flag down any oncoming vehicle they see. The NURTW chairman said because of the frequency of attacks on the road from Birnin Gwari to Funtua, no commercial vehicle has plied that route for two months now. The police public relations officer in Kaduna State, Hussain Muhktar Aliyu said he will confirm the details and get back to our correspondent.
