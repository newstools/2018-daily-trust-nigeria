Cristiano Ronaldo is closing in on a stunning return to Manchester United from Real Madrid, according to reports.

Ronaldo could leave Real Madrid this summer with Manchester United supposedly in the mix for his signature.

The 33-year-old has hinted at a move away from the Bernabeu following Real’s 3-1 Champions League final victory over Liverpool last night.

And Spanish outlet Diario Gol have made a huge claim by saying Cristiano Ronaldo has already agreed a stunning return to United.

The Red Devils have long harboured hopes of bringing their former No 7 home.

In 2013, United were sure he would come back to lift the mood following Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.

Upon learning David Moyes was taking over, however, he had a huge change of heart.

In 2015, United again thought there was a chance Ronaldo would quit Real for an emotional return.

However, Ronaldo instead used their interest to negotiate a huge wage increase.

Diario Gol say the Portugal star has already given United his word, reaching a pre-agreement with Jose Mourinho.

But that does not necessarily mean he will actually seal a huge return.

It is claimed Ronaldo also has an offer to leave from PSG.

The Ligue 1 giants are preparing for life without Neymar, who is on both Real and United’s radar.

Ronaldo could even swap places with the Brazilian.
