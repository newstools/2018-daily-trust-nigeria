President Hassan Rouhani says Tehran will stay in the JCPOA with other signatories, stressing that Iran has always complied with its commitments to the JCPOA, while the US has never complied with its requirements. Rouhani made the remarks on Tuesday shortly after US President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA.) While stressing that Trumps decision was a historical experience for Iran, Rouhani noted that the US president has a history of undermining international treaties. Rouhani also noted that Iran would remain in the nuclear deal without the USâ€™ presence. Iran has on numerous occasions asserted that its nuclear program is merely peaceful and not meant to make nukes.
