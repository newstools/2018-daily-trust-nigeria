A Federal High Court in Abuja has foreclosed the objection of the Federal Government to the bail application by four members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Justice Binta Nyako yesterday refused the letter from the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) Abubakar Malami (SAN), which was signed by one Y. Cole requesting for an adjournment on the grounds that the office did not file a counter affidavit to the bail application by defence counsel in the matter. The judge subsequently fixed June 25 for ruling on the bail applications brought by Chidiebere Onwudiwe, Benjamin Madubugwu, David Nwawuisi and Bright Chimezie. Defence lawyers Chukwudi Igwe, P.A.N Ejiofor and Maxwel Okpara had cited health grounds for their application of the bail of their clients, which the prosecution failed to object to before the application was adjourned for ruling. The prosecution counsel, who was absent in court, told Daily Trust that bail is at the discretion of the court whether the prosecution filed an objection or not. He said what was important is for the trial to go on. The defendants, whose cases were separated from the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu (who is said to be at large) are facing three count-charges of treasonable felony of setting up illegal broadcast stations in UK and Nigeria for the secession of the South East, South South and parts of Benue and Kogi states from Nigeria. They are also charged with illegal importation of radio transmitter, and unlawful possession of firearms.
