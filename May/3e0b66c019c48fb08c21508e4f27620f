The coordinator of the Satellite Towns Development Agency (STDA), Isyaku Tanko Yamawo, has said the agency will soon revoke the Kwaita-Yebu road rehabilitation project. Yamawo, who disclosed this in an interview with our reporter on Saturday in Abuja, said the Kwaita-Yebu road project was among the STDA’s projects that were awarded to some indigenous contractors but was abandoned. He said since he assumed office as STDA coordinator, he had written series of letters to have an interface with the contractor handling the road project but the contractor had not come forward. “Yesterday, we held a meeting with my technical officers after I wrote series of letters inviting the contractor to come over to tell us what is delaying the Kwaita-Yebu road rehabilitation, which up till now we can’t locate the contractor and the next thing to do is to revoke the contract and re-award it to another competent company,” he said. He said he was impressed with the contractor handling the rehabilitation of Gwagwalada-Dobi-Izom road, which he said work was progressing on steadily. He also said the rehabilitation of Rubochi-Gwargwada-Atako road had been awarded to an indigenous construction company and that mobilization was at the stage of payment to enable the contractor commence work.
