The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) says the recruitment advertisement by the corporation currently trending on social media is false.

In a statement in Abuja on Sunday, the NNPC spokesman, Mr Ndu Ughamadu, said that the advertisement was intended to mislead innocent members of the public.

According to him, the advertisement is set in NNPC’s corporate colour with its logo.

He said that it invited candidates with background in Sciences, Engineering, Business/Finance, Social Sciences, Arts/Humanities as well as Medical/Health Sciences to apply.

"It gave required educational attainments of prospects to include: Master’s degree, Bachelor’s degree, Higher National Diploma (HND) and National Diploma.

"The advertisement is phantom. The corporation calls on unsuspecting members of the public to be wary of the scam.

"NNPC advises members of the public to disregard any announcement of recruitment or invitation to recruitment interview appearing in the social media.

“The corporation is not carrying out any recruitment exercise now,” he said.
