The Nigerian communications satellite will be used to quicken Liberia’s economic development, Liberian President, George Weah has said. A statement from Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited [NIGCOMSAT] on Tuesday quoted President Weah as saying his country would hook up with NIGCOMSAT network because it is capable of improving the lives of the ordinary citizen. Meanwhile, the Liberian Assistant Minister of Planning in the Ministry of Education, Mr. Dominic Kwenme has described NIGCOMSAT as a great asset to the African continent. Mr Kwenme stated this during the presentation of NIGCOMSAT products and services to the Ministry’s headquarters in Moronvia, Liberia recently. Mr. Kwenme, said Nigeria is driving Africa into the technological realm with the ownership of a communication satellite. He believed that despite many years of independence, Africa has not been able to push through its development stride, but now with the presence of an indigenous satellite, the ball has been set for African countries to take advantage and make the best use of it. ‘I am proud to be part of this historic meeting which is meant to drive Africa especially the underserved countries to quickly meet up with the developed world and Nigeria is doing us proud’. Earlier, the head of delegation of NIGCOMSAT Ltd, Barr. Samson Osagie, Executive Director, Marketing and Business Development, informed the Liberian President, George Mennah Weah that their mission to Liberia was informed on the need to leverage on the various services of NIGCOMSAT Ltd. The services, the Executive Director said, include e-learning, internet service provision, land administration documentation facility and a host of others.
