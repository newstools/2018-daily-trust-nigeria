A Non-governmental Organisation, Pioneers Reproductive Health and Youth Association (PREHYA) has sensitized 200 drug users against sales, consumption and violence extremism in Yobe state. The sensitization campaign carried out in Kanamma, which is the root of Boko haram insurgency, and Garin Gada in Yunusari Local government areas of the state.  Adamu Ibrahim, a senior Program Manager of the organisation said the programme was funded by North East Regional Initiatives (NERI) to reduce the danger of drugs abuse among youth in the two communities.  "If the youth are more aware of how substances abuse make them vulnerable, It would prevent that appeal for youth joining violent extremist groups" he said.  He noted that the campaign strategy they had adopted would make the drug users less interested in the substances and more willing to stand against its sales in their communities.  The programme was marked by weeks of Advocacy visits, foot ball competition and community rally on “Say no to drugs” in both communities.
