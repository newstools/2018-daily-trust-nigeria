Arsenal boss Unai Emery wants to bring Ousmane Dembele to the Emirates - and Barcelona are reportedly willing to sell. Emery was announced as Arsene Wenger’s successor this week after months of speculation over who would replace the Frenchman at Arsenal. The former PSG boss, who was axed and replaced by Thomas Tuchel, is thought to have a £50m transfer budget this summer. However, reports have claimed a further £20m is available to Emery to bolster his squad in north London. And according to Spanish news outlet Don Balon, Emery has told Arsenal chiefs to sign Barcelona star Dembele this summer. They say the ex-PSG manager feels Dembele, 21, would be the ideal signing. And with the Gunners not being able to afford the former Borussia Dortmund forward, Don Balon say Barca are willing to agree a loan deal with Arsenal. The Spanish giants are keen on a temporary deal which includes an option to buy next summer.
