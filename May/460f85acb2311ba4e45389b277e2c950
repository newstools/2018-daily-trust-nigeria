A 72-year-old farmer, Audu Bizo,  has been docked before a Grade 1 Area Court, Kubwa, over alleged forgery of military discharge certificate. The defendant, who hails from Katsina State, was docked on charges bordering on using as genuine, a forged document and cheating. Bizo, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor, John Okpa, told the court that the defendant, at the Military Pensions Board, Abuja, presented a forged discharge certificate as genuine, on May 22. He said the defendant did so to draw pension from government through the Nigeria Military Pensions Board, which he was not entitled to. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 366 and 322 of the penal code. The judge, Mohammed Marafa, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N300,000 with two sureties in like sum, who must also reside within the court’s jurisdiction. He adjourned the case until June 11 for hearing. (NAN)
