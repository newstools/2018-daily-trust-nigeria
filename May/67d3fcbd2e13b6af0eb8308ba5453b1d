The Registrar of Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Professor Is-haq Oloyede has lamented that Nigeria was ruled by certified thieves and that corruption remains the bane of development of the nation.

He said this in Osogbo, Osun State at a colloquium organised to mark the 61st birthday of the Governor of Osun State, Mr Rauf Aregbesola tagged 'Raufnomics in the transformation of Osun'.

Speaking on the theme "Functional Education as a tool for National Development and a Gateway to Freedom", Oloyede said all citizens must support the fight against corruption before there could be meaningful progress and development in all sectors including the education.

Oloyede decried the level of corruption in the country before the administration of President Muhammad Buhari. "Since the inception of JAMB, the total money remitted was 52 million. After the first examination when I became JAMB Registrar, we made 9billion and we remitted 7.8billion to the federal government."

"Before we came, they were remitting between 2 and 3 million after JAMB examination. On the last examination, we already have 9billion to remit. That is just one sector and the situation is the same all over the places across all sectors," he said.
