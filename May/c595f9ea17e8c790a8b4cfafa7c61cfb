Hundreds of women on Monday protest on the streets of Lagos against killings in some parts of Nigeria. The protest tagged: ‘National Day of mourning’ was organized by the Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC) and other Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) with the support of MacArthur Foundation. Clad in black T-shirt, the women including Muslims, Christians and traditionalists walked from the Airport Hotel to the popular Allen Roundabout along the Obafemi Awolowo road in Ikeja, rendering dirge to mourn those who died in various killings across the country. Detailing several killings in states like Borno, Zamfara, Benue, Adamawa, Plateau, Nasarrawa, Taraba, Kaduna, Rivers, Akwa-Ibom, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos and Edo state, they urged the government to take decisive actions to bring the killers to justice. The mourners said more women have lost their lives in the killings by Boko Haram insurgents, killer-herdsmen, bandits as well as many deaths of women occasioned by poor maternal care. Some of the placards displayed by the protesters as inscriptions such as: "We condemn all killings in any form"; "Stop these deaths, maternal mortality ratio, 576 deaths to 100,000 live births"; " Everyday, 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and child birth", among others.
