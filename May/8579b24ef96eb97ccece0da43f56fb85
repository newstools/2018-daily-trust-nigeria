The Akida Group in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna State has said its members may be compelled to leave the APC if their grievances are not met. The group in a statement signed by its Executive Chairman, Mataimaki Tom Maiyashi, said it had informed all relevant party organs and leaders that it would consider leaving the party if there was no visible evidence of success in addressing the damaging levels of alienation and frustration among the millions of party faithful in Kaduna State. It pointed out that the recent congress of the party in the state as well as the local government elections showed that the party was fast losing its popularity due to exclusion of other members. “We appeal to anyone with authority or influence over the governor to use it responsibly to head off a looming disaster in the shape of a party that has lost its foundations and its future,” the statement added.
