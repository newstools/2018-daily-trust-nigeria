The Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) has called on the Federal government to take proactive measures to curb incessant killings and communal crises in the country. President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Abubakar Balarabe Mahmoud, made the call on Thursday at opening ceremony of the 2018 NBA National Excutive Meeting holding in Kano. Mahmoud said NBA was also concern on the prevailing rancour between the National Assembly and the Executive arm of government which resulted into delay in passage of the 2018 budget. He said, "NBA has condemned incesssant killings in Adamawa, Taraba, Zamfara and Benue states. The country is gradually drifting into a state of anarchy. "We are deeply worried with the increasing cases of armed bandits and herdsmen attacks, leading to violence and loss of lives across the country. The killings in Adamawa, Zamfara, Benue speak more of the absence or near absence of state institutions in those areas. "NBA is calling on the Federal and states governments to rise to the challenges to tackle the crimes and criminality in the country. The government must take proactive measures rather than reactive." The NBA president expressed concerns over President Muhammadu Buhari's refusal to approve recommendations of the NationalÂ  Judiciary Commission on appointment of Judges of the Court of Appeal and other critical appointments. Mahmoud decried lack of synergy among agencies of governments, a development he said has led to failure in performance of government business. On the 2019 general elections, the NBA president cautioned INEC, security agencies and all stakeholders to maintain their constitutional responsibilities and avoid being partisan.
