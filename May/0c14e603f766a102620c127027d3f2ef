Thirteen people have died after a clash between suspected armed bandits and vigilantes in Fankashi village in Maru local government area of Zamfara state. The attack came barely three weeks after 27 people were killed in a deadly raid on Kabaro village in Dansadau district of Maru local government area of the state. The spokesman of the state police, DSP Muhammad Shehu, told Daily Trust that some residents of the Fankashi community had earlier intercepted and unlawfully executed two suspected armed bandits. He said some days later, the vigilantes gathered in a forest near Fankashi, a village located 20 km north of Dansadau town to hold a meeting on how to deal with the threat by the armed bandits in the area. "But when the armed bandits learnt that the vigilantes were holding a meeting in the forest, they stormed the area on motorbikes firing at everything at sight, in what appeared to be a pre-emptive attack." "However, the local vigilantes resisted them and fought back resulting in the death of 13 people from both sides," he added. DSP Shehu further explained that security operatives had cordoned the area and investigation had commenced adding that the law would take its cause. However, a resident of the area, Babangida Halilu, told Daily Trust that the attack was triggered after some residents of the community had taken over farmlands belonging to some suspected armed bandits. "The armed bandits raided the village and carted away camels belonging to the residents. They later placed ransom on the siezed camels but the residents refused to give in to their demands and later decided to attack the community," he said.
