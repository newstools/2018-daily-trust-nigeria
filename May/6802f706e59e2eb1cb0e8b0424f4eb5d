The Nigerian Armed Forces are synergizing in an exercise code named “Ex Oju Ogun-Le” to test how effective contingency plans are at tackling the menace. Personnel of the Services including the Nigerian Navy, Nigeria Air Force and the Nigerian Army are being subjected to the use of networked computers which will interface to real time situations at the Armed Forces Simulation Centre, Jaji, Kaduna. The 1st edition of the Defence Headquarters Contingency Plan Simulation Exercise for the Services is organized by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Abayomi Olonishaki. He said the prevailing security situation in the country is characterized by continued attacks, reprisal and retaliatory act between farmers and herdsmen, banditry, cattle rustling, wanton killings as well as pipeline vandalism and oil theft. Represented by the Director, Campaign Planning, DHQ, Major General Augustine Agundu, the CDS pointed out that combating these menaces need careful planning and evaluation through continuous and qualitative training. Earlier in his remarks, Director, Armed Forces Simulation Centre (AFSC), Major General Julius Oni, said it is hoped that at the end of the six-day simulation exercise which will end on 12th May, 2018, the commandants and staff of the three services will be exposed to the planning, preparation and execution of Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW).
