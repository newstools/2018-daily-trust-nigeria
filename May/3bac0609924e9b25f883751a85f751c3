The US may allow private companies to invest in North Korea, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday. In an interview on Fox News, he clarified that this would be conditional on the country’s full denuclearisation. He said US investors could help build its energy grid. This comes after his trip to Pyongyang last week and ahead of President Donald Trump’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The US announced its offer to help rebuild the North Korean economy on Friday, but Mr Pompeo has now given more details on the proposal. “This will be Americans coming in - private sector Americans, not the US taxpayer - private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea,” he said.
