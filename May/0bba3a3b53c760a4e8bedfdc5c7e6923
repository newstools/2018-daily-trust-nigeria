The Federation of International Women Lawyers (FIDA) has donated relief materials, include clothing and toiletries, to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from several communities affected by communal clashes and gunmen attacks in Daffo District of Bokkos Local Government of Area of Plateau State. FIDA Chairperson in the state, Mary Abah, said during the donation that the core mandate of the organisation is to render humanitarian services to women and children who are most vulnerable during crises situations, and that the organisation stands for peace, unity and mutual respect. She said it was sad that many vulnerable women and children were killed on daily basis in attacks and clashes across the country, adding that in this respect the organisationâ€™s 32 branches across the country will endeavour to rise to the occasion and assist the vulnerable. Reacting, a community leader of Daffo, who received the materials on behalf of the victims, John Danjuma, pledged judicious distribution of the materials to the affected persons.
