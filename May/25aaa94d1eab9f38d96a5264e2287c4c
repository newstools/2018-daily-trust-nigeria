The latest round of peace talks for South Sudan has ended without a deal being reached. The East African regional body, Igad, had proposed a power sharing agreement with three new positions of vice president - one going to the exiled rebel leader, Riek Machar. Mabior Garang, a member of the rebel forces known as the SPLA-IO, said the proposed deal was unfair as it maintained the status quo with power mainly in the governmentâ€™s hands. Since President Salva Kiir and Mr Machar, his former vice-president, fell out almost five years ago, more than four million people have been displaced by conflict in South Sudan and thousands have been killed.
