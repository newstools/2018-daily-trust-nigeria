A rainstorm on Wednesday wreaked havoc in Kaduna, killing two people at Ungwar Sarki in Kaduna North and Narayi in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. Daily Trust gathered yesterday that an eight-year old boy whose name was given as Baba, was trying to fetch water outside his house when a tree fell on him and killed him. At Narayi, a man whose identity was yet to be known by press time was said to have died after an electric pole fell on him, breaking his head. In addition to lives lost, the wind blew off the roof of many houses and business premises, destroyed billboards and uprooted trees and electric poles. The Executive Secretary of Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Ben Kure, said he had not received any official report but advised residents to desist from moving around under heavy winds. “Don’t take shelter under a tree or electric pole because some of them are not properly planted or installed as the case may be,” he said.
