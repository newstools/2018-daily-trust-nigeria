Secretary General, Jama'atul Nasir Islam (JNI), Dr Khalid Abubakar Aliyu has said that banning the production and consumption of abused drugs such as codeine without punitive measures is not enough.  Speaking with journalists shortly after the JNI annual pre- Ramadan meeting in Kaduna, the Dr. Khalid said the Federal government must move beyond banning of abused drugs to set aside laws and punitive measures to tackle the menace.  He said, “There should be a law or sanction on whoever is found producing these drugs and should be punishable with 10 years prison term without option of bail to serve as a deterrent to others.  Dr. Aliyu said the participants of the meeting unanimously agreed that drug addiction is one of the most dangerous problems ravaging the country.  He expressed shock over the startling revelation that three million bottles of codeine are consumed in Jigawa and Kano states.  Chairman, Etiquette Committee  for Tafsir, Sheikh Tijani Umaru cautioned clerics to beware of their utterances during sermons, explaining that the Boko Haram menace became humongous as a result of negative sermons propagated by false preachers.
