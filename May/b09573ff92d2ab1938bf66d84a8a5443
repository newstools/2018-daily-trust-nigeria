The Lagos State police command said it has smashed a syndicate that specialized in smuggling drugs into the country through the waterways. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who confirmed the arrest, said weeds suspected to be Indian hemp valued at over N10 million was recovered from the gang. Edgal said that drug traffickers have resorted to the use of the waterways to smuggle psychotropic substances since it has become increasingly difficult to do so by road. Edgal stated that on May 4, 2018, the Divisional Police Officer of Osolu Kingdom and his team intercepted 18 bales of substances suspected to be cannabis on the Ajidun waterways and cash of N250,000. The police boss said that one of the suspects, Mr Segun Bashiru, was arrested and the two boats which they used in ferrying the illicit drugs seized and kept as exhibits at the command.
