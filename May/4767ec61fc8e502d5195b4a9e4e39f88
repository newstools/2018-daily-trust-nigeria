The Emir of Hadejia, Adamu Abubakar Maje, has appealed to the Federal Government to establish a higher institution of learning, rehabilitate Gaya/Hadejia/Katagum road and inclusion of the emirate in the proposed railway lines in the country. The emir made the appeal yesterday when President Muhammadu Buhari visited his palace as part of his two-day visit in Jigawa State. He said his emirate had no higher institution of learning and called on Mr. President to establish one for them. The monarch noted that the Gaya/Hadejia/Katungum road was built in 1985 when the president was the military Head of State and that since then the road has suffered series of neglect, hence the level of deterioration of the road. Maje, who appealed for the extension of the construction of railway line to Hadejia, said his emirate was blessed with businessmen and endowed with agricultural potentials. “I am appealing to Mr. President to provide the Hadejia Emirate with a higher institution of learning and rehabilitate the Gaya/Hadejia/Katagum road. The road which is in deplorable condition was built by president Buhari when he was the Military Head of state in 1985. Since then the road has never gotten a face lift.” In his response, President Buhari told the emir that his government would look into his request and also thanked the people of Hadejia for their support.
