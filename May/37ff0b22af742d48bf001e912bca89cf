Senator Dino Melaye was yesterday arraigned by the Nigeria Police before a Chief Magistrate Court in Wuse Zone 2, Abuja on allegation of attempting to escape from justice. The First Information Report (FIR) by the police alleged that Melaye attempted to escape from lawful custody. Melaye, who arrived the court on a stretcher, was however rearrested on other pending allegations after he fulfilled the terms of his bail. Magistrate Mabel Bello granted him bail in the sum of N90 million and two sureties. The magistrate ordered that one of the sureties must be a civil servant on Grade Level 14 and must show evidence of his residence in FCT. The lawmaker was ordered to deposit his international passport with the Commissioner of Police, FCT Command and to report himself to the Wuse Zone 2 Police station every first working day of the week. The police FIR accused Melaye of breaking the windscreen of police vehicle conveying him to Lokoja, Kogi State to face criminal charges, and threatening to commit suicide. The case was adjourned to June 6 for trial. The lawmaker was however re-arrested after fulfilling the bail conditions. He is said to have also been discharged from hospital. Melaye, who is the senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District, was earlier declared wanted by the police on allegations of gun running. He was hospitalized after he fell from the vehicle conveying him to Lokoja. Meanwhile, an FCT High Court in Apo presided by Justice Olusegun Adeniyi had on Wednesday granted Senator Melaye bail in the sum of N50m and directed he be released from police custody.
