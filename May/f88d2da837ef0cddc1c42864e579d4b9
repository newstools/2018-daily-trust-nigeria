A human rights activist and lawyer, Mr. Morakinyo Ogele has demanded from Governor Ayo Fayose the total amount that had accrued to the state from the federation account since he came to power in 2014. 

The lawyer said he was relying on the Freedom of Information Law and pursuant to Sections 1(1) (2) (3) (V) e (1) 3 (1) of the Ekiti State Freedom of Information Law 2011. 

Ogele made the demand in a letter to Fayose, a copy of which was made available to journalists in Ado Ekiti on Thursday where he also challenged the governor to reveal how the allocation had been spent between October 2014 and April 2018.

Other demands from Ogele are the total allocation that went to the office of the Deputy Governor who is also the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the July 14 governorship election, Prof. Kolapo Olusola.

He said revelation from the governor would enable him to write the Deputy Governor to inquire how statutory funds allocated to his office had been spent.

Ogele, who is also the National Coordinator of Ekiti Redemption Group (ERG), warned that failure to supply the information within seven days of receipt of the letter could warrant litigation and invitation from the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC).

He also demanded the total amount spent on the construction of the Ado-Ekiti Flyover which was commissioned last Friday by former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Ogele equally demanded an explanation from Fayose on how N20 billion released to the Ekiti State government by the Goodluck Jonathan administration was disbursed.

Other demands in the letter by Ogele to the governor include how the ecological funds were utilized for the benefit of the people, allocations to the local government and their disbursement.

The lawyer also wanted to know how much was spent on stomach infrastructure and the amount spent on the aborted Ado-Ekiti Airport project.
