The Chairman, Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debt,Senator Shehu Sani has reacted to the former governor of Taraba State, Jolly Nyame's judgement. Nyame was found guilty on 27 of the charges and sentenced to 14 years in prison without option of a fine by Justice Adebukola Banjoko of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Sani in a tweet on Thursday said,"Men who fell from grace, and now  facing the consequences of their conduct while in office,once held the arrogant belief prevalent in the psyche of the Men in power today, that it will never happen to them but to others. "A leader or leaders raised to an infallible status by those who love them,loses the privilege of grace accorded to mortals and the waiver of human imperfections from those who will assess or score them".
