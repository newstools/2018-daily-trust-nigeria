A House of Representatives aspirant for Abuja South constituency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ahmad Abubakar Sadiq, has said he had released money for payment of school fees of 80 orphans who are secondary school students in the constituency. Abubakar, who was speaking with newsmen on Saturday, shortly after he held a meeting with the party ward secretaries from Abaji, Kwali, Gwagwalada and Kuje, saidÂ  the gesture was to help keep the students in school as some of them could drop out because of lack of school fees. He said there were many orphans who were blessed with intelligence but had no financial support to go to school to acquire knowledge. The aspirant said that was what prompted him to direct the party ward secretaries in the four area councils to present 80 orphans so he could pay their school fees.
