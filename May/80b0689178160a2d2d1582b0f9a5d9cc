The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) was not established by the Federal Government to either waste or steal money, the Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, has said. He said though the board was not meant to generate money for the federal government it should not steal unspent money. Oloyede said this in Benin yesterday while reacting to insinuations that JAMB has turned into a money making machine for the government. Oloyede, who was in Benin on the proposed plan of the body to partner other security agencies in the conduct of their examinations, said JAMB under his watch has been able to manage its resources and return the leftover instead of embarking on wastefulness. “If after spending capital and overhead and still has surplus of billions, do people want us to waste the billions or steal it? That is why I am surprised that people are making noise that we are generating money. If you say we are increasing the charges I can understand but we are not doing so”, he said. Oloyede said when he assumed office the first thing he did was that government should not give us capital vote again, adding that the board stopped collecting capital vote and overhead from government in the last two years.
