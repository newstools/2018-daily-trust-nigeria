A mother of four, Funmilayo Olanrewaju, on Tuesday told a customary court sitting in Ile-Tuntun, Mapo, Ibadan, that her husband, Olatunji Olanrewaju, usually subjects her to punishment whenever he wins a new contract. Funmilayo alleged that with four children in the marriage, the family’s feeding allowance was N200 for three weeks and N500 for six weeks. Her husband, Olanrewaju, had approached the court praying for the dissolution of the 24-year-old marriage. Funmilayo, however, argued she should have been the partner to ask that the marriage be ended but had kept calm for the sake of their children. Maintaining why the marriage should be dissolved, Olanrewaju said, “I am tired of her disrespect and non- cooperation towards the upbringing of our children. Whenever we have an argument in the house, she will keep my phone away from me, knowing my phone is my office. Even when peacemakers intervene to release the phone, she won’t listen.” Funmilayo, who appealed to the court not to end the marriage “because of the children”, said, “At the beginning of our life as a couple, he had nothing, I had to borrow N150,000 from a friend for him to get a generator. I had to repay the loan after my husband refused to pay back. I also helped him to borrow money from the cooperative and the loan remains N40,000 to be paid. “It is true that I took his phone so that he could give us money for feeding because whenever I asked him for money, he would claim he didn’t have any.” The president of the court, Chief Henry Agbaje, adjourned the suit till June 11, 2018 for further hearing.
