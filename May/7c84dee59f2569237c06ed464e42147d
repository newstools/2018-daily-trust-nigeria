Rainstorm has destroyed property worth millions of naira in the Aisegba and Agbado-Ekiti communities of the Gbonyin Local Government Area of Ekiti State. The damaged property, according to a statement yesterday by the stateâ€™s Ministry of Information, included the palace of the traditional ruler of Aisegba and almost 60 other buildings in the community and about 40 houses in Agbado, which roofs were blown off. Conducting the General Manager of the State Emergency Management Agency, Mr Jide Borode, round for an on-the-spot assessment of the affected areas, the Apalufin of Aisegba, Oba Solomon Omotoyinbo, solicited the assistance of the state government, as well as that of public-spirited individuals and corporate organisations towards renovating the affected buildings. Oba Omotoyinbo stressed the importance of the old palace to the community, emphasising that the building remained a historical object that must be preserved for future generation. The Regent of Agbado Ekiti, Mrs Okunbobade Oke, lamented that the rainstorm rendered many residents of the town homeless.
