A Kogi State High Court sitting in Lokoja yesterday ordered that Senator Dino Melaye, who represents Kogi West, be moved to the National Hospital, Abuja to continue his treatment while under the custody of the police. The Kogi State Chief Judge, Justice Nasiru Ajanah, who presided over the court proceedings, gave the order when the counsel to Melaye, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), approached the court to present a written bail application for the senator. Justice Ajanah also adjourned till Monday, May 7, for continuation of hearing in a written bail application filed by Ozekhome, asking for a variation of the remand order placed on him. This followed the refusal to grant Dino bail Melaye on Thursday when he was arraigned before a Senior Magistrateâ€™s Court in Lokoja on a seven counts charge bordering on criminal conspiracy and illegal possession of fire arms. Justice Ajanah said in view of the critical health condition as made known by the counsel to the applicant, he should be moved to the National Hospital, Abuja, for proper medical attention. Earlier, Ozekhome had argued that the lawmaker was a chronic asthmatic patient, and had to be given his special inhaler in the presence of the trial Magistrate, Sulyman Abdalah..
