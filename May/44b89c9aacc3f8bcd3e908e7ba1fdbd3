US President Donald Trump has done little to quell mounting uncertainty surrounding a hallmark meeting with North Korea’s leader planned for next month, as he held key talks with his South Korean counterpart at the White House. Trump is scheduled to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12, but in recent weeks concerns have been raised over whether the summit will take place amid disagreements over denuclearisation in the Korean peninsula. “If it doesn’t happen, maybe it will happen later,” Trump said of the meeting, addressing reporters alongside Moon Jae-in. “It may not work out for June 12.” But Trump, who earlier this month withdrew the US from a multinational nuclear deal with Iran, muddied waters even further. Saying that despite Kim being “serious” about denuclearisation, there was a “substantial chance” the Singapore summit would not take place at all, unless “certain conditions” were met by North Korea.
