Former president Olusegun Obasanjo said without modern method such as biotechnology in agriculture, global efforts at ending hunger will remain a mirage. Obasanjo, who disclosed this at the South West Sensitization programme of the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB), which held at Abeokuta, Ogun State, said Nigeria needs biotech to feed its teaming population, according to a statement from OFAB yesterday. “World’s population is estimated to reach about 9.7 billion by 2050. If agricultural yields stay the same, we would need to cultivate more than double the present amount of land to feed that population. That’s 82% of our total land area on earth”, the former president said. He said biotechnology was taking mankind beyond the depths of understanding of chemical and physical possibilities. “It has the potential to increase agricultural productivity, enhance food security, develop a better health care delivery system, boost an efficient industrial development process for transforming raw materials and detoxifying hazardous wastes, reduce mortality rates, move agriculture away from a dependence on chemical inputs and help to reduce environmental problems’’, he said. Mr Oguntunde Abayomi, the overseeing Director General of National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), said the event was timely and pertinent especially at this period that Nigeria and other African countries are adopting improved agricultural technologies for food security. In a presentation, Dr Rose Gidado, OFAB Country Coordinator highlighted why biotechnology has kept the promise of achieving food security across the world.
