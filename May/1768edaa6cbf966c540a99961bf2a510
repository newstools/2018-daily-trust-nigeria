Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga has told his supporters to end a campaign of boycotting products and businesses allegedly linked to the ruling Jubilee Party and President Uhuru Kenyatta, months after he called for a nationwide boycott. Safaricom, the country’s biggest telecom company and Brookside, a top dairy processing firm were among those targeted.  Mr Odinga made the comments at May Day celebrations in the capital, Nairobi. “Today we are ordering our members to end the boycott of Safaricom, Bidco, Haco and Brookside,” he said. Some of the companies were also targeted over their alleged collusion with the ruling party to deny Mr Odinga a victory in last year’s election. In March the veteran leader called a truce with President Kenyatta and the two leaders are currently working together to “build bridges”.
