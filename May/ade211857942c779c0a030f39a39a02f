The Kwali Area Council chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), yesterday, held its annual peace and security conference. The conference was held at Kwali town hall with the theme ‘Peace, Security and Sustainable Development in Nigeria’. In his speech, the Kwali CAN chairman, Rev. Dominic Abraham, said the annual conference was aimed at fostering the virtue of fear of God, development, peaceful coexistence as well as mutual respect and understanding among residents of the area. He said the conference would shape the citizens’ collective aspirations of what Nigeria was, so that they would be adaptable to the necessary change to build a prosperous future. “We have so many prevalent security issues across the country, which we decided to call our members together to rub minds on how to address them,” he said. He added, “And what we intend to achieve at the end of this conference is to prepare ourselves for future elections and also to tell ourselves to do the right thing.” Also speaking, the former chairman of the council, Ibrahim Daniel, said it has become paramount for Christians to come together to talk to themselves on what was happening not only in the council but across the country. He said the conference was coming at the right time so that the people can be reawakened on the need to enthrone peace, adding that a society where there was no peace, there would hardly be any development.
