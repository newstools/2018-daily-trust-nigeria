The wife of the senator representing the FCT, Mrs. Hauwa Philip Aduda, on Sunday donated foodstuff to lepers of Alheri special village at Yangoji, Kwali Area Council. Mrs Aduda, while presenting bags of rice, beans, salt, millet and sugar, said the gesture was to assist the lepers with the food items to reduce the hardship they were facing in the Ramadan fasting. She said the presentation of the food items to the lepers was part of effort to bring succour to the less privileged in the society. She assured them that she would discuss some of their challenges with her husband so that he could assist them. The chief of lepers of the special village, Isah Ali, while receiving the food items on their behalf, commended the senator’s wife for identifying with them and donating food items to them for the Ramadan fasting. He noted that the lepers in the village had over the years been receiving gifts and other assistance from the late mother of Senator Aduda, whom he said always visited the village when she was alive. He therefore appealed to the senator’s wife to channel their challenges to the authorities, especially payment of their monthly stipend that had been stopped by the FCT Administration since former president Olusegun Obasanjo left office. “We want to appeal to you to help us pass our complaint to your husband to help us inform the FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, about our monthly stipends which we stopped receiving since Obasanjo left,” he said. The chief also requested for construction of a shade within the village to enable them have a place they can rest and take fresh air.
