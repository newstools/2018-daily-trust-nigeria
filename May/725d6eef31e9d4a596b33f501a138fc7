Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been released from detention after he was arrested amid widespread protests against President Vladimir Putin. Navalny was detained in Moscow where he was attending a demonstration organised by him against the inauguration of the Russian president. Navalny, who has been jailed in the past for organising unauthorised rallies, had called for people critical of Putin’s leadership to take to the streets in advance of the president’s inauguration for a fourth term on Monday.
