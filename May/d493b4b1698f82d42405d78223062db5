National President, Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), ComradeIbrahim Khalil has revealed that only 12 out of 36 state House of Assemblies have decided on local government autonomy bill as majority of the states have allowed the bill to hang with the pretext of organising a public hearing. The President made this known in Kano state during a press briefing, according to him it is also disturbing to notice that a matter of human importance has been put aside by most of the state’s assembly for no concreate reason. He added that state’s house of assemblies in the 25 states are yet to decide on the bill, while 12 have already done what they were supposed to have done. “It will interest you to know that out of the 36 states only 12 states have taken a stand on the local government autonomy bill in which 3 states house of assemblies voted against the bill and 9 voted in support of the bill while 25 states are still lagging behind under all sort of pretext. For instance in Kano state the situation is worrisome because the bill is still hanging under the pretext of organizing public hearing, but in the recent crisis in Kano state house of assembly a vital information about LG’s autonomy leaked out where members and the leadership treaded blames, ” said Khalil. He added that, NULGE leadership and that of other organised labour bodies have resolved to call on all eligible voters to vote out those who went against the local government autonomy bill. “They have the people’s mandate and they have decided to go against the people’s desire. NULGE and other organised labour bodies have decided to call on all voters not to vote for those who went against the autonomy bill come 2019,” he revealed.
