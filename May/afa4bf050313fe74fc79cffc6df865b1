The National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) has expressed displeasure with the Federal Government’s handling of the ongoing Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) strike. President of the association, Abdurafiu Adeniyi, stated this at the weekend, while briefing newsmen as part of activities to commemorate this year’s Nurses and Midwives week in Abuja. He said rather than implementing agreements entered with JOHESU and obeying court orders, the federal ministry of health has chosen to employ draconian measures aimed at frustrating their members. “Such measures include churning out outrageous circulars and intimidating our members with law enforcement agencies and peddling half truth and pure falsehood in blackmailing our members. The federal government need to take the path of honour by implementing the agreement they have signed with the JOHESU,” Adeniyi said.
