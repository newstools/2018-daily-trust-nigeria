Three United Nations agencies have written to Sudan’s President Omal al-Bashir to urge him to pardon a 19-year-old woman who was sentenced to death for killing her husband. Noura Hussein killed her husband after he allegedly raped her as his male relatives restrained her. It prompted UN Women, UN Population Fund and UN office of the special adviser on Africa to pen a joint statement, “speaking as the voices of women and girls of the world”, to “plead with the government of Sudan to save the life of Hussein”.
