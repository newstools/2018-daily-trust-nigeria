The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has inaugurated a Contact Committee saddled with the responsibility to open talks with other political parties ahead of the 2019 general elections. The party said the committee led by a former governor of Cross River State Liyel Imoke, will discuss with like-minds that are ready to join forces with the PDP to push out the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2019. Inaugurating the committee on Friday in Abuja, PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, said the party would do everything legitimately possible to return to power. “Your committee and your nomination into it is a well-articulated decision of the party leadership to bring our open door policy to fruition,” he said. Former governors of Jigawa, Sule Lamido, Babangida Aliyu (Niger) and Gabriel Suswam (Benue), former Director-General of NAFDAC, Dr Paul Orhii, former ministers Kema Chikwe (Aviation) and Haliru Bello (Defence) are members of the committee.
