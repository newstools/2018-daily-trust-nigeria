A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, has sentenced a 30-year-old wheel barrow pusher, Musa Salisu, to one month imprisonment for stealing two barrow tyres. The judge, Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq, however gave the convict an option of N3,000 fine. Salisu, of Berger under bridge, Abuja, had pleaded guilty of theft and begged the court to temper justice with mercy. He said “I did not know what came over me. I am sorry.” The prosecutor, Ifeoma Ukahga, had told the court that the matter was reported by Williams Onyeakazi of Karmo, Abuja, at Karmo Police Station on May 15. She said the convict, being a wheel barrow pusher, went to Onyeakazi’s shop and pretended to rent a wheel barrow. Ukahga said Salisu dishonestly stole two wheel barrow tyres valued at N6,000. She added that Salisu had confessed to the crime during police investigation and the tyres recovered from him. She said the offence contravened Section 288 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
