The Akwa Ibom State governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, has cautioned politicians in the state against causing disunity and rancour. He told politicians to remember that, outside politics, they are all brothers and sisters from the same stock. Speaking yesterday in Uyo during his democracy day broadcast to mark his third year in office, the governor said he will continue to promote brotherliness, love and unity in line with the essence and definition of the Akwa Ibom spirit. “As the political season dawns, let us remember that we were brothers and sisters before the coming of partisan politics, and we will remain brothers and sisters long after we had finished our careers in public service,” he said. Emmanuel listed his achievements in three years to include the construction of 1,701 kilometres of roads and 35 bridges, construction of three injector stations to complement the Ibom Power Plant, the Syringe Manufacturing Factory, Electric Digital Metering Solutions Manufacturing Factory and the Pencil and Toothpick factory. Others are: the resuscitation of the Peacock Paint Industry, the Plastic Manufacturing Factory, the Fertilizer Blending Factory and Rice Processing Mill which are ready for commissioning.
