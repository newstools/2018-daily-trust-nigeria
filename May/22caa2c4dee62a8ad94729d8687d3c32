After a verification exercise conducted on 13,000 health workers in Sokoto State, 6000 of them were discovered to be ghost workers, Governor Aminu Tambuwal said. He stated this at the inauguration ofÂ  the Primary Healthcare Centre, Gagi and Birthright Labour Room. Tambuwal however disclosed plans to recruit 400 health workers to boost healthcare services in the state. He expressed commitment of the Sokoto State government towards improving maternal care and routine immunization. According to him, recent survey indicated that the state had recorded 43 per cent improvement on routine immunization. The governor said the contributory health care scheme which was recently introduced in the state was meant to ensure universal health coverage for the people of the state. In his remarks, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Balarabe Kakale, said the idea of customized labour room was based on the fact that majority of women in rural areas do not go to the hospital for delivery.
