The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has flayed the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ibrahim Idris for snubbing Senate invitations on three different occasions over the worsening security situation in the country. The PDP in a statement yesterday, by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the IGP’s action was a deliberate assault on the nation’s democratic process. The party urged the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki and other senators to protect the institution of the legislature and democracy. “It is instructive to state that never in our democratic history as a people and a nation, has a service chief or an inspector general of police treated the National Assembly with as much dishonour and disdain like the current IGP. “All over the world, the legislature is a bastion of democracy and our Constitution, in recognition of this, provides a special place for our National Assembly, as the representatives of the people, to serve as a check on the Executive arm. “We therefore condemn this offensive on our democracy by IGP Idris as well as the deliberate insult being heaped on each of our legislators by appointees of President Buhari,” the PDP said.
