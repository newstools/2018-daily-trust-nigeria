Gunmen killed about 30 persons in an attack on Malikawa village of Gidan Goga district in Maradun Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Daily Trust on Sunday gathered. Following yesterday’s attack, the death toll from such raids on rural communities in the state from February till date has hit 189. Residents told Daily Trust on Sunday that the gunmen earlier attacked and killed five persons who had gone to work on their farms. A resident identified as Mallam Makau said the attackers refused to allow the residents to bury the victims by attacking those who attended the funeral procession. However, they were able to hold funeral prayers for the victims after a contingent of soldiers arrived the community. “In the early hours of the morning, five residents who had gone to plant seeds on their farmlands were shot dead by the armed bandits hiding in a forest near our community. When people of the area went to get the corpses for burial, the gunmen started shooting sporadically and they killed about 25 persons,” Makau said. The spokesman of the state police command, DSP Muhammad Shehu, said the attack was a result of land dispute between two warring factions. He added that security operatives had been despatched to the area to restore law and order.
