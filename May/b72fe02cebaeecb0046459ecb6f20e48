Communities  in the Lake Chad Basin are complaining of misconducts of security  personnel deployed to fight insurgency in the area.

They alleged that the soldiers were eloping with girls and young women from the communities.

This  was contained in a report released by the United Nations Development  Programme (UNDP) on Tuesday titled "Perspectives from local communities  on stabilization and building peace in the Lake Chad Basin". 

The  report said a lack of professionalism of security forces and their  alleged misconduct was cited severally, reportedly resulting in  insufficient trust between security forces and the communities.

"In  Cameroon, relations between security agencies and communities seemed  particularly strained by sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by  members of the security agencies.

"In  Limani, for example, a woman gave birth to a child that was fathered by  a soldier, resulting to her being excluded from her home due to the  taboos associated with this incident," the report stated.

It  was also discovered that "other girls and young women in the area have  left villages with soldiers without undertaking the traditional or civil  marriage process."

More so, the report said communities were accusing security forces of harassment and extortion at check points and borders.

The UNDP said all these were aggravating community sentiments against security forces.

The  report however, noted that despite the mistrust that existed between  the communities and the security, there were calls for deployment of  more troops and security forces in the area.

It  therefore, called for efforts to sustain well-trained and equipped  military and security presence, adding that security operatives must  also be made to adhere to a code of conduct.
