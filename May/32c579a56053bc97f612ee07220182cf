The Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari not to address Nigerians on the occasion of the 2018 Democracy Day on Tuesday.

The party â€Žin a statement Sunday night by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the government had violated all tenets of democracy, trampled on citizens' rights and should not be associated with democracy under any guise whatsoever.

The PDP noted that Nigerians had become frustrated and despondent by the magnitude of lies and deception told by the Buhari Presidency and the APC and would prefer to spend the next twelve months contending with such past deceptions than fresh falsification.

"Indeed, this administration should not come close to the emblem of democracy, as such would be an unpardonable spat on the faces of millions of suppressed Nigerians and the graves of victims of extra-judicial executions under this administration, as catalogued by international bodies including, Transparency International (TI), Amnesty International (AI) and even the United States Department of State.

"Instead of celebrating Democracy, Nigerians are today groaning in regret for electing an administration that has completely turned against them, engaging in clampdown with utmost impunity, setting aside our constitutional provisions and desecrating all democratic established institutions."
