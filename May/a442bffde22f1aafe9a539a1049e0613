Okon said that the gallant troops repelled the insurgents’ attack on a military base in the area on May 2. He disclosed that the insurgents torched a vehicle, but that there were no casualties. “Yesterday at about 6:45 p.m., suspected Boko Haram terrorists attempted to attack a military location at Auno village on Maiduguri-Damaturu Highway. “They were promptly repelled by troops; apart from a Peugeot J5 vehicle which was burnt by the terrorists, no life was lost in the attack and normalcy has been restored to the village,” he said. Okon added that military and police reinforcements had been deployed to enhance security in the area.
