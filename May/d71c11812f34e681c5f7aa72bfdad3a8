A 17-year-old girl in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand is in a critical condition after she was raped and then set on fire, police say. A local man has been arrested in connection with the attack. It is the second such incident to be reported in Jharkhand in recent days - another teenage girl who police say was raped and burned alive died on Sunday. Police have not indicated the two cases are connected. They come as India reels from a string of violent sexual crimes. The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the trial of eight men, all of them Hindus, who have been arrested in the case, must be held in Punjab because of the deep divisions between the communities.
