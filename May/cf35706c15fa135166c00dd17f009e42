President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged refer the allegations of mismanagement of $16 billion power projects between 1999 and 2007 to the anti-graft agencies for further investigation. The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, (SERAP) made the call yesterday saying anyone involved should face prosecution if there is sufficient admissible evidence. The organization urged Buhari to also refer to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission (ICPC) the alleged squandering of over N11 trillion meant to provide regular electricity supply covering the governments of former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua and Goodluck Jonathan.” Buhari had on Tuesday accused Obasanjo of spending $16bn on power projects during his tenure as the President without corresponding power supply to Nigerians. But responding, Obasanjo said he was already cleared of any wrongdoing concerning the power sector by the National Assembly. SERAP in a statement by its executive director Adetokunbo Mumuni said, “It is only by pursuing all the allegations and taking the evidence before the court that the truth will be revealed and justice best served. This is the only way to conclusively address the systemic corruption in the power sector and an entrenched culture of impunity of perpetrators.”
