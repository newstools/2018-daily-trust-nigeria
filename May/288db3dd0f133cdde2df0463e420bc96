The Local Education Authority (LEA) acting secretary, Abaji area council, Umar Adabakpa Ugbada, has escaped from his kidnappers’ den. Ugbada, while narrating his travail to our reporter at his Gwargwada residence, yesterday, said he and a middle aged woman escaped at about 12am while the kidnappers were asleep. He said since he was abducted about 10 days ago by nine armed kidnappers, he survived by drinking unhygienic water. He said he and the woman escaped when five among the kidnappers went to collect the ransom, while the remaining two gang members who remained with them fell asleep. He said when the four kidnappers slept off, he summoned courage and sneaked out of the hideout, which he said was in a forest among ranges of mountains. He said he trekked from the bush and appeared at Ukya village near Toto in Nasarawa State, adding that  he met some vigilantes on the way who led him back to his Gwargwada village. He said the kidnappers collected N300,000 cash from him on the day he was kidnapped and used it to buy spaghetti and beans to cook for him and the woman while in captivity. “The kidnappers plucked leaves and made a bed to sleep on, but when I asked them to allow me do same, they refused and forced me to sleep on the bare floor, “ he said. The LEA scribe, who was full of joy, thanked friends, relatives and other well-wishers for their prayers and concern for his safe return. City News reported that the LEA scribe was kidnapped 10 days ago along Atako-Rubochi road, after close of work.
