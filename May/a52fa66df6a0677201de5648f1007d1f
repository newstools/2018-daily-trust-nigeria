The People of Jama’are Emirate in Bauchi State have called on Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar to appoint his new deputy from the area following the resignation of the erstwhile Deputy, Engr. Nuhu Gidado, who is also from the area. This was disclosed in a statement by Abubakar El-Sadique, the Press Secretary to Governor Abubakar. The statement quoted a delegation from Jama’are making the plea during a solidarity visit to the governor in Bauchi. The delegation was led by the APC Chairman in Jama’are Local Government Area, Alhaji Yusuf Kawu Gana, the Caretaker Chairman of the council, Alhaji Isa Mohammed Wabi, and the Member representing the area in the House of Assembly, Alhaji Magaji Isa. They reportedly said people of Jama’are would remain loyal to Gov. Abubakar’s administration despite the resignation of the former deputy governor. According to the statement, the delegation commended Gov. Abubakar for finding a son of Jama’are worthy of being entrusted with the position of deputy governor who doubled as commissioner in the state executive council. It also noted that Gov. Abubakar was the first to make it possible for Jama’are to have the number two citizen in the state. They, therefore, pledged continued loyalty to the governor and appealed to him to nominate the new deputy governor from Jama’are. They also pleaded with the governor to appoint a commissioner and permanent secretary to represent the local government at the state level. Responding, Gov. Abubakar reportedly thanked the delegation for the visit and the support he had been receiving from the people of Jama’are. He was quoted to have told the delegation that he had commenced the processes of selecting a new deputy governor by consulting critical stakeholders from the northern senatorial district of the state, saying he would soon transmit the name of the nominee to the House of Assembly for confirmation.
