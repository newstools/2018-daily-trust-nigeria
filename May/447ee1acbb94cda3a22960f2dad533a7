He also stated that the council understood that some federal universities charged fees per course unit, The minister said the government would investigate and stop this. Anwuka said the National Universities Commission had been directed to clarify and update the council on the matter. He said: “We understand some universities now charge fees per course unit and we are going to make sure that we investigate that properly and make it stop. "Students can pay other auxiliary fees, but not in excess. Various university councils and management should be able to fix what fees students should pay that is affordable and acceptable to the students. That is the position. "The federal government does not determine fees for private and state universities. It only takes responsibility for fees paid in the federal universities.” The minister also disclosed that the council approved the insurance of provisional licence for the the establishment of Skyline University in Kano.
