Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Mahmud Mohammed has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) has failed the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) residents. Mohammed, who spoke while accepting the letter of intent from a former councillor in Garki Ward, Bala Iyah, to vie for the party’s ticket for AMAC chairmanship in the 2019 elections, said residents were now better informed on making electoral choices having seen the shortcomings of the APC. “With the way the APC administration is going, everybody is tired of the party especially in FCT and we shall get it right by God’s grace. The assessment of APC in AMAC is its a total failure. They have not been able to fulfill their campaign promises. Some issues they raised against PDP during their campaign today they have tripled such events in AMAC. “We were accused that PDP-led council administration had over 10 consultants making AMAC staff redundant. Today there are over 50 consultants in AMAC, that is a total failure, all staff are just sleeping and nothing is going on there,” he alleged. Bala Iyah in his address to the PDP executives said he was ready to deliver the dividends of democracy to the residents, adding that he planned to focus on education, agriculture and empowerment.
