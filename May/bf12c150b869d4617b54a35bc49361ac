The Chairman, Senate Committee on Navy, Senator Isah Misau, has blamed politicians in the country for the problems Nigeria is facing. Misau said Nigerian politicians withdraw themselves from the people once elected into office. He spoke yesterday during the inauguration of the Nigerian Navy Military School, Ikot-Ntuen, Oruk Anam Local Government Area, of Akwa Ibom State. He urged politicians to learn from military, which works with people irrespective of tribe or religion to attain the countryâ€™s oneness and do not care where their personal aides or assistants hail from. He said he feels proud as chairman of Senate Committee of the Nigerian Navy because of the many things, especially to rescue education. In his response, the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibokette Ibas, said the school is the latest collaboration between the state and the Nigerian Navy. He said the institution is modelled to offer secondary education in a naval environment. Speaking, Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel said with the completion of the school and the Army Command School that will soon be inaugurated in Efa in Etinan LGA, the circle will have been completed.
