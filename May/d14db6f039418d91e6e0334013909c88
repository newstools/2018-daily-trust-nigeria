 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari entered into bilateral negotiations ‎with the United States but failed to raise the issue of drop in the US purchase of Nigeria's crude oil, which it said is the mainstay of the nation's economy. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday said the President failed to project the nation's economic interests before the American government and the world, adding that ‎Nigerians and the business community were aghast at the development. "Also President Buhari had no answers to President Trump's stance that the US has not been investing substantially in Nigeria owing to unconducive economic climate under his administration, further confirming the stand of the PDP that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is running a moribund economy. "More disturbing is the revelation by President Trump that the US has been supporting Nigeria with the sum of $1bn annually whereas President Buhari, in his script, announced that Nigeria received only $500m last year. "We had expected President Buhari, as the ‘African Champion on Anti-Corruption' to immediately respond to President Trump on the whereabouts of the shortfall of $500m. "It is also inexcusable that President Buhari had no answers to the security situation of daily bloodletting and mass killings in Nigeria, which President Trump described as horrible. Instead, he restricted himself to his script, which was silent on the issue. "By this, the American government has summarily indicted President Buhari’s government on its failure to ensure security of lives and property of citizens," the PDP said.
