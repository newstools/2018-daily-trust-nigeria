A disagreement between a commercial motorcyclist and his passenger over a dirty Naira note yesterday in Lagos, turned bloody as irate youths beat the cyclist to a state of comma. The cyclist, identified as Okon Akpan, had conveyed his passenger, also identified as Miss Titilope Fatai, from Okokomaiko to Iyanoba market for a fee of N200. Trouble however started when Fatai gave the cyclist N500 and Akpan gave his passenger her N300 balance, made up of N200 and N100 notes. The lady returned the N100 note and requested for replacement on the grounds that it was “too dirty”. A heated argument ensued as the cyclist insisted he did not have a neater note to replace the ‘smelling’ one as demanded by his passenger. As Akpan tried to leave without replacing the money, the lady slapped him and he in return, started beating her. Unknown to the cyclist, the lady was popular among the street urchins around, who in turn, reacted by giving Akpan a thorough beating. His fellow commercial motorcyclists had to come to his rescue, after which they took him to an undisclosed hospital. A traffic policeman at the scene, Mr Uzochukwu Amadi, described as ‘dreadful’ the behaviour of the youths. Reacting to the incident, a lecturer with the Lagos State University, Dr Kaka Afolabi, appealed to the Central Bank of Nigeria to inject new Naira notes into the system, adding that the current ones in circulation were ‘eye sores’. “We expect the authorities concerned to act quickly before more Nigerians fall victims of dirty Naira notes. “Our present N100 is the worst; it is no longer durable and its acceptability has become subject of debates during transactions, thereby leading to quarrels in most cases,’’ he noted.(NAN)
