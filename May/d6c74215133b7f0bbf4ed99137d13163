The 7 Division of the Nigerian Army yesterday got a new General Officer Commanding (GOC), Brig. Gen Bulama Biu, following the deployment of Maj Gen Ibrahim Yusuf to the Army Headquarters. Yusuf, while handing over command of the four-year-old division to the new GOC at the Maimalari Barracks in Maiduguri yesterday, hailed the destruction of Boko Haram enclaves. “The high point in the division has been the successful wipe away of Boko Haram camps at the heartland of Sambisa. I mean places like Camp Zero, Pariso and other enclaves. One thing I am going to miss is the cooperation from troops, paramilitary and stakeholders, they have been very supportive,” he Yusuf said. 7 Division was established in 2013 to boost  counter insurgency operations. Maj.-Gen. Ibrahim Yusuf was deployed to the Nigerian Army Resource Centre, Abuja, as Director, Army Consult. Biu hails from Borno State, and is the eighth GOC of the Division since its formation in 2013.
