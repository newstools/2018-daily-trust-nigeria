The Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) has designed a social insurance scheme aimed at compensating workers whenever they suffer injuries from workplace accidents. This was contained in a release signed by Tesh Kibikiwa, NSITF’s DGM Health, Safety and Environment. Called ‘Employee’s Compensation Scheme’, the social insurance scheme is designed for serving employees to ensure they are adequately protected with regards to compensation whenever they suffer injuries from workplace accidents, injury in the course of work outside the workplace, and diseases emanating from working conditions. NSITF added that this is in fulfillment of the ECA, 2010, and while listing ways to prevent workplace accidents, pointed out that in order to be compensated by government through NSITF for any death, injury, disease or disability arising out of or in the course of work, employers must register with the body and obtain the ECS Certificate. In addition, the employer must contribute one percent of the employee’s salary monthly which is not deducted from the employee’s salary. The organisation said these measures are necessary because 6,300 people die every day as a result of workplace accidents or related diseases.
