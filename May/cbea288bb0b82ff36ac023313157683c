Armenia’s parliament failed to elect a new prime minister after a special session, deepening a political crisis following two weeks of protests against the government. The only candidate for the post of interim prime minister was Nikol Pashinyan, 42, the opposition leader who called for mass demonstrations. Pashinyan, who led the protests that forced prime minister Serzh Sargsyan to resign last week, said the Republican Party’s decision on Tuesday not to back his candidacy was an “insult to the people”. He was greeted by a jubilant crowd of tens of thousands in central Yerevan, the capital, after losing the vote. Pashinyan said starting from on Wednesday morning his supporters would launch a general strike and block roads, railways stations and airports.
