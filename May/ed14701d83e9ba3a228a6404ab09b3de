The chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT, Alhaji Abdulmalik Usman, has said  his party is poised to win the FCT Senate seat which the opposition Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) has occupied since 2007. Usman, while speaking with newsmen in Abuja, yesterday, after a meeting with some party stakeholders, said the task ahead of the party was to see how it would win the FCT Senate seat in the 2019 elections. He said the ruling APC in the FCT had made significant strides towards that goal as it won five out of the six area councils in the 2016 council polls. He said that the party would this time win the 62 wards across the six area councils during the 2019 polls. “We want to make it categorically clear that it is not yet over until APC takes over the Senate seat and all the 62 wards across the six area councils come 2019 election, which is a task we must accomplish,” he said. He said the party was also making arrangement to embark on a thank you tour of all the party’s stakeholders across the FCT towards their support and sacrifices in ensuring a peaceful congress.
