A presidential aspirant of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Comrade Oladele Nihi on Thursday commended President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting the 'Not Too Young To Run Bill', describing it as an opportunity for more youth participation in the electoral processes at all levels Nihi, who is the Kogi State Chairman of NYCN, gave the commendation in a statement issued in Lokoja.

According to him, the law would create a sense of belonging in the progressive and sustainable Nigeria that the APC government was building across the country.

Nihi further commended Buhari for the successes his administration had achieved so far in providing security, anti-corruption fight, economic development and social welfare.

"We are grateful to the President Buhari, who is the father of our nation for being a listening father and heeding to the yearnings and aspirations of the teeming Nigeria youths. 

"We are calling on all Nigeria youths both at home and in diaspora to take advantage of this great opportunity to be actively involved by signifying their interest in any elective position of their choice.

"This is the right time for us as youths to take the 'bull by the horn', re-strategize, and refocus our attention to get things right because our future is in out hand,,"  

He, however appealed to the President to reconsider his decision on the Peace Corps Bill, and see what could be done in order for the bill to also get his assent.

“The Peace Corps Bill is one which, when signed into law, possesses the capacity to accommodate thousands of the unemployed youths in the country.

“The Bill will also complement the efforts of other security agencies in the fight against crime and insecurity which the Buhari government is very serious about. We will always ask for more," Nihi said.
