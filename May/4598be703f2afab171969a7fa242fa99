Members of the FCT State Executive Council (SEC) of Labour Party (LP) have passed a vote of confidence on their chairman, Joseph Ndirang. The executives, who made this known while addressing journalists, yesterday, said they would not recognise other executives from what they described as a ‘kangaroo congress’ without the approval of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the party’s National Executive Council. Ndirang observed with dismay, the continuous flagrant breach of the party’s constitution, the arrogation of absolute power to self and open disregard to constituted authorities by the National Chairman and Deputy National Secretary, Abdulkadir Abdulsalam and Julius Abure respectively. He said in a bid to restore sanity in the FCT chapter of the party, the SEC resolved to move its office from Garki to Labour House, Central Business District, pending the resolution of the party’s National Executive Council (NEC) and the Nigeria Labour Congress leadership. Ndirang, who is also the chairman of the party’s state chairman forum said any congress organised without the approval of INEC and the support of the party’s National Executive Council (NEC) would not be recognised. “Any so-called kangaroo congress called by Salam and Abure without INEC and the present state executives is unconstitutional, null and void with no effect whatsoever,” he said. He said the state executive council pledged its support and loyalty to the constituted organs of the party and to the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress.
