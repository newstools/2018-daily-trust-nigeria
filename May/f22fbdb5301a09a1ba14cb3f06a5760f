The bilateral trade volume between Nigeria and the European Union reached €25.3bn in 2017, the Head of EU delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr Ketil Karlsen has said. Karlsen, while briefing newsmen Wednesday in Abuja on the forthcoming Europe Day May 9, said this figure was an increase of 27% from that of 2016, which stood at €19.9 billion. He said about 50% of the 2017 trade value was in favour of Nigeria. “About 25.3 billion Euro was traded in 2017. There is clear significant surplus in the benefit of Nigeria. Of the trade volume, around 50% more is actually benefitting Nigeria,” the envoy said.
