There was a mild drama at a residential area of Ketu when an Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (Ikeja Electric) official was bitten by dog while trying to disconnect electricity. City News gathered yesterday that the incident happened last Tuesday at a place called Oladele along Ketu-Ikosi road. The electricity official (name withheld) was said to have gone to a residential building to disconnect light over indebtedness by some tenants in the house. But unknown to the Ikeja Electric official, there are two dogs inside the gated compound. City News further gathered that one of the tenants who was believed to be defaulting in payment of electricity Bill was incidentally the owner of the dogs. A resident of Ketu who narrated the incident to our correspondent said, “I learnt the NEPA man came with the intent to cut their light. But he has not even climbed the pole when one of the dogs charged at him. The dog eventually bit him and injured the man in the leg.” It was gathered that the official was rushed to the nearby hospital where he was given injection and the wound plastered. However he has since been discharged and returned home. It was not clear who paid for the hospital bill as of the time of filing this report. Another resident who spoke on the incident said, “We are surprised that the dog is becoming violent in recent times. Even those of us who live around, if you would see the way the dog would be  violently barking at us as if it wants to bite you. The other smaller dog is not violent as this particular one that bit this electricity official.” The owner of the dog was said to have traveled when our correspondent visited the place. Spokesman of IKEDC, Felix Ofulue could not be reached for comments yesterday as of the time of filing his report.
