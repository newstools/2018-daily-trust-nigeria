Three silver and six bronze awards of laptops and digital tablet devices respectively were also presented to pupils from primary schools in Jikwoyi, Kuje and Bwari.  Ten other artworks were also selected for award. This year’s drawing contest was titled ‘Peace and Conflict Resolution’. In his remarks, the director of the centre, Mr Han Sungrae, explained the choice of the theme, saying “peace is returning around the Korean peninsula…Both leaders of North and South agreed to pursue a lasting peace on the peninsula through denuclearization. “We recognize how important peace is and that is why we have encouraged the young ones to bear out their minds on what they envision peace to be.” The director of FCT Universal Basic Education (UBE) Board, Dr Adamu Jatau, thanked the South Korean Ambassador and the cultural centre for their continued support to basic education in Nigeria. He reiterated the board’s commitment to supporting the laudable programme, which he said, would further improve the pupils’ performance in cultural and creative arts.
