Three suspected vandals were arrested on Sunday morning for vandalizing a transformer feeding the residence of President Muhammadu Buhari along Sultan road in Kaduna.

A statement by Kaduna Electric's head of corporate communication, Abdulazeez Abdullahi said that the miscreants vandalized cables on the transformer which affected power supply to residents feeding from it.

He also stated that the arrested suspects were taken to the Unguwan Rimi police station and are expected to be charged to court as soon as the police is done with its investigation. 

While the company commended the arrest of the suspected vandals, it assured that it will cooperate with the authorities to ensure the culprits face justice. 

Abdulazeez however, urged customers to help in the fight against vandalism, which according to him is one of the major impediments to adequate power supply.
