The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has commissioned the weather station at the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Kaduna State. NiMet also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the varsity on weather data sharing. Commissioning the facility, Professor Sani Abubakar Mashi, the Director-General/CEO of NiMet said the partnership between NiMet and ABU, Zaria will greatly enhance the capacity of NiMet to give valuable and accurate weather information. “Weather is one critical element that affects everyone. As a university, we believe you have a mandate to produce quality manpower in different aspects of life in order to promote sustainable development particularly in the country. We believe that your mandate and our mandate have a point of convergence, in that whatever manpower, in which field you produce, whether in medicine, agriculture, environmental management, requires weather information because weather affects everything” he said. The Vice Chancellor of ABU, Professor Ibrahim Garba promised not only to integrate the study of meteorology in the programmes of the university but also provide the necessary support and security for the weather station.
