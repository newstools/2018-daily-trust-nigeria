The Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the FCT to embark on adequate sensitization and awareness of rural people about the collection of permanent voters card across the six area councils ahead of the 2019 general elections. Nizazo, who spoke during an interview our reporter, yesterday, at his palace, said many people from the communities had been disenfranchised at every election as they find it difficult to access voters card. He said there was need for the FCT INEC to embark on sensitization across villages in the territory on the PVC registration, noting that it was the responsibility of the commission to educate the public. He said it was disturbing that even at INEC registration centres where voters were expected to be registered, the staff were hardly available on ground to attend to voters. According to him, there was need for INEC to decentralize the registration and collection of PVCs to other districts and villages for easy access by eligible voters. He therefore urged adults who are yet to register and the youth that have attained the age of 18 years to go and get registered.
