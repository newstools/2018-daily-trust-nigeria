An FCT High Court in Gudu will today deliver judgment in the case of alleged misappropriation of N1.64 billion state funds filed against former governor of Taraba state, Rev. Jolly Nyame. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) charged Nyame on June 22, 2010 on a 21-count charge bordering on misappropriation of funds to the tune of N1.64 billion while in office. Justice Adebukola Banjoko, after the adoption of final written addresses on February 28, adjourned the matter to May 30 for judgment. Nyame’s counsel, Olalekan Ojo had told the court that the confessional statement the EFCC relied on was marred by inconsistency and therefore urged the court to discountenance it. He said no witness in the course of the protracted trial testified or brought out any evidence to prove that Nyame diverted any funds from Taraba Government coffers. However, EFCC’s counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), said the prosecution called fourteen relevant witnesses to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that Nyame’s statement reproduced as evidence supported the prosecution in the case.
