The Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier General Suleiman Kazaure, has advised corps members to be security conscious at all times. In a statement signed by the Director, Press and Publications of the scheme, Mrs Adenike Adeyemi, the DG gave the advice on Friday, while addressing the 2018 Batch ‘A’ corps members at the orientation camp in Obubra, Cross River State. He noted that they would be posted to new environments after the orientation course and urged the youths to be wary of people with questionable characters, but conduct themselves appropriately. He warned the female corps members to avoid indecent dressing that may contradict the cultural beliefs of their host communities. The Director-General also urged them to add value to their host communities through the provision of developmental projects. State coordinator of the scheme, Ambekemo Eniola, informed the Director General that 2,116 corps members were present in the camp. She however lamented that the camp has yet to be connected to the national grid, causing it to depend on power generating set.
