President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday met a former governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole. The close-door meeting, which lasted about two hours, was held inside the president’s office at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja. Oshiomhole was accompanied by the chairman of the APC Governors’ Forum, Rochas Okorocha of Imo State. This was ahead of the June national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Oshiomhole is seeking to replace the national chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, who is also a former governor of Edo State. President Buhari had recently asked all the APC governors to throw their weights behind Oshiomhole for the party’s topmost position. Oshiomhole is also believed to have the backing of a national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. The Presidency said President Muhammadu Buhari’s position that will not interfere in the affairs of the APC or matters before the law courts. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, made this known in a statement yesterday. The presidential spokesman was dismissing media reports that the Presidency substituted members of the APC Convention Planning Subcommittees. “We are constrained to deny media reports alleging that the Presidency substituted or smuggled in some names of members of the APC Convention Planning Sub-Committees. “Nothing in the allegation can be further from the truth in every material particular. For the umpteenth time, we wish to reiterate President Muhammadu Buhari’s position that he will not interfere in party affairs or matters before the law courts.” According to Adesina, it ought to have been obvious by now to discerning Nigerians that it is not in Buhari’s nature to go against the provisions of the country’s constitution let alone his party’s constitutional provisions. Rising from the meeting with the president yesterday, Oshiomhole and Okorocha refused to speak to State House correspondents on their mission to Aso Rock.
