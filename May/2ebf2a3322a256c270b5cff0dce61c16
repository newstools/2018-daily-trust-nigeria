The National Secretary of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Alhaji Shehu Gabam, yesterday said in Abuja that the political environment to the 2019 general elections looks chaotic, following increasing cases of killing and kidnapping in the country. Gabam, who spoke with newsmen on the state of the nation, added that the SDP was disturbed by the rate at which the security situation had degenerated. “No responsible party will accept this kind of situation. SDP tasks the federal government to live up to its oath of office to protect lives and property of Nigerians. We call on President Muhammadu Buhari to curtail these excesses and killings in Zamfara, Benue and Kaduna. We thank the Senate for summoning the security chiefs. Since 2019 is quite unpredictable, it means we are living under an unpredictable situation leading to 2019 general elections. He advised the judiciary to guide its independence and upbraided the executive arm of government for allegedly encouraging the harassment of opposition politicians who share different views. “That situation will not augur well for this country. It will ridicule Nigeria internationally. They (government) should allow participatory democracy in all spheres of governance,” he added. Speaking on the party’s presidential candidate, Gabam said the person must not only have knowledge of Nigeria but also show concern about the country’s unity.
