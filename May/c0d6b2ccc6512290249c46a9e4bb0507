The Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole has condoled with the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) over a road crash involving some members of the union at the weekend. A statement from the ministry last night said Professor Adewole wished the injured JOHESU members quick recovery. The Minister said he was in touch with the Chief Medical Directors of University of Benin Teaching Hospital, UBTH, and Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital on the need to offer comprehensive medical attention to the injured JOHESU members. Nineteen members of JOHESU were involved in an accident along the Benin-Auchi road on Saturday. They were reportedly staff of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) chapter of the union. Forty of the health workers were on their way to a function in Auchi, when the accident occurred. The injured victims were subsequently rushed to the Otibho Okhai Hospital in Irrua, Edo State. The union has been on strike since April 17, despite an order of the National Industrial Court in Abuja last Thursday for them to resume work within 24 hours.
