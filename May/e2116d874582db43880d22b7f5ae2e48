The Northern Christian Elders Forum (NOCEF) has expressed shock over the death of one of their strong pillars and General Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr. Musa Asake. The spokesman of the NOCEF, Sunday Oibe, said in a statement on Friday that they were in pains because it is very difficult to use one word or expression to describe Asake, who died Friday at 66 after a brief illness. “But Asake is an epitome of humility, unassuming and selfless man who is not greedy. In my interaction with him since I met him, Asake keeps telling me that he was born in poverty, enjoys growing in poverty and doesn’t look for money. But he held on to his fate very strongly and his passion for the church in Nigeria, particularly in the North is very wonderful. “His death has created a very big vacuum in the body of Christ in Nigeria, the North, NOCEF and TEKAN/ECWA. Asake is many things to different people. But to us, he’s a hero that deserves celebration. You can see the humility of Jesus Christ in him. Anytime we talk, Philippians Chapter 2 guides him. It said, ‘let this man be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.’ He is guided by the spirit of humility, as exemplified by the Lord, Jesus Christ. People who are Junior to Asake will abuse him, and Asake will take it humbly,” Oibe said.
