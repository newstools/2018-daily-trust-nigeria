Thousands of protesters have marched in the Nicaraguan capital Managua and other cities to demand the resignation of President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice-President Rosario Murillo. Demonstrators blocked main roads, waving placards and chanting slogans. Weeks of anti-government protests have led to at least 76 people being killed in clashes with security forces. The latest rallies took place after peace talks mediated by the Catholic Church broke down on Wednesday. Four people were killed in clashes on Saturday, police and witnesses say. “They want to take us off the streets at the point of bullets,” said protest leader Francisca Ramírez, who led a rally in the north-west city of Leon.
