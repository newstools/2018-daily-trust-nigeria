President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday met with a former governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole. The closed-door meeting, which lasted about two hours, was held inside the president’s office at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja. Oshiomhole was accompanied by the chairman of the APC Governors’ Forum, Rochas Okorocha of Imo State. This meeting is coming ahead of the June national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Oshiomhole is seeking to replace the national chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun. President Buhari had recently asked all the APC governors to throw their weight behind their former colleague for the party’s topmost position. Oshiomhole is also believed to have the backing of the national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu. Rising from the meeting with the president yesterday, however, Oshiomhole and Okorocha refused to speak to State House correspondents on their mission to Aso Rock.
