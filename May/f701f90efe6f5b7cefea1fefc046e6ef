The Igala Nurses and Midwives Association (INAMA), Abuja chapter has called on the government and other authorities concerned to make available sanitary pads for girls in secondary schools. Speaking during an outreach programme at the Federal Government Girls College (FGGC), Bwari in Abuja, the President of INAMA, Mrs Christy Awunor said, “Studies have shown that about 61 per cent of girls use tissue papers and rags instead of the regular sanitary pad because they cannot afford it. “We are advocating for them even at the school to buy sanitary pad in school just the way they give them meals in school. Government can assist to give these girls pad every month, at least one for a child,” she appealed. The female students were exposed to sex education, drug abuse, sexual abuse and how to report such. The association also distributed sanitary pads, deodorant and drugs for the dispensaries. Founder of INAMA, Mrs Helen Wada, said the outreach was to mark the ongoing annual Nursing Week. “We felt the need for outsiders to come and reinforce this education we have given them,” she added. The Vice Principal, Special Duties, FGGC Bwari, Husseini Atai Andrew, said, “It is a very important outreach because we are into girl child education” as such education on morality about their relationship with their peers and   the male folk is very important and integral.” The Head Prefect, Fatima Binta Ibrahim, in her vote of thanks said “Although most of the junior students have not started menstruating, it was good to sensitise them before they start.”
