The Kwara State Government says it is not indebted to any contractor handling its road projects in the state under the Kwara Infrastructure Development Fund (IFK).

The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works and Transport , Alhaji Yusuf Garba Manjo said this in his office while answering questions from newsmen.

He explained that the government had adopted a system of pay as you go as contractors were paid for all jobs done immediately the government evaluates their work and satisfied with their certificates.

According to him, all the contractors were paid on quarterly basis in accordance with the IFK payment schedule, stressing that just last week, they were paid for all jobs already completed.

He denied claims in some quarters that the state government was not patronizing local contractors and mentioned some few contractors that have benefitted from the government's jobs.
