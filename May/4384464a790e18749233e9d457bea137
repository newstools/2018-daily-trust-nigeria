The chairman of DAAR communications, Raymond Dokpesi is saying the US has revoked his visa after he was accused of looting Nigeria’s treasury.

Lai Mohammed, minister of information, had listed Dokpesi, among other chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as those who looted public funds.

Dokpesi is currently standing trial for allegedly receiving N2.1 billion from the office of the national security adviser (ONSA).

On Monday, Dokpesi had dragged Mohammed to the FCT high court over the publication, seeking payment of N5billion damages for “defamation of character”.

He had earlier written the minister, threatening the lawsuit if his name is not retracted from the list. READ ALSO: Looters'' list: Dokpesi demands apology, plans N5bn suit
