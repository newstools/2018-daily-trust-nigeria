Authorities in Comoros questioned former president Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi on Tuesday over his role in a scheme to sell citizenship that investigators say was riddled with corrupt practice. Sambi had been summoned to report to the gendarmerie’s investigations brigade on Tuesday morning but was instead questioned at his home, according to two sources and the summons seen by Reuters. The prosecutor’s office issued an order preventing Sambi and another ex-president Ikililou Dhoinine, who succeeded Sambi, from traveling.
