The House of Representatives will pass the 2018 budget next week, House spokesman, Abdulrazaq Namdas, told journalists during a press briefing in Abuja yesterday. Namdas said the House considers the budget a national interest; hence the need to expedite action to ensure that it was laid before the House on Tuesday and subsequently passed within the week. “We will pass this budget next week. I am not speculating. I am telling you the fact. This is something that has to do with national interest,” Namdas said. Asked why the House has not observed the 3-day protest break in solidarity with victims of herdsmen’ killings as resolved last week, Namdas said the House has not forgotten the resolution.
