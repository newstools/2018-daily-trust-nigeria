Neymar has sent former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi a “brutal message” about Real Madrid, according to reports in Spain.

Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar, who is currently sidelined with a broken metatarsal, has been continually linked with a move to Real Madrid.

Despite a season-ending injury, Neymar was in exceptional form beforehand, scoring 25 goals in all competitions.

But instead of staying to join in with PSG’s Ligue 1 celebrations, he flew back home to Brazil. READ ALSO:Neymar gives condition for Real Madrid transfer Although he only joined from Barcelona last summer for a world-record fee of £200million, the Brazilian is already eyeing a departure.

And according to Spanish publication Don Balon, Neymar has made it very clear to Messi that Real Madrid are the team that will leave Barcelona in their wake in the seasons to come, even though the latter have already won the Copa del Rey and La Liga once he joins them.

Don Balon also suggests that Real’s chances of landing Neymar appear to be very remote.

When asked how he would feel if Los Blancos did strike a deal for Neymar, Barca chief Josep Maria Bartomeu said: “It would not hurt me, I like that the good players are in La Liga.

“He decides but he has a contract with PSG for the next four years.

“Our first priority is Barcelona and then that La Liga is competitive. Our first rival is the Premier League.” READ ALSO: Neymar to Real Madrid more likely than Barca return – Iniesta

But he insists he would welcome Neymar back to the Nou Camp, adding: "Of course yes.

“We enjoyed him for four seasons [here] and he is a very good player. I do not think that PSG want to sell him.”
