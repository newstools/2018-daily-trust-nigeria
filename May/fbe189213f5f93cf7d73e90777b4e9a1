Those arrested were identified as Muyiwa Talabi, Tunde Adeyemi, Korede Pariosho, Dayo Johnson, Segun Saka, Niyi Adeshina, Michael Oluwaseun and Afolabi Ismail. It was learnt that the police had gotten information about the attack and consequently deployed a team led by the officer-in-charge of FSARS, Deputy Superintendent Uba Adam to investigate it. The Commissioner of Police Ogun State, Ahmed lliyasu, who confirmed the arrest, said that the police spotted the suspects heading out of Abeokuta and trailed them to a nearby forest where the battle of who controls the area was scheduled to take place. Iliyasu said that on noticing that they were being trailed, the suspects retreated and headed back to their hideout. “The police team followed them and rounded them up where they were holding a meeting preparatory for another deadly clash. The O/C FSARS, with his men, were able to arrest eight of them with various types of dangerous arms and ammunition. “During interrogations, it was discovered that Talabi and Adeshina of the Aiye group hacked down the victim of Wednesday’s clash. It was also discovered that one of their accomplices, who also played a prominent role in last Wednesday’s fracas, was traced to his house by the rival group and hacked to death early this morning before the police got to his house to arrest him. “In the process, the police recovered two pump action guns, four locally made double-barrelled pistols, 11 live cartridges and assorted charms from their hideout,” the Ogun police boss said.
