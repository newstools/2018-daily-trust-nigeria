‎A former governor of Kaduna State, Senator Ahmed Makarfi has called on security agencies and government at all levels to advance new strategies to end killings in Kaduna and other states of the federation. Makarfi in a statement on Monday by his Spokesman, Mukhtar Zubairu Sirajo, also called for deployment of more security personnel, equipment as well as other logistics to the affected areas in the state and especially in Birnin Gwari, to reassure the people that they were not abandoned. The former PDP boss explained that the security of lives and property was government's responsibility and asked security agents to arrest perpetrators of the killings and bring them to book. "The frequency, impotence as well as impunity with which bandits raid communities in some parts of the country and leave unchallenged is a source of worry for all patriotic Nigerians. "The latest of such brazen violations of the peace and security of the people, which occurred earlier today in Gwaska of Birnin  Gwari Local Government Area of  Kaduna State, which itself was the second time in under a week certainly is becoming one too many. "Government exists principally to provide security to the people; failure to rise up to this responsibility is therefore a recipe for anarchy which we cannot afford now. "Governments at all levels as well as agencies responsible must therefore restore people's confidence by doing all it takes to not only secure the area and others so afflicted, but also ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book," he said. ‎‎
