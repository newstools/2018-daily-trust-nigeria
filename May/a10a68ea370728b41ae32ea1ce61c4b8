Rivers State Governor Nyesom  Wike said yesterday that the  federal government denied the state what he called the Budget Support Fund. Governor Wike said that he was reliably informed that the Budget Support Fund for Rivers State was withheld because of his critical stance on national issues, adding that all other states have received the fund. Wike spoke during the commissioning of three road projects by former Delta State governor, Chief James Ibori.
