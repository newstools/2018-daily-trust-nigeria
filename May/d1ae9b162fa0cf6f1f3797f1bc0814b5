The police in Katsina have apprehended one of its auxiliary civilian staff over alleged possession of 103 SIM cards and 13 passport photographs of police officers. Aminu Mustapha, 25, a cleaner at the divisional police headquarters located along Magama-Jibia road, was said to have failed to provide convincing explanation on the items found in his possession. He was arrested on April 30 and transferred to the state criminal investigation department in Katsina for further interrogation. Already, the police have arraigned the suspected before a senior magistrateâ€™s court for failing to provide information on what and why the items were used for contrary to Section 319(A) of the penal code.
