According to Kazeem, visibility is always low, while there is accompanied foggy weather during this period. He said the Corps Marshal, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, has expressed worry at the rate at which people neglect the basic ethics of driving during the rainy season, which results in avoidable crashes, death and fatal injuries in some cases. Kazeem stated that the Corps Marshal is advising all motorists to make sure their vehicles are in order, stating that it is important for all motorists to ensure their braking systems, wipers and headlamps are in good shape.
