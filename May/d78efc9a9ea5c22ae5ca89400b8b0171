The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), under the leadership of its President-General and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar 111, has expressed sorrow on the news of the death of the General Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr. Musa Idowu Asake, who died in the early hours of Friday after a brief illness. The Secretary-General of the NSCIA, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, in a statement yesterday quoted the Sultan as saying that Dr. Asake was relatively a young man but that death does not consider age, time and place in its diary of operation in the life of humans. “Thus, the occurrence of death in the life of Dr. Asake as in many other lives is a further reminder and confirmation that human life is transient. We all live to die and die to live again. “Death is a phenomenon which can neither be averted nor altered when it is time for it to act especially in human life. As the General Secretary of CAN, Dr. Asake was an active member of Nigerian Interreligious Council (NIREC) whose role was prominent in the operations of that Council. His death will no doubt create a vacuum in the interreligious community, which may be difficult to fill,” the statement said. The Sultan Abubakar and the entire Nigerian Muslim Ummah condole with the leadership of CAN and sympathize with the family of Dr. Asake, praying the Almighty God to grant them the fortitude to bear the loss.
