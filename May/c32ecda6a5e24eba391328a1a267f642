The  National Commission for Refugees, Migrants, and Internally Displaced  Persons (NCFRMI) and United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees  (UNHCR) have registered some 21,291 Cameroonian refugees in Nigeria  following the crisis in the neighbouring country.

In  a statement on Thursday in Abuja, UNHCR said children and women  constitute 77 percent of the refugee population from Cameroon.

"Living  in 40 different locations across four states – Cross River, Benue, Akwa  Ibom, and Taraba – the refugees have been arriving in Nigeria since  October 2017," the statement signed by Elizabeth Mpimbaza, UNHCR's  Senior External Relations Officer said.

She  also said the UN Refugee Agency had moved some 331 of the refugees from  Abande to Anyake, Kwande Local Government Area (LGA) settlement, in a  move intended to help provide care and protection to them.

"The  essence of this relocation exercise by UNHCR and the Nigerian  Government is to ensure that the Cameroonian refugees live in safety,  and in respect of the international humanitarian norm that refugees  should stay at least 50 kilometres from the borders." 

She  said over the past few months, UNHCR, state authorities, Norwegian  Church Aid, and the residents of the host community had worked  tirelessly to construct a transit site, two multipurpose housing  facilities, 32 temporary shelters, and 24 latrines in preparation for  the move to Anyake, located 66 kilometres from Abande, Benue state. 

Over  the next few months, there will be more voluntary relocations to Anyake  settlement, which can host some 3,000 to 4,000 Cameroonian refugees,  the UNHCR spokesperson noted.
