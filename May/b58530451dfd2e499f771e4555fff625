Niger State Governor Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has blamed his predecessors in office, especially the immediate past administration of Dr Muazu Babaginda Aliyu for the sorry state of infrastructure across the state. In an interactive session with journalists on Wednesday in Minna, Gov Bello said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration failed to build on the infrastructure it met but indulged in wasting spending. He said infrastructure in all the sectors were in rot but the PDP administration turned blind eye and instead embarked on bogus projects which cost were often inflated even as some of the projects were abandoned midway. Giving an example of a hospital built in Nasko, Magama local government by the immediate past administration at the cost of N600 million, Gov Bello said the project was misplaced, adding that what the town required was a standard primary healthcare centre that would meet the need of the people. “The cost of that hospital now with Naira at N350 to the Dollar is equivalent to N2 billion but what is most disheartening is that the major part of the hospital is now been inhabited by goats and other domestic animals,” he said. He said the state cannot boast of good access roads when he took over, while school infrastructures are in dilapidated state, with health facilities also in terrible state. He explained that because of the magnitude of the challenges he saw during his electioneering campaign ahead of 2015 election, he was careful not to make any promises to Nigerlites. He said he was very careful not to commit himself during the campaign "because that time we had an idea of the challenges, we had an the idea of the infrastructural gap, we had an idea of all the project that were abandoned.  "But we didn't get the full information on debt of problems until we were sworn in so that made it difficult for us to make promises. We knew if we had promised heaven and earth, we will be in problems", he noted.
