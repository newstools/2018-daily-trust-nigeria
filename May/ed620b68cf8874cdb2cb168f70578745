The former minister of environment, Mrs. Laurentia Malam has called on women journalists in Kaduna state to preach and promote peace in their communities; saying there is no alternative to peace. She made the call on Wednesday during a paper presentation at a one day workshop themed ‘Peace: a veritable tool and instrument for national development’ organized by the Kaduna state chapter of National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ). While she identified rural-urban migration, herders/farmers conflicts, kidnapping, trafficking, cultism and robbery among others as threats to peace in the country; she said, “All hands must be on deck, otherwise, we will all be consumed. Government alone cannot handle these problems,” she said while she called on civil society organizations, market women organizations, law enforcement agencies and the general public to rise up to condemn the evil that is about to bring Nigeria to its knees. “All those responsible for one form of evil or the other must be exposed and dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the land. There must be no sacred cows. We expect good governance at all levels in Nigeria, civil servants must be transparent and accountable in discharging their duties with the fear of God. Also, religious leaders must not use religion to divide us,” she urged. Earlier in her opening remark, the state chairperson of NAWOJ, Juliet Oyoyo stressed the need to seek ways to promote and sustain peaceful co-existence in the society. “NAWOJIANS apart from being journalists working under challenging conditions are also home builders and partners in progress in seeking ways to ensure peaceful society for our children and generations to come,” Women according to her are the bedrock of the family and society and as such must rise up to condemn the factors that are threatening the peace of the nation.
