A  non-governmental organisation, Royal Initiative Against Poverty and Starvation, has donated relief materials to the internally displaced persons at the Kuchingoro camp in Abuja. It also donated food items, school uniforms, teaching and learning materials to the City of Refuge Orphanage Home at Durumi at the weekend. The leader of the organisation, James Okpanachi, decried the level of starvation at various IDP camps in Nigeria. Okpanachi said starvation and hunger kill about 90,000 children in the country every year, adding that a situation where 70 percent of the population was living below one dollar per day was an extreme case. “It is hard to be productive at that level. We believe we should partner with the government to raise the living standard of the IDPs and Nigerians generally,” he said. He said his group would employ 10 teachers for school-age children at the IDPs’ camp, adding that “We also want to bring computers, books, desks and other logistics to the school. We partner with donors from the United Kingdom to achieve these objectives.” The chairman of the camp, Emmanuel Philemon, asked the government to provide soft loans that would enable IDPs to farm for self-sustenance.
