 The Ogun State government has disclosed that the planned commissioning of 50 projects to mark the celebration of the 3rd anniversary of the second term of Sen. Ibikunle Amosun from May 29, has been put off as a result of the ongoing Ramadan. The Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Barr. Taiwo Adeoluwa, disclosed this in a statement released on Friday. He said, "in keeping with our well known ‘Ogun Standard’, the State Government plans to commemorate this year’s anniversary with the commissioning of some of the over 50 new projects, spread across the three geo-political zones. "However, in deference to our Islamic faithful, who are currently observing Ramadan fast across the country, the Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has directed that the commissioning of projects earlier scheduled to take place on Tuesday, 29th May, 2018 (Democracy Day), be postponed, till the last week in June, when the Ramadan fast would have been over." Adeoluwa used the opportunity "to congratulate the good people of Ogun State and Nigerians on this auspicious occasion of yet another Democracy Day in the history of our dear country and the 3rd anniversary of the 2nd term of the Senator Ibikunle Amosun-led administration in the state. "It would be recalled that last year, the celebration was marked with an inspection tour of projects across the state, which was rounded off with the commissioning of the MITROS Residences, at the GRA, Ibara, in Abeokuta. "We use this special occasion to once again appreciate Ogun stakeholders, for their tremendous support and prayers over the years, which have been largely responsible for the massive turn-around of the fortunes of the state. "As we journey on and continue to work tirelessly to further fulfill our mandate to “Rebuild the State”, we urge you not to relent as Ogun remains “work in progress," the SSG stated.
