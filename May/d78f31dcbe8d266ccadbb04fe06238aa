The Federal Capital Territory Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board is set to commence the first phase of its education and orientation exercise for intending pilgrims for this year’s hajj. A statement by the spokesman of the board, Muhammad Lawal Aliyu, said Islamic scholars have already been mobilized for the exercise scheduled to take place at the permanent hajj camp in Abuja on Saturday May 5, 2018.  He explained that the exercise would be conducted in four phases to enable the intending pilgrims get enlightened on the hajj rites as well as new policies introduced for this year’s hajj by the Saudi authorities and the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON). The spokesman advised intending pilgrims from the territory for this year’s hajj to participate in the four exercises which are aimed at educating them and assisting them to attain acceptable hajj. He also reminded all intending pilgrims who were yet to return their completed application forms or submit their international passports to do so to enable the board commence the processing of their travel documents. He advised intending pilgrims, particularly the first timers, to take advantage of the orientation exercise and enhance their Islamic knowledge on hajj rites and proper guidance to get value for their money through acceptable hajj.
