Africare in collaboration with Glisten International School under the platform of Power Forward has sensitized residents of  Jahi community on malaria. Dr. Patrick Adah, Director of Malaria Project for Africare said that the event was  aimed at sensitizing the public about the different strategies of malaria control, and to let the members of the community  know that malaria is preventable and could be treated. He said tackling malaria required a collaborative effort and that the Ministry of Health could not handle it alone. “Malaria should be everybody’s concern and that is why we are creating awareness so that everyone will join in the fight because it is only when we do it together that we can win the war against malaria,” he said. Dr. Adah said that sleeping under insecticide treated mosquito nets every night could reduce the malaria burden by 50 percent. He said that people need to get tested when they feel that they have malaria, adding that the number of malaria cases in health facilities is on the decline. He said preventive measures against malaria using the integrated environmental management method include using insecticide treated mosquito nets, and not allowing mosquito to breed in our environment by getting rid of stagnant water. The Power Forward project is a youth life skills and public health knowledge development programme which uses basketball as the convening platform to deploy its objectives. It is funded by the ExxonMobil Foundation and is implemented across 10 secondary schools in the Federal Capital Territory by Africare in partnership with the Nigeria Basketball Association (NBA).
