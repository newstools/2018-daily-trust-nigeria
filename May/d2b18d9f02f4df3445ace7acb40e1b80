Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has reaffirmed the commitment of his administration toward the fight against corruption in the state. A statement by Malam Abba Anwar, Chief Press Secretary to the Governor issued on Tuesday in Kano, said Ganduje made the remark at the graduation ceremony of postgraduate students of the Anti-Corruption Academy of Nigeria (ICPC), in Keffi, Nassarawa State. He said his administration would continue to prioritise the fight against corruption which had been identified as the bane of development in the country. According to him, the state government would also continue to support the anti-graft agency with a view to enabling it to discharge its responsibilities effectively. The governor, who was represented at the occasion by the Head of Service, Alhaji Muhammad Awwal-Na’iya, however, said the pursuit of this cardinal objective required collaborative efforts between the Federal, States and local governments. “We must tackle this menace to ensure good governance through prudent management of resources, transparency and accountability. “The meaningful development projects and programmes are made possible through blocking of leakages and optimum utilisation of the meager resources, as opposed to what was obtained in the past,’’ he said. The governor urged the participants to make the best use of the knowledge they acquired to ensure the success of the crusade in the state and the country at large. In his remarks, the Chairman of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-corruption Commission, Mr Muhiyi Magaji, reiterated his commitment to build a strong institution. He pledged to continue to give priority attention to training and retraining of staff of the commission, in addition to providing adequate facilities to enhance their performance. A staff of the state Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, Isa Mansur-Bello, emerged the best student in the recently-concluded one month training programme at the Academy. (NAN)
