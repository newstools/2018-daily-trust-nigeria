Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai has described the success of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Saturday’s elections as a referendum on the programmes of his administration. The governor, in a statement issued while the complete results of the elections were being awaited, said though issues arose in some places the people deserved gratitude for the maturity with which they participated in the elections. El-Rufai said the Kaduna State Government invested in Electronic Voting Machines at a considerable cost to promote electoral integrity and transparency. “Following the successful performance of the machines, Kaduna State is prepared to make its Electronic Voting Machines available to any state government that wishes to embrace electronic voting, on terms to be agreed,” he said. The governor said there were talks that people would punish the APC government at the polls for taking consequential decisions in favour of ordinary people but the people have denounced the selfish claims. “Our party has won a great victory. We salute those who voted for us. We did not win every local government, although we campaigned hard to do well everywhere. And having worked hard to make our case to the people, we respect the views of those who chose differently,” he said. The governor said it is hoped that the newly elected officials will run the councils in an inspiring, new way.
