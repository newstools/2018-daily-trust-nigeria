The Northern States Pentecostal Bishop’s Forum of Nigeria yesterday called on President Buhari to end the killings in the country, if he wants to return for a second term. The Chairman of the forum, Archbishop John Praise Daniel, who was speaking during a press briefing on the State of the Nation to commemorate the 2018 Democracy Day, noted that if the killings were not stopped it would have ‘dire electoral consequences’. The press briefing, which held at the Dominion Chapel Abuja had 14 other bishops in attendance. The bishops also urged government to ensure the release of Leah Sharibu, the remaining Dapchi school girl still in Boko Haram captivity.
