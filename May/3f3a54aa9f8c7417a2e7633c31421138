Iran has called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “liar” after he accused the country of deceiving the world about its nuclear intentions. Mr Netanyahu produced what he said were copies of Iranian files detailing a project to build nuclear weapons, which was reportedly mothballed 15 years ago. Iran said it had never sought to build a bomb when it signed an international deal to curb nuclear activity in 2015. Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi described Mr Netanyahu as an “infamous liar who has had nothing to offer except lies and deceits”. His accusations, he continued, were “worn-out, useless and shameful”. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the documents produced by Israel were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog.
