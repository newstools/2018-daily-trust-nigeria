German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkey’s foreign minister have put aside recent diplomatic tensions to mark the 25th anniversary of one of post-war Germany’s worst hate crimes. They met survivors at a memorial. On 29 May 1993 Neo-Nazis firebombed the home of a Turkish-German family in Solingen, killing two women and three girls. Bilateral ties have been in crisis over differences on human rights and a German ban on Turkish poll campaigning. The German Foreign Ministry banned Turkish politicians from campaigning in the country ahead of the 24 June election, citing a rule excluding non-EU dignitaries from campaign events in Germany without federal approval. Also, since Turkey’s failed 2016 coup, Germany has complained about a crackdown on opposition there, while Turkey has accused its Nato partners in Europe of harbouring coup plotters. Merkel said her country had a special responsibility to fight racism and xenophobia, particularly in light of its Nazi past.
