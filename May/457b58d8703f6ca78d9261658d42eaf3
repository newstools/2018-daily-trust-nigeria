Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara said security agencies would be held responsible should anything happen to Senator Dino Melaye. Dogara said at yesterday plenary that the rule of law must be followed in handling the Melaye issue, wondering why “The police would take him to court in a stretcher.” The speaker, who spoke after a member, Sunday Karimi (PDP, Kogi) raised a point of order on personal explanation about Dino’s travails, said security agencies should call their men to order. “All I can say is that the rule of law should prevail. They should know that prosecution can only be done when the person is alive. If anything happens to him, the security agents will be held responsible. I don’t see anywhere that a person is arraigned on stretcher,” he said. Karimi had said Melaye was taken to Lokoja on a stretcher in continuation of “Persecution by the state because of his political belief. “As a House, we shouldn’t sit down and do nothing. It is Dino today; it could me any of us tomorrow.” But Dogara responded by saying the matter was being handled by the Senate and did not allow members to contribute, as Karimi came under personal explanation, which the House rules bar debate in such situation.
