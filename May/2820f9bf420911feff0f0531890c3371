U.S. President Donald Trump has confirmed that his meeting with North  Korea’s leader Kim Jong-Un would take place in Singapore on June 12. Trump, who made the announcement on his Twitter handle said he and  Kim would “try to make it a very special moment for world peace”. The president said: “The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. “We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!” In a groundwork for the meeting between the two former arch-enemies  over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, three U.S. citizens were  on Wednesday released by North Korea and received on Thursday at  Washington DC by Trump. U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, had declined to announce the date and venue on Wednesday. Pompeo said: “We had a good day in the sense that I had a good and  lengthy conversation with Chairman Kim in preparation for the  President’s summit. “We are locked in on the date. We are locked in on the time. We’re not quite ready to announce either of those just yet. “But in relatively short order – we hope in the next handful of days –  we’ll be able to announce the location and the date and time. “But now that part is behind us for sure, and we had a chance to talk substantively about what we intend to be on the agenda. “And also how we’re going to begin to coordinate in the days ahead  between now and the summit in a way that we – both sides are confident  that we will set the conditions for a successful meeting between the two  leaders”. The secretary also said he could not say emphatically whether the meeting would last just a day or two. “So we’re planning on it will be a single day, but in the event that  there is more to discuss, there’ll be an opportunity for it to extend  into the second day as well,” Pompeo said.
