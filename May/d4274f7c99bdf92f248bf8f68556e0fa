A priest, Rev Fr Cornelius Koba, of the Sacred Heart Minor Seminary Jalingo, Sunday morning, escaped with a gunshot wound in an attack by gunmen suspected to herders. Speaking on the attack, the Catholic Bishop of Jalingo Diocese, Most Rev. Dr. Charles Hammawa, described the attack on the seminary as regrettable and urged government to be more serious in handling security issues in the country. “We thank God no life was lost in the incident, though my priest Rev. Fr. Cornelius Koba was shot in the leg. This is one attack too many. Fr. Koba had only told the Fulani herdsmen to stop grazing on the school premises and they came after him in the dead of the night,” he said. Narrating his ordeal, Rev Fr. Koba told journalists that the attackers stormed the seminary and headed to his room where he was attacked. “My offence is that I often ask them to stop invading our school for grazing and stop cutting down our trees to feed their cows,” he said. The Taraba State Police spokesperson, ASP David Misal, confirmed the attack but said no arrest was made yet.
