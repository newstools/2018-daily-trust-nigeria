Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha has said that his administration will launch an empowerment programme to be christened “My People, My People”. He said the essence of the programme is to further reduce poverty in the State to its barest minimum. The governor said this yesterday while inspecting some projects in Owerri and environs. He said in 2011 when he became governor, the poverty level in the state was 57 per cent, but by 2017, the level has come down to 19 per cent. “I will personally supervise the empowerment exercise. This will help some of our street traders to start a better life and we are targeting 50,000 people across the three zones of the state. This exercise will start between now and September. This will be my parting gift to Imo people,” he said.
