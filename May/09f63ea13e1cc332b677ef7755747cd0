The Lagos State Governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, has adopted as a son Fuad Adetoro Ogunsanya, who survived two eye surgeries to emerge the best graduating student of the Lagos State University (LASU) at yesterday’s 2017/2018 convocation ceremony. Ambode also announced he was giving Ogunsanya a sum of N5 million and a scholarship to study at any school of his choice anywhere in the world. Ogunsanya, who bagged 4.78 cumulative gross point (CGPA) in Business Administration, had in the valedictory speech narrated his rag-to-fame story. He also shared with the gathering how cataract affected his two eyes and he had to undergo two surgeries at the University of Ibadan Teaching Hospital (UCH) to correct the challenge. “My eye problems disrupted my academic pursuit for three years and I had to start all over again. I wanted to study Accounting, but when I applied to LASU I was admitted for Business Administration because I was told the Accounting programme had some issues at the time,” Ogunsanya said. Apparently moved by the graduand’s narration, Ambode announced he would be adopting him as a son. “Yours was a moving story. And because you are also the best graduating student, I will be giving you N5 million and a scholarship for further studies at any school of your choice,” the governor said. A total of 29,710 graduands participated in the convocation programme, with 201 for diplomas, 21, 481 for Bachelor’s degree programmes (regular and external), 7,982 for post-graduate programmes and 46 for doctorate. Thirty-six graduating students bagged First Class grades.
