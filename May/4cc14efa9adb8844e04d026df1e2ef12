A group, Coalition of Concerned Kwara Citizens, has backed the movement of suspected cultists from Kwara State to Abuja by the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, describing it as normal police investigation procedure. Members of the group, who staged a peaceful protest in Ilorin on Monday, said Senate President Bukola Saraki had nothing to fear about the movement of the culprits, adding that it was not the first criminal matter to be transferred from Kwara State to Abuja. Speaking with journalists, spokesperson of the group, Gbadeyan James, said diligent investigation and prosecution would help reveal sponsors of the culprits. “In the wake of 2003 election that ushered in the administration of Senator Saraki as governor, spurious allegations were made against some prominent Ilorin indigenes on plans to bomb Senator Saraki’s National Pilot newspaper office. The case was investigated by a senior police officer in the rank of DIG from Abuja and the matter was subsequently moved to Abuja. Similar cases that were transferred to Abuja from Kwara include the Fulani/vigilante group clashes in Alapa, Asa local government are of the state, the Offa poly students/OPC and Oro Ago Fulani/farmers crises were examples of cases that were transferred to Abuja”, he said. The group also called on the Chief Judge of Nigeria CJN to advise leadership of Kwara State judiciary not to allow itself to be used on matters that are outside its purview.
