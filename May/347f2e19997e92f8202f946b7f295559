Medical Doctors at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Katsina are converting some of their colleagues to provide services hitherto rendered by members of Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) to ensure patients are treated at the centre. A visit to the hospital by our correspondent shows that doctors now man the registry, labs and injection stations and attending to patients on ground. Speaking on the development, the Medical Director of FMC, Katsina, Dr. Suleiman Bello Mohammed, said despite the strike, the hospital is striving to provide service. “It may not be hundred percent, but at least the succour it will give to the patients is enormous,” he said Mohammed added that health service is a team work but in a situation where working together can’t be found, the doctors have to do others’ jobs to save lives, adding that “We don’t have problem with JOHESU.” The state chairman of Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) Dr. Muhammed Suleiman said the step down services by the doctors was not easy but challenging noting that “we are doing this for humanity and especially the poor people.”
