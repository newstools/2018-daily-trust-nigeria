At least two persons have been arrested in connection with the murder of a 44- year-old night guard, Kehinde Akinrele, in Abeokuta, Ogun State last week. This happened as wife of the slain night guard, identified as Mama Emma yesterday, cried out for justice on the killing, declaring that government should not allow her husband die in vain in course of serving the state. Kehinde, the Ife, Osun State-born member of the Ogun State government owned Vigilante Service was killed by some suspected armed robbers who stormed a popular filling station at Asero and carted away large sums of money. It was gathered that the robbers numbering about nine, had stormed the station at about 2.00a.m., overpowered the guard and smashed him with stones and machete several times until he died. He had resumed for duty on the fateful night of Sunday, only to discover that his partner, who was in possession of the station’s only firearm called to excuse himself from duty. The police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed two arrests have been made in connection with the incident, “but, we are still investigating before bringing them to the public. I can assure that there is no sweeping under the carpet of such dastardly act,” he said. However, Mrs. Akinrele in a chat with our correspondent yesterday demanded for justice on the killers of her husband, saying her husband should not die in vain. The remains of deceased have been buried at his house which was still under construction at Obada area of Abeokuta last Wednesday.
