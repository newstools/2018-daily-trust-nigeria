Suspected Mumuye youths have killed two Fulani youths at Anguwan Alkali village of Yorro Local Government Area of Taraba State. The killing came few days after six Fulani were allegedly killed by the Mumuye at Malale village in the same area. Daily Trust gathered that the killing of six Fulani happened after a herdsman allegedly damaged the mobile phone of a Mumuye woman. The woman raised the alarm even after the herdsman had agreed to replace the phone. The Mumuye youths surrounded the Fulani village and killed four youths and two elderly persons. A combined team of soldiers and police was drafted to the area but the suspected masterminds of the killings were said to be on the run. The remains of the six persons killed were buried in Jalingo while bodies of the two killed Sunday were yet to be recovered. A resident of Malale, Mustapha Hamman, said the attack was unprovoked as it was not a resident that damaged the Mumuye woman’s phone, adding that their only offence was being Fulani. The Special Assistant on Media Matters to Taraba State Governor Darius Ishaku, Mr Bala Dan Abu, when contacted, said he was not aware of the killings. “Who killed who? I am not aware,” Dan Abu said. When contacted, the Taraba State Police Spokesman, ASP David Misal, confirmed the killing of six Fulani in Yorro last Wednesday but said he was not aware of the killing of two more in the area. He said five persons have been arrested over the killings.
