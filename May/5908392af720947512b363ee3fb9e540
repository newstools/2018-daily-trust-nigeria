The Lagos State Governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, has enjoined Muslims to extend love to others and imbibe the act of selfless service to humanity during and after Ramadan, saying such a disposition would go a long way in producing a better Nigeria. In the same vein, the Baba Adinni of Yewaland, Ogun State, Abiodun Akinlade, has enjoined Nigerians, particularly Muslims in Ogun State, to pray for the country and the state during the Ramadan period and beyond. Ambode made his call at the Ramadan Tafsir held at the Lagos State Government House to mark the official commencement of the Islamic fasting month. The governor urged those who have been blessed by Allah to express their gratitude by helping others and exhibiting total submission to God’s commandments. He added that since assuming office, his administration’s guiding philosophy had been about inclusion and to positively touch lives, and admonished Muslims to follow suit by imbibing the spirit of giving selflessly to others at all times. “There are people who are suffering, which is why we do projects that are people-oriented. That is why we go to areas that have never been touched before. That is the whole essence of why Allah has brought us on earth. “God did not say we should come and acquire resources. He did not say we should come and acquire wealth. He says we should come and serve Him and we should serve Him selflessly. That is the philosophy of our government and that is what we have been preaching ever since I came into office,” Ambode said. Akinlade, a governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, said the holy month should be seen as an opportunity to learn self-restraint, love, piety and sacrifice. The former three-term member of the House of Representatives for Yewa South/Ipokia Federal Constituency, called on the well-endowed in the society to extend charities to the less-privileged during the holy month and after it.
