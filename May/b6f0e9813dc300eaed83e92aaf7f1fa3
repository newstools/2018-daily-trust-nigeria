The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly,  Mudashiru Obasa, has advised Nigerian children to avoid cultism and other crimes that can work against their progress in life. Obasa also advised the children to be good ambassadors of not only their families and communities but also the country at large. In a statement he issued yesterday to commemorate the Children’s Day celebration, signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak, the Speaker assured Nigerian children that the All Progressives Congress  (APC) at all levels would continue to protect their interest by putting in place programmes and policies that would enhance their welfare and improve their standard of living. “However, I want to advise you to shun violence. Avoid cultism, run away from crimes. The only way you can make progress in life is by being good ambassadors of your country, and you can only achieve this by exhibiting high moral values all the time,” Obasa said. He urged parents to monitor the activities of their children with a view to nipping in the bud any desire by them to go into crime. “It’s our duty as parents and guardians to monitor the activities of our children all the time. It’s imperative for us to know the friends they keep and hang out with, and the groups they associate with,” he said.
