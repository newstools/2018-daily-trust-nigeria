The National Secretary of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Alh. Shehu Gabam, has assured the Nigerian youth that it will return Nigeria to the period when governments appreciated the importance of the children as the future leaders. 

Gabam, who gave the assurance on Sunday while addressing a group of SDP members' children who visited him at his Abuja home, condemned the current situation where the development of the children was rarely given priority in the nationâ€™s budget.

He said that the paltry 7.04 per cent of the 8.6 trillion 2018 budget allocated to education by the Muhammadu Buhari administration was far from the 26 per cent recommended by the United Nations.

The SDP scribe stressed that the development amounted to insensitivity of the government to the role of children's education in nation building. 

He said the anticipated government of the SDP would put the issues of youth development in the front burner.
