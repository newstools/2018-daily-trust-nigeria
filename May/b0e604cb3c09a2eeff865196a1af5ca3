The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, has ordered the immediate deployment of 200 additional policemen to Kaduna and Zamfara states to protect parts of the two states constantly attacked by bandits. Speaking in Birnin Gwari, Kaduna State yesterday during a town hall meeting with stakeholders from communities there, the IGP also announced that an area command and two additional divisional police stations would be created around Birnin-Gwari and 10 patrol vehicles provided for operation. The police boss said the move was to curtail the security challenges in the Birnin-Gwari axis of Kaduna State. “We have to increase police presence along the road from Zamfara  to Birnin Gawri. We believe some of the challenges are emanating from these areas. By the time we dominate the road with great synergy with other security operatives, we are going to move to this area to flush out the bandits,” he said, appealing for information to aid the task of policing the place. “The police can only succeed with your support; you live here and we will want you to provide information that will help them to discharge their duty,” he said. Responding, the Emir of Birnin-Gwari, Alhaji Jubrin Zubairu Mai Gwari II , called on the IG to help recover the old Birnin-Gwari town from the bandits, as the town was a historical site that must not be left in the hands of bandits.
