The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development yesterday said it was not involved in the procurement of relief materials, mainly food, worth N5.8 billion for victims of insurgency in the Northeast. The ministry told the House of Representatives Committee on Disaster and Emergency Preparedness in Abuja that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) may have decided to engage contractors for the relief materials based on reasons best known to it. The panel is investigating allegations of lack of transparency and public trust in the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). The director of food and strategy in the agric ministry, S. A. Haruna, who represented the minister, Aude Ogbeh, said his ministry did not attend any meeting concerning Federal Government grains programmes. “Our mandate is to keep Federal Government’s stock, but on this, it appears CBN decided to engage four companies. So, I will say we are not aware,” he said. The committee led by the deputy chairman, Ali Isa (PDP, Gombe) directed CBN, the Accountant General of the Federation ( AGF ) and NEMA to furnish it with details of the 5000 metric tonnes of food grains said to have been sold to the World Food Programme (WFP). They are also to provide details of the amount realized from the sale and its custody. Also, the panel directed the Director General of NEMA, Mustapha Maihaja, to appear before it unfailingly on May 31 to respond to some questions.
