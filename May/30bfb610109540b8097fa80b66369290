The embattled chairman of Kwali chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Yahaya Aliyu Sheda, has protested last Saturday’s area council congress which replaced him with Ayuba Saleh Sheda. Aliyu, who spoke with newsmen after the party’s congress, which was carried out through affirmation in Kwali, alleged that the council chairman, Joseph Shazhin, had interest in the election of the party executives. He said that stakeholders held a meeting two days before the congress and resolved that all the party executives should be returned elected, saying he wondered why a new party chairman was announced at the venue. “I am not satisfied with the outcome of the congress and the truth is that the chairman has interest and I don’t believe in his interest because the party is greater than any individual,” he said. The embattled party chairman said he would wait for the outcome of the congress appeal committee which had assured him that it would look into the matter. “Besides, this is a guided congress as there were no ballot papers and we were all told that everybody should be returned as executive of the party,” he added. Reacting, the council chairman, Joseph Shazin, said the change of the party chairman was based on zoning arrangement as agreed by the Gbagyi indigenes in the area. “The zoning arrangement was that we have tribal arrangement and ward arrangement, in which the position of the party chairman was zoned to Gbagyi, while all other positions go to other tribes,” he said. The chairman said the decision in zoning the party’s chairman was a unanimous one among the party stakeholders, which he said was in order to make the 2019 election very easy and successful.
