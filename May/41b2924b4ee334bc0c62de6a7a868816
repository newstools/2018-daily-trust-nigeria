A family of six, including a nine-year-old girl, were behind a wave of blasts targeting three churches in Indonesiaâ€™s second city of Surabaya, police say. At least 13 people were killed and dozens injured in the attacks. The mother and two daughters blew themselves up at a church, while the father and two sons targeted two others, according to police. Police chief Tito Karnavian said the family belonged to an Indonesian IS-inspired network, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). The father drove a bomb-laden car into the grounds of Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church, police said. The mother and her two daughters - aged 9 and 12 - had bombs strapped to them and blew themselves up at Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church.
