The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has urged former president Olusegun Obasanjo to stop name-calling and answer the simple question of “where is the power after the $16bn your government spent on power projects in Nigeria?” A statement jointly signed by chairman of BMO, Hon. Austin Braimoh and Secretary, Chief Cassidy Madueke, said yesterday in Abuja  that while they acknowledged the detailed information provided by Chief Obasanjo in his response to a query raised by President Muhammadu Buhari on the issue, the lengthy communication still failed to address where the power was. “Nigerians may be many things, but they are not fools. They would definitely have been able to tell if the $16bn allocated to power projects was actually expended as proposed. Even the poorest mathematicians among us would have been able to calculate the disbursement of that amount in the increased number of hours per day their light bulbs, television sets and refrigerators stayed on. It would have been impossible to not feel the impact of the $16 billion dollars on power, if the money had actually been spent on power. “Chief Obasanjo exculpates himself by referring to probes and investigations which found him blameless. But, the fact remains that the invisible $16bn power projects took place under his watch,” the group said.
