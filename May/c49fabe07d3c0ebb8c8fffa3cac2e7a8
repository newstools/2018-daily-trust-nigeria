A woman, simply identified as Folashade, has converted a bus stop behind Kontagora Estate, on Market Road, to a shop. Our reporter, who visited the area on Tuesday, gathered from residents that the bus stop was built some years ago by the government for passengers alighting from vehicles or those waiting to board vehicles to take shelter. A resident, who owns a shop close to the bus stop, Isaac Emmanuel, said the bus stop was taken over by the woman, who he said is an immigration officer, since November last year. He said the woman engaged a man who resides at Kontagora Estate to supervise the conversion of the bus stop. Another resident, Aliyu Ibrahim, said he was surprised to discover that the bus stop was converted into a shop. “In fact, even when it is raining, passengers who alight at the bus stop will not have anywhere to shelter from the rain,” he said. Ibrahim said though some officials from the area council later came to mark the ‘stop work’ order on the ‘shop’ the woman still continued with the re construction work. “She actually stopped work after the building was marked, until a month later when she came with some of her colleagues who sat there until the work was  finished,” he said.
