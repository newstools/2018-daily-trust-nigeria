Meghan, the Duchess Sussex, chose a modest white bridal gown designed by Givenchy’s Clare Waight Keller for her wedding to Britain’s Prince Harry at St George’s Chapel in Windsor. The ivory silk dress was modern and feminine, with a shoulder-framing bateau neckline, simple A-line silhouette, and slim three-quarter sleeves. The train was short, stopping well before the 16.5-foot silk tulle veil, which was hand-embroidered with flora representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth. The designer of the wedding dress had been a closely guarded secret for months. While she was not considered a forerunner, British Waight Keller seemed a fitting choice for Meghan, who identifies as a feminist. She made history last year when it was announced she would be replacing Riccardo Tisci as Givenchy’s artistic director. Today, the 47-year-old is one of few women at the helm of a Parisian fashion house. At her previous post as creative director of Chloé, she championed a free-spirited, feminine aesthetic that prioritized soft colors, elegance and ease. At Givenchy, she’s taken a darker and cinematic turn -- a nod to Tisci’s particularly Gothic legacy.
