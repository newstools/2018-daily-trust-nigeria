Beside the slain students, properties were also destroyed during the crisis which arose over restriction of the students to some areas of the ancient town. Yesterday’s programme, which was tagged ‘May 8 Symposium on Peace; We Are Better Together’, was aimed at ensuring that peace reigns in Offa and  eighbouring communities with a view to ensuring that people live together peacefully. The president of the Alumni Association, Mr Ayo Adeyemi, said at the occasion that the purpose of the gathering was to bring everybody together and forget the ugly incidents of the past. “Let me say here that this gathering is meant to celebrate freedom, peace and unity in Offa. Also, it is an opportunity for Offa people to be part of the students’ lives and regard them as theirs,” Adeyemi said. He announced that the programme would be an annual event, where issues of importance to the students, the community, Kwara State and Nigeria generally would be discussed and solutions proffered to challenging issues. Also, the school’s Students’ Union president, Comrade Ojajuni E. Oluwasomidotun, eulogised students he said laid down their lives for others to enjoy the freedom there is today, and appealed to the Alumni Association to hold talks with officials of the National Union of Road Transport Workers on considering reduction of transport fares for students.
