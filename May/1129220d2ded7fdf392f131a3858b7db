The Women and Youth Empowerment Initiatives, a Non governmental Organizations (NGO), has trained 1000 tricyclists on how to collaborate with security operatives in the fight against drugs abuse and Boko haram insurgency. The Executive Director of the initiative, Hajia Husna Ibrahim, who spoke at a five day training workshop in Gaidam, said the programme was to check violence extremism in war ravage areas of Yobe and Northeast. Ibrahim noted that the participants have received various training on peace building by way of exposing dens of drugs addicts to security operatives and obeying traffic rules and regulations to avoid breakdown of law. "The resource persons were drawn from the Nigeria Army, the Police, Federal Road Safety Corps and the Academia. They were also given opportunity for interactive session where questions were raised on grey areas and how best to work together to fight the insurgency. "This had also allowed the participants to share ideas on how best to rid the society of the menace of drugs abuse, traffic accidents and maintain peace", she said. She called on the participants to make the best use of the programme in the development of the society, themselves and the country as a whole. The programme Manager of the initiative, Mr Musa Ezekiel, described the tricyclist as peace ambassadors that should encourage mutual understanding with security agencies to promote peaceful coexistence in the state. "I advised that you should be mindful of things that will truncate peace in their society and the nation as a whole" he added. Also, the chairman, Gaidam Local Government Area,Â  Mulima Idi-Mato, thanked the organization for the sensitization programme, while hoping that the training would change the culture of tricycle ridders within the community and environs for the better.   "I believed this campaign and many more will no doubt curb insurgency in Gaidam, the state and the country as a whole" he added.
