The Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Hameed Ali, said Nigerians complaining of hunger are lazy. Ali said this at the Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday when he led members of the Buhari Support Organization to a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. He said, “Last year, during the Hajj period when I went home, many farmers came to me that they have never had it so good so much so that the first 25 people that paid up their money when Hajj fare was announced were rice farmers. What more can we say in terms of growth of wealth. “People say we are hungry.  Of course, the lazy must be hungry because if you do not work hard, Manna doesn’t fall from heaven. So, when people say we’re hungry. There was never a time in Nigeria that food is dropped in the mouth of the people and they can never be. “I can go on and on and enumerate what you’ve done in just three years of your administration, but three is not enough to undo what was done in 16 years. The destruction, the monumental stealing that we’ve witnessed, the destruction of our structures and our system, it takes more than eight years to be able to address them and I believe in three years, you’ve done wonderfully well.” Ali said his group was solidly in support of Buhari’s second term bid because of his integrity, honesty and love for the nation. “I’ve said it and I’ll repeat it here Mr President with all due respect, at 70 plus, with good retirement benefits and with your house in Daura, if I were you, I’d see no reason to be in this arena. But why are you here? It’s because you love this great country. You left your comfort to serve Nigeria and that’s why for those of us, who love you for who you’re said we must follow you and ensure that your second term in this country becomes a reality,” Ali said.
