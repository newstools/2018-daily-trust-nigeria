Brazilian President Michel Temer has lowered the price of diesel in a bid to end a truckers’ strike that has crippled the country for almost a week. Mr Temer said the price would be cut by 46 Brazilian cents ($0.13; £0.09) per litre. He said the new price would be maintained for 60 days and adjusted monthly thereafter. Striking truckers have blockaded main roads across the country and defied Mr Temer’s threats to send the army in. “We have done our part to ease the problems and suffering,” Mr Temer said in a televised address. It was not clear if striking drivers would accept his offer. Diesel prices in Brazil have nearly doubled since 2016.
