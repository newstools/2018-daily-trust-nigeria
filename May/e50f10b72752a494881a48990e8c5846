Having scored one of the best goals of all time you would have expected Zinedine Zidane to have something to say to Gareth Bale.
        
But no, the Real Madrid boss snubbed the two-goal Welshman for the second time at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev.

Bale was gutted to be left out of the starting side by the France legend and responded, when he came on 61st minute, in the most spectacular way imaginable.

His stunningly acrobatic overhead kick three minutes later, from Marcelo’s cross, temporarily silenced the packed stadium.

It was that good you couldn’t quite believe what you had just witnessed.

Zidane put a hand on his bald head as he too looked amazed but bizarrely gave the former Tottenham star the silent treatment after Madrid secured their 13th Champions League success.

Bale, who did not come out to warm up with his team-mates before kick-off, was asked if Zidane had spoken to him after the trophy presentation.

The £85m star shook his head to spark more disbelief.

“So he has not spoken to you, he’s said nothing?” he was pressed. “No,” came the 28-year-old’s reply.

Then Bale, with his fourth Champions League medal around his neck, was off.
