Senator Danjuma Goje and his daughter Fatima have been ordered by an Abuja Upper Area Court to appear before it on May 17 to swear an oath in a matter bordering on child custody. The plaintiff, Abubakar Faruk, former son-in-law of Goje, who is also the Managing Director of Abuja Market Management Limited approached the court seeking an order directing the lawmaker and his daughter to show for the administration of the oath, which will take place at an Abuja mosque. The defendants are to swear by the Holy Qur’an that they did not take the plaintiff’s daughter to the United Kingdom, as he alleged. Faruk, who is also son of first military governor of North-Western State from 1967 to 1975,  Alhaji Usman Faruk, had approached the court seeking an order compelling Goje, and ex-wife Fatima to return his daughter from London, to enable her continue her studies in Nigeria. At the resumed hearing yesterday, counsel to the plaintiff, Mohammed Shuaib, told the court that it would not be possible for the plaintiff to bring witnesses because they all may have been “compromised.” On his part, counsel to the defendants, Adah Usman, urged the court to allow him seek the consent of the lead counsel to the defendants on the plaintiff’s application, but Justice Bello turned down Usman’s prayer and ordered that the defendants appear in court on May 17 for the administration of the oath.
