The Chairman of Abuja Muncipal  Area Council (AMAC), Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu Candido,  has warned youths not to allow themselves to be used as political thugs. He said there would be no development in an atmosphere  of violence in any given society. Candido stated this in a lecture titled ‘Development as the Only Alternative to Political Thuggery And Violence’ organised by the Directorate of Conflict Resolution and Interfaith Matters in collaboration with the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) in Kwali at the weekend. He said the destiny of every Nigerian youth remained in their hands and  advised them to utilise it wisely. Also speaking at the event, the  president of NYCN, Comrade Murtala Muhammed Garba, said recent comments by President Muhammadu Buhari on the Nigerian youths  should be seen as a wakeup call rather than criticism. On his part, the organiser of the event, who is also the  director, Conflict Resolution and Interfaith Matters directorate of NYCN, Abubakar Sadiq Ahmad, said the programme was to enlighten the political class on the importance of development in democracy.
