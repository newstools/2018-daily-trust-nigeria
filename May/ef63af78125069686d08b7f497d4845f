Nigerian civil society organizations yesterday honoured three Pan African gender activists for their selfless services to people across Africa. Tajudeen Abdulraheem, Winnie  Madikizela Mandela and Prof Abubakar Momoh were said to share a common link of courage, conviction, struggle, and giving back to humanity in their lifetimes. The memorial lecture, with the theme ‘Pan African Liberation: The Emancipation of Women and the Humanisation of the Male’ in honour of the three renowned activists was organised by the Women’s Rights Advancement and Protection Alternative (WRAPA) in collaboration with other Civil Society Organisations with support from the McArthur Foundation. The chairperson of the occasion, WRAPA Secretary General, Saudatu Mahdi, in her address, said they would never forget the three icons that Nigeria and Africa had lost but with history and constant reminder of what they stood, they provided hope for the continent and its people. She said his call  for purposeful engagement that saw him traversing national boundaries to dialogue with African leaders was being emulated in the productive engagement of the Nigerians in the National Assembly  where they are facing the ‘Not Too Young To Rule’ demand. Mahdi added that Winnie Mandela’s resilient faith provided an inspiration while her contributions to the dislodgment of apartheid would serve as a motivation and the possibility of dislodging patriotic gender discrimination in  private and public lives in Nigeria. “The sweetest thing would have been for Momoh to hear that in the midst of the confusion preceding electioneering campaigns in Nigeria for 2019 election, there is an emerging wind of accountability that will shape voters’ candidate formation,” she said. In his lecture, Prof Horace Campbell said, “We must use the moment in African Day to sum up what is going on with Africans all over the world,” adding that the revolution cannot triumph without the emancipation of women.
