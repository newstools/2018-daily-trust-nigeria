The medical service, which was part of activities  to commemorate the Navy’s 62nd Anniversary, saw 2000 IDPs in Kuchingoro Camp, Abuja, benefiting from different services such as blood pressure checks, eye examination,  issuance of free eye glasses,  as well as de-worming of children and adults. Speaking at the event, the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ete-Ibas, said it was the Navy’s corporate social responsibility meant to enhance healthy civil-military relationship.
