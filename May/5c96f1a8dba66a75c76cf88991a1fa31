The police in Lagos have smashed a two-man syndicate they said specialised in swindling members of the public while pretending to be bank officials. The suspects, 25-year-old Enohomfoh Osagie Favour and Ebong Christopher, were arrested after they had allegedly swindled some persons of huge sums running into many millions of naira. City News gathered that the suspects were arrested based on series of complaints from victims complaining that they received telephone calls from the suspects asking for their Bank Verification Number (BVN) ostensibly to enable them rectify errors on their accounts. The Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who yesterday briefed journalists on the arrest, said that the suspects were members of a notorious syndicate of fraudsters who specialised in calling unsuspecting members of the public, particularly public servants, pretending to be bank officials and demanding for the bank accounts and ATM details of their would-be victims. Edgal said, “On April 19, 2018, the command received a complaint from a staff of Neighbourhood Safety Corps who said he was called by the gang requesting his account number and ATM details. “Investigation into the case led to the arrest of Enohomfoh Osagie Faviour, a 2015 Parasitology and Entomology graduate of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State and Ebong Christopher, a 2016 Computer Science graduate of Tansian University, Oba, Anambra State.” He said that the suspects had confessed to the crime.
