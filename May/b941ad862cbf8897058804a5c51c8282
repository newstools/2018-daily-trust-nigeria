The father of four children found shot dead along with their mother in rural Western Australia has pointed the finger of blame at their grandfather. Aaron Cockman said he believed that Peter Miles, 61, had not “snapped” but had been “thinking this through for a long time”. The bodies of Miles, his wife Cynda, daughter Katrina and four grandchildren were found in Osmington on Friday. Police have said they are not looking for any other suspects. They have not confirmed the identity of the killer but say they believe him to be among the dead. Three long firearms found at the property were licensed to Mr Miles, they say.
