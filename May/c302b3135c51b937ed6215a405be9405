As part of activities to commemorate the 2018 Democracy Day celebrations, President Muhammadu Buhari will on Tuesday, May 29, make a national broadcast at 7 am local time.

In a statement issued on Monday, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina urged television and radio stations across the country to hook up to the network services of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and Radio Nigeria for the broadcast.

It is expected that the Presidentâ€™s speech will touch on plans to sustain democracy in Nigeria as well as deliver more democratic dividends to citizens.

Recall that the Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) had on Sunday called on the President not to address Nigerians tomorrow, accusing him of not defending democracy in his three years in office.
