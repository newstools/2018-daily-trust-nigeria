The Lagos State Governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, has inaugurated the new Lagos Council of Obas and Chiefs, with the Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiolu, maintaining his position as Chairman. At the inauguration at the Lagos House in Alausa, Ikeja, Ambode charged the traditional rulers to work towards ensuring peace and security in their domains, while also working to correct anti-social behaviours in their communities. The governor urged members of the re-constituted council to justify the confidence reposed in them by using their wealth of experience to support his administration in the task of deepening democracy and bringing development to every part of the state, just as he restated his commitment to the welfare of royal fathers in the state.
