President of the forum, Comrade Abdulsalam Mohammed Kazeem in a statement said PMB's promised to sign the bill furthers shows his believed and trust on Nigeria Youths as the bill seeks to reduce the minimum age requirement for elective position in to different political offices.

He said, "We equally salute the efforts of the leadership of both chambers of the National Assembly for passing the bill with a special appreciation to Senator Abdulazeez Nyako of Adamawa state who sponsored and ensure the speedy passage of the bill in the Senate despite all odds.

"The Nigerian National Youth Policy (2009) defines a youths as those between the age of 18 -35 years,  though for our 19 years of un-interrupted democracy no administration both (past and present) has given us the needed opportunity to serve despite all our efforts (youth) at all level during the electioniary activities.   

"As at May 29, 2015 we have less than 10 people between the age of 18 – 35 in the house of representative which represent less that 4 per cent of over 360 representatives in the Green Chamber, and in the Senate no single individual  below the age bracket which represent 0%, while in the Executive the youngest was Kemi Adeosun (45 years ) and Audu Agbe remained the oldest over (70 years)." 

He noted that leadership has nothing to do with age rather, it comes with individual vision, Passion, Mission and Ability to drive Excellence. 

He added, "We strongly believed that most of us are competent enough to hold any public office including the highest public office (President) if for instance a 39 years old can be the president of France a super power nation, a 41 years old president of Belgium, a 28 and 32 years old Stephen Sang was elected Senator and Governor in Kenya in year 2013 and 2017 respectively, even  the president of North Korea Who seems to be threating the peace of the world is less than 33 years when he assumed office, while not a 35 years old as the president of Nigerian and a 30 or 32 years old governor of kaduna or Rivers state?'

"We call on all Nigerian youth to use the advantage of the promise made by Mr. President to seek for political offices at all level through decent and peaceful means intend of waiting for appointed as Technical Assistance, Personal Assistance, Special Advisers, Assistance without portfolio and other unproductive appointments."
