A heavy windstorm has wrecked havoc on some structures at the headquarters of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital. 

The windstorm which accompanied an early morning rain on Thursday  caused heavy destructions to the roofs of the Survey Department of NIWA and the Police station in the authority. 

The General Manager, Corporate Affairs of NIWA, Mr Tayo Fadile, who confirmed the incident said the office furniture and equipment in the affected structures had been evacuated. 

He however appealed to the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) to give NIWA an emergency approval to carry out repairs on the roofs of the affected structures to stop further destructions to the buildings especially now that the raining seasons are here.
