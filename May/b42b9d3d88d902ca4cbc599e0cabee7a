In continuation of the dialogue over the grievances of members of the new Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP) bloc of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), another meeting between the group and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will hold on Monday.

Attendees at the meeting are expected to meet President Muhammadu Buhari to intimate him about the outcome of their meeting.

The nPDP group led by a former Acting chairman of PDP, Alh Abubakar Baraje had last week met with the national body to discuss and possibly resolve their differences.

Baraje confirmed the planned meetings with the Vice President and the President Buhari to newsmen in Ilorin, Kwara state on Sunday.

Baraje expressed optimism that at the end of tomorrow's meeting with Osinbajo and Buhari, the ruling party will come out stronger and become more united in the general interest of the citizenry.

He said the next line of action of his group will be determined by theÂ  outcome of today's meeting.
