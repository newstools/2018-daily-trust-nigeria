US President Donald Trump says he will withdraw the US from an Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran. Calling it “decaying and rotten”, he said the deal was “an embarrassment” to him “as a citizen”. Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. In a statement, France, Germany and the UK - who are also signatories to the deal - have said they “regret” the American decision. The European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said the EU was “determined to preserve” the deal. The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years.
