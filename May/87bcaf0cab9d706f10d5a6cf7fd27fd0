 Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has donated N10 million to a hospital  where some survivors of recent bomb blast in Mubi are receiving treatment. Sneaking when he paid sympathy visit to the critically injured víctims of the blast who are receiving treatment at the Feferal Medical Centre Yola, Atiku condemned the attack in which at least 28 people died and 56 others were injured on 1st May. He described the condition of the victims as devastating, stressing the need for increased vigilance to prevent such deadly incidents in the future. Atiku suggested for mass recruitment of police men to match the rising security challenges in the country, saying the current recruitment drive was not enough. "I don't think we have enough security personnel. We need more police men because they should be at the forefront," he stated. "When I was in government, we had a policy of recruiting 50,000 police men every month and we did that for a number of months", he added. The former vice president kicked against use of military in providing internal security as that undermined police role. The PDP presidential aspirant therefore commended the management of FMC Yola for setting up the Paupers Fund to sponsor treatment of poor patients. "We set up the Paupers Fund in this hospital. I donated N10 million at the beginning. I am satisfied with the way the fund is being managed and today I have donated additional N10 million", Atiku stated. In his response, the Medical Director of the hospital, Professor Awwal Abubakar saidt the fund had assisted 300 patients since its establishment a few years ago. He said the fund was being managed by a committee while the hospital management had no access to the fund to ensure transparency.
