A Middle Belt pressure group, the Middle Belt Rights Congress (MBRC) has urged security agencies to investigate and arrest all political components and sponsors of killer herdsmen terrorizing the region.

General Secretary of the group, Moses Ogaba Ochapa said going after the sponsors and the political components of those that have flooded the Middle Belt with blood was the only way to end the killings.

In a statement made available to our correspondent, the group described as commendable, the ability of the Nigerian Army to rise above various political distractions and unnecessary criticisms to tackle the incessant killings in the country, especially in the middle belt region. The group also commended the Chief of Army staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai for his on the spot visits to remote communities in Benue state, saying such action has indeed served as morale booster to the troops.

Ochapa said the successes being recorded by the army were crucial to save the country of food crisis since many farming communities are unable to plant crops while "demented" killers rampage through the land.

According to him, this is the reason why the army must be encouraged to sustain the tempo of capturing the troublers of Nigeria's peace and bring them to justice.
