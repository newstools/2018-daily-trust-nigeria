Corruption is the major reason for drug abuse in Nigeria, says Dr Hope Abraham one of the leaders of the Volunteer Group against Tramadol Abuse (V-GATA). Abraham made this statement Tuesday during a Daily Trust TV, Live streaming session in Abuja He said “Corruption is the major reason for the abuse of tramadol in Nigeria. The government should heighten their fight against corruption, not just in monetary aspect but in our regulatory agencies that should check the use of these drugs.” He added that the drug which is very popular among the youths was ravaging them. “Tramadol is actually ravaging the youths and even adults and the elderly ones.” “Sometimes we discover that some of these tramadol have expired but people still sell and buy them”, he stated. Also speaking during the live streaming on the side effects of the drug, Pharmacist Ikenna Ifiora said there were two effects of taking the drug “Confusion and slight headache are adverse effects of taking Tramadol. So these are some side effects are what the addicts are look forward to.” He stated that when taken over a very long time, one becomes dependent on it and once they can’t have access to it, they behave erratic and they go different doctors, complaining of different symptoms so that they could be prescribed that particular drug. “We also have to engage the Federal Ministry of Health and the ministry of youth on this matter”, he added. After the May 1st ban on the use of codeine, a substance found in cough syrups, Nigerians welcomed the move and also added that the ban should be extended to Tramadol, a pain-relieving drug which has also been abused extensively.
