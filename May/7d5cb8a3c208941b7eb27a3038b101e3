Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has begun a diplomatic tour to seek assurances that signatories to a landmark nuclear deal will back it despite its abandonment by the US. Mr Zarif said on his first stop, China, that he hoped to secure a “clear future design” for the agreement. The US will re-impose sanctions on Iran and firms dealing with it could be hit, angering signatories like France. After meeting his counterpart in Beijing, Mr Zarif said: “We hope that with this visit to China and other countries we will be able to construct a clear future design for the comprehensive agreement.” But he added: “If the nuclear deal is to continue, the interests of the people of Iran must be assured.” He will later head to Moscow and Brussels.
