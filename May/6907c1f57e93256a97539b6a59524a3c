A medical team from Nisa Premier Hospital, Jabi, Abuja,  in collaboration with Baby Hannatu Foundation, has carried out medical outreach at Vine Heritage Home Foundation in Kuje, FCT. The group also donated food items to the home as part of celebrations to mark Children’s Day. Head of the medical team, Dr. Doris Izuwah, said the hospital identified the home because of the humanitarian acts carried out by the proprietor. “We have heard about how Vine Heritage Home Foundation has rescued children that ordinarily would have died. So we are here to donate food items and under our medical outreach, we will access the children, immunise them and give them drugs as well as treat skin infections for those suffering from such,” she said. In his response, the proprietor of the home, Stevens Olusola, said for over a decade they had consulted with over 62 communities of the FCT where the cultural belief of segregating children born with disabilities still existed. “In the early 1990s when we came to the FCT, we discovered that in some communities albinos, twins and those born with disabilities were endangered so what we did was to rescue them and nurture them and that led to the rescue of the first baby in 1996 when the home started,” he added.
