The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige has urged the striking members of the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) to obey an order of the National Industrial Court directing it to call off the strike action within 24 hours and return to negotiation. The minister made the appeal in a statement issued by the Director of Press in the Ministry, Samuel Olowookere. Ngige said information from field officers of the ministry indicates that the unions were yet to comply with the court order. “Information from our various field officers indicates that JOHESU is yet to obey the order of the National Industrial Court, which directed it to call off the strike within 24 hours and return to negotiation with effect from May 17, 2018.” The minister said disobedience to court orders is “An anarchic resort to self-help which will neither benefit the unions nor the nation at large,” adding that orders of court no matter how adverse must be obeyed until set aside. “I hereby appeal to the leaders and members of JOHESU to comply with this order and direct their members nationwide to return to duties immediately.  This is in view of the imperative of the rule of law as well as give and take upon which every fruitful social dialogue is anchored,” he said. The minister noted that a high level Federal Government body had been meeting on daily basis, since the commencement of the strike to find an amicable resolution of the contending issues, majorly, the review of the CONHESS salary level for the five unions.
