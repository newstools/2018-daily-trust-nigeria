At least 16 people have been killed in southern Afghanistan when security forces tried to dispose of a container full of explosives in the city of Kandahar, officials said. Nematullah Barak, head of Mirwais hospital in Kandahar, said the latest figures “show 16 dead and 38 wounded people brought to the hospital”. “We still have two ambulances at the site because there might be more people under the rubble,” he told AFP news agency. Daud Ahmadi, spokesman for the provincial governor, confirmed the death toll and said four security forces were among those killed.
