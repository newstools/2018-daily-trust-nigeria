The Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, has assured the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) of a communal clash in Toto Local Government of Nasarawa State of safety, promising them food and shelter. Ajiya, while addressing the IDPs who were mostly Tivs at the Abaji town hall on Friday, said the communal crisis between the Egbura and Bassa ethnic groups which led to displacement of other ethnic groups, especially the Tiv was very unfortunate. He said it was only those displaced by the crisis that may know the pains they were going through, and prayed for God to intervene in order to calm the situation. “It is obvious that no matter how we are going to provide shelter to those of you that are displaced, the comfort will not be like when you are at home, but we shall try our best to provide shelter and food pending when the situation is calm,” he said. The chairman noted that the relationship between Abaji and neighbouring Toto Local Government was a  long-standing  one, saying whatever affected Toto affected Abaji because of their proximity. Ajiya told the IDPs that the Ona of Abaji, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, also expressed his sadness over the communal crisis between the Bassa and Egbura ethnic groups, which led to the displacement of people. City News gathered that a communal crisis between the Bassa and Egbura broke out at Ugya community three weeks ago, which led to loss of lives and displacement of some people to Abaji and other villages within the council.
