Kano state governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has donated a parcel of land to Africa TV 3, a private broadcast company, to construct a television station in the state.

Governor Ganduje disclosed this while receiving the Proprietor of the Station, Sheikh Muhammad Fahd At-Tuwaijiri on courtesy visit in Kano, statement signed by the Director General of Media and Communications, Alhaji Aminu K Yassar, said.

“By so doing, we want to ensure that the public are provided with information, and a wide range of perspectives and voices enhanced, so as to entrench sustainable democracy and good governance,” he said.

Gnaduje said the move was also an incentive to facilitate Ease of Doing business in the state, assuring that his administration would provide the station with additional support if required, for efficient take-off of the station.

“I understand that locating the station in Kano has several advantages. It will promote Hausa language and create awareness on the policies and programmes of the State and Federal governments. As a government, we are impressed with the service of Africa TV 3 and we are happy that you have chosen Hausa as one of your languages of broadcast,” he said.

Dr Ganduje maintained that the Kano dialect of Hausa was generally accepted as the standard dialect, stressing that the language speakers across Africa, would undoubtedly appreciate services of the proposed television station.

The proprietor of Africa TV 3, Sheikh Muhammad Fahd At-Tuwaijiri, told the governor that his company, which is based in Saudi Arabia, has vast interests in television broadcasting and would want to establish a station in Kano, which would broadcast its services in Hausa.

Meanwhile, Sheikh At-Tuwaijiri presented an award to the governor, for his sterling contribution towards promoting religious tolerance, peace, human development and propagation of Islam, through the Ganduje Foundation.
