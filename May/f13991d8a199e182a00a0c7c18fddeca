The Commissioner of Police, Kaduna State, Austine Iwar has said that three units of Mobile Police (MOPOL) have been deployed to Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna state following Saturdays attack with a view to further securing the area. The CP said the force is putting in all efforts to ensure the culprits are brought to book. He however urged citizens assist the police by reporting any suspicious person(s) to the nearest police station in order to nip in the bud cases of crime and criminality. In a related development, Birnin Gwari stakeholders have called on Kaduna State government to establish a formidable Community Policing team in Birnin Gwari which will include the police as well as local vigilante called “Yan Sa Kai” in the area. This is contained in a joint press statement signed by Chairman, BEPU, Murtala Abdullahi, Coordinator, Yan Birnin Gwari, Comrade Muhammad Randag, Chairman, Birnin Gwari Empowerment and Development Forum, Junaidu Lawal, and President B/Gwari Students Association (BIGSA), Ibrahim Aliyu Barau.
