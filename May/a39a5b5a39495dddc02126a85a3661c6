Senate President Bukola Saraki has expressed sadness over the death of General Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr. Musa Asake. Saraki, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, described late Asake as a great Christian torchbearer whose work and influence will be of use to many generations. He noted that Asake’s passion, zeal and love for God and the plight of Christians in Nigeria marked him out as a worthy and true servant of God and humanity. He commiserated with the immediate family of the deceased, the leadership of the CAN, the Christian community and the government and people of Kaduna State over the huge loss. “Dr. Asake left no one in doubt where he stood on matters of faith and state during his lifetime,” Saraki said.
