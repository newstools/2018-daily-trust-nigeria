The Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) has sealed off 400 drug stores in Adamawa State over illegal activities. The affected premises comprised of 25 unregistered pharmacies and 365 patent medicine stores out of a total of 527 premises inspected by the council. Mrs. Anthonia Aruya, the PCN Director of Inspection and Monitoring who  spoke at a press conference in Yola said the affected business owners committed offences which include operating without registration, expired licence, poor sanitary conditions and dispensing of ethical products without supervision of pharmacist. “Pharmacists Council of Nigeria cannot guarantee that drugs sold in unregistered outlets are of the same integrity as specified by the manufacturers since they have not submitted to regulation that ensures maintenance of appropriate standards for handling such products”, he stated. She lamented that many pharmacies commenced business without fulfilling the required standards while others do not possess the necessary skills to run such businesses, there by putting members of the public at risk. “Some of these premises stored products in environments where the quality ,safety and efficacy cannot be guaranteed thus exposing the public to serious danger  . Others do not have the requisite knowledge or skills to handle the ethical drugs and control medicines intheir facilities”, she added.. The Director therefore called on the public to buy medicines from licenced pharmacies while urging those intending to start  such businesses to contact the council for guidance.
