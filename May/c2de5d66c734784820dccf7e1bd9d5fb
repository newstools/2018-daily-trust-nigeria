Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong yesterday reminded his predecessor Jonah David Jang that he was also a onetime visitor at the Jos prison and had spent 40 days and nights while also receiving a lot of revelation from God. Lalong stated this yesterday in Jos while addressing over 200 clergymen at the opening ceremony of the 94th General Church Council of Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN) shortly after a speech by Jang was read by his former Commissioner of Information, Pastor Abraham Yiljap. Jang, who represents Plateau North in the Senate, had in a goodwill message to the church said his being remanded in prison was a divine intervention and stated that nobody should boast of sending him to prison. The message read by Yiljap stated that; “For me being in prison is a great lesson in humility. When I was at the EFCC office in Abuja, I slept on the floor, but here in the prison I have the privilege of sleeping in the same bed that former President Olusegun Obasanjo slept in at the Jos prison.” However, while addressing the church, Lalong veered off his speech to reply Jang by saying “before I became the governor of Plateau State, as a Speaker of the State House of Assembly I also spent 40 days in prison. While there, I received a lot of revelations and I was ready to face the allegations against me and at the end of the day, I was cleared.” He said, “Now as a governor, I know that when I vacate office there will be a time for me to account for my stewardship. But when somebody refused to humble himself to accept his imperfection, then the law takes over.” Daily Trust reports that Jang, who was remanded in prison by Justice Daniel Longji over a 12 count charge of alleged corruption and misappropriation of N6.3 billion as governor, is expected in court today for ruling on his bail application.
