Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has defended the present administration’s fight against corruption saying it borders on governance, not ethnic, religious or political leanings. Lalong said this yesterday in his third year anniversary and democracy day speech titled “Integrity, Accountability and Transparency in Leadership.” He said though people have the right to hold their opinions, the fight against corruption was solely the mandate of the anti-graft agencies, which have been statutorily empowered by the relevant Acts of the National Assembly to prosecute corrupt practices. “For the records, by my disposition in life, I do not take any pleasure or gain in witch-hunting anyone as being peddled by those who have chosen, either out of mischief or ignorance, to give an ethnic or political colouration to recent activities of the anti-graft agency in the state,” he said. Lalong said his administration was pursuing special requests made to the presidency for the dualization of the Abuja-Jos road, synergy and intervention for a major Trauma Services and Centre along the Hawan Kibo area as well as support to the Peace Building Initiatives and Roadmap. He said that the state would continue to work with the Federal Government to ensure that all Internally Displaced People (IDPs) were resettled in their original places and their security guaranteed.
