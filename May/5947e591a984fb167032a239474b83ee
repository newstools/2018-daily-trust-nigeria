The pastor of a Celestial church, Jesu Segun parish at Santana bus stop, Ajangbadi, Lagos, Dominic Michael, has been arrested for alleged murder. Michael was alleged to have administered a concoction on a female, Ramat Audu, who died after taking the drink. The suspect yesterday told journalists at the Command Headquarters, Lagos, “I only gave her honey when she was coughing seriously. She was brought to my church by her live-in lover for spiritual healing. After drinking the honey, she left my church but collapsed along the way and died thereafter. I did not kill her as honey is always good for cough patient,” he said. The Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, said the command received a complaint from one Ibrahim Audu of Akesan, Igando, in Lagos, that his sister Ramat, 25, who was living with her boyfriend, Enyinna, was taken to the church by her boyfriend. In the church, Edgal said, Pastor Michael gave the lady a concoction of honey, lime and other things, and that the lady died after drinking the mixture. He said the pastor and Enyinna were likely to be charged to court with murder after investigation.
