The Kaduna State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) says it has uncovered plans by Senator Suleiman Othman Hunkuyi to undermine the party’s congresses in the state. The congresses have been scheduled to start with the ward level on Saturday, May 5. The Acting State Secretary of the party in the state, Alhaji Yahaya Baba Pate, said the party’s membership of Senator Hunkuyi was suspended on February 17 this year for alleged anti-party activities, including creating a faction. He added that many Hunkuyi’s associates had also been expelled for gross violation of the laws of the party. According to Pate, “Senator Hunkuyi has been suspended and therefore cannot directly or indirectly participate in the activities of the APC or convene any gathering in the name of the party, contrary to what he is presently doing. “Furthermore, intelligence at our disposal suggest that he and his expelled associates are planning to destabilize the congresses across the state. There are reports that thugs and mercenaries are being assembled for his purpose. “Consequently, the leadership of the party will hold suspended Senator Hunkuyi responsible for any breakdown of law and order in the course of our congresses,” he said. He said the state APC had alerted security agencies to take measures that would guarantee security and ensure the protection of lives and property of its members and officials who would conduct the congresses in the state. Hunkuyi’s Spokesman, James Obute said the senator’s position on the issue of his purported suspension was very clear. “He is not under suspension; the former acting secretary that organised the press conference where the purported suspension was perfected had been suspended from the party. “His tenure of office expired on April 23 having been sworn in on April 23, 2014. Efforts of Hunkuyi are aimed at deepening and  strengthening democracy,” he said.
