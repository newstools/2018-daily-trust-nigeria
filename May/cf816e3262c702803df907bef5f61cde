A South African student who spent more than $63,000 (£47,500) of $1.1m she received by mistake has appeared in court on a charge of theft. Sibongile Mani, a 28-year-old accountancy student at Walter Sisulu University, was arrested by the police after she was asked to hand herself in, Anelisa Feni, spokeswoman for an elite police unit, the Hawks, told AFP news agency. She qualified last year for $110 a month in food allowances from the government’s National Students Financial Aid Scheme, which helps underprivileged students.
