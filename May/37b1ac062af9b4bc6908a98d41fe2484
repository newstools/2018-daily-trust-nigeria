Amidst incessant attacks on military formations and communities by Boko Haram insurgents in the Northeast, Barr Aisha Alkali Wakil, popularly called Mama Boko Haram, has stressed that the insurgents will soon surrender. Mama Boko Haram, who is a member of the presidential panel on ending insurgency, was speaking in Maiduguri last weekend at the launching of a N500, 000,000 appeal fund by her NGO, the Complete Care and Aid Foundation (COCAAF). Barr Aisha said the seemingly intractable terror and insurgency in the Northeast would soon end and “All my sons (the insurgents) in the bush will insha Allah (by the grace of God) come back home and surrender: they will come back, I am sure.” Mama Boko Haram said: “Even before the Chibok girls’ abduction, we could have succeeded in achieving a peaceful resolution between the insurgents and government if it were not for the saboteurs that aggravated the situation for their selfish and political interests.” She expressed her determination to continue assisting towards the end of the Boko Haram insurgency, stating: “I will not rest until I succeed; I am not relenting; they listen to me; they look at me like a mother.” Barr Aisha Wakil said the humanitarian fund was to redeem the situation of the thousands of widows in distress with their teeming children as a result of the insurgency, as well as the teeming population of the youth submerged in drug abuse to transform their lives to moral uprightness and good citizenship. About N100 million was collected on the spot at the launching of the fund.
