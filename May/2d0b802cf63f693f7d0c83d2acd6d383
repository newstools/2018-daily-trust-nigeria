The Federal Government yesterday said it has declared a state of emergency on Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector. Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu announced this in Abuja at a workshop for state commissioners for water resources on state water utility turnaround and governance reform. He said the decision was made by the Federal Executive Council, while approving a National WASH Action Plan recently. The minister said the declaration seeks to put the full weight of the federal government behind addressing the sectorâ€™s shortcomings and challenges and urged the states to declare their own state of emergency at the state level. He noted that stakeholders needed to think and work differently to close the gap in water supply and sanitation and improve human development outcomes. State commissioners, who spoke at the event, commended the federal government for such declaration, believing that such moves would address water sanitation challenges across the country.
