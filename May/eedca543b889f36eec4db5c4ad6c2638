Two suspected motorcycle thieves identified as Kola and Ibrahim were set ablaze by a mob on Tuesday evening at Peti village in Kwali Area Council. A witness, Aliyu Makama, said the incident happened at about 4:00p.m. when the two suspects boarded a motorcycle at Chukuku village in Kuje to Gwagwalada town. He said they pretended to be bricklayers and were carrying shovel and trowel but that they allegedly stabbed the cyclist on his head while heading to Gwagwalada. He said when the cyclist crashed, the suspects snatched the motorcycle. The cyclist, however summoned courage and raised alarm which attracted the attention of some cyclists at overhead bridge in Gwagwalada, who immediately went after the suspects. Makama said they were apprehended at a cassava farm near Peti village and set ablaze instantly, while their charred corpses were dragged to the road side. “In fact, one of them climbed a tree in the cassava farm, when he saw the mob and they asked him to come down and set him ablaze immediately he descended from the tree, “ he added. Our reporter learnt that the two suspects were residents of Chukuku village, while one of them, Kola by name was a technician at the village and father of four children.
