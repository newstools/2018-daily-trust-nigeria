President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday commiserated with the General Overseer of Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare on the death of his mother, Mrs Abigail Eebudola Bakare. The president expressed his condolences in a telephone call to his friend and one-time running mate. Buhari urged the cleric and the Bakare family to take solace in the fact that the late Mrs Bakare lived long enough to witness the enormous successes achieved by her children. The president called on the bereaved family to uphold the cherished ideals of community service, kindness and generosity associated with the matriarch of the Bakare family, who died on May 5, 2018, aged 108.
