The Lagos State Governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, yesterday attributed his administration’s achievements in the last three years to divine inspiration. Gov Ambode, at a special thanksgiving service at the Lagos House in Alausa, Ikeja, to mark the third anniversary of his administration, believed God had been involved in the process of thinking, planning and executing policies and programmes for the people in the state, considering the “wonderful accomplishments.” The governor said, “No matter how much strategy you have read in school or how much work you have done in the public service, it is not possible for you to put a plan up, strategize and try to implement and it works. If it is working back-to-back and consistently, there has to be some other source that is making it work  because you are just one out of several others. Why it works for Lagos is the more reason why one has to be very sober and humble to actually know that there is something that is making that to happen, and that has to be God.” Justifying the need for the service, the Ambode said it was important to appreciate God’s touch and the people’s support, which he said facilitated his achievements. He assured that more infrastructural projects would be implemented in the next one year. In his exhortation, the Senior Pastor, House on the Rock Church, Paul Adefarasin, commended Gov Ambode for the infrastructural strides and progressive development in Lagos State, saying it was laudable that the state’s economy remained one of the strongest in Africa.
