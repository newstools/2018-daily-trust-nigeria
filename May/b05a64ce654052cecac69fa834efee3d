Parents have been advised against interfering in the choice of career of their children and wards as that will hinder them from developing passion for the profession. Some of the parents, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Mararaba and New Nyanya, Nasarawa State, on Monday, said such interference could have negative impact on career choice by children. Some of them argued that the reason most children were not doing well in their careers was because most parents had failed to allow them choose what they have passion for. A career counsellor, Mrs Bridget Afegu, said the guiltiest group in the society was the educated class. “They always interfere in the choice of their children’s careers. “Their choice is usually for their son or daughter to be a medical doctor or an engineer,” she said. According to her, the rich people always want to ensure that their children were able to take over their business empire by all means. She advised parents to desist from interfering in their children’s choice of career, saying that such has negative impact on many children and wards. (NAN)
