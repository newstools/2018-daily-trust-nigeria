The Public Complaint Commission (PCC) in Kogi State on Monday said it has resolved 428 cases received from various individuals in the state as at April 2018. The Director of Investigation at the Commission, Mr Tom B. Acheneje, who disclosed this in Lokoja while handing over to its new commissioner, Mr Otitoju Gabriel Olusuyi, added that a total of 235 cases were still pending. 

According to him, a total of 631 cases were handled in 2017 out of which 388 were successfully resolved while 247 were pending. 

He said most of the cases received were petitions by civil servants over wrongful termination of appointments, unpaid salaries/entitlements and non payment of compensations for landed property amongst others. 

Acheneje identified inadequate office accommodation, poor funding, recalcitrant posture of some respondents and lack of coercive powers to enforce decisions as some of the challenges hampering the smooth of operations of the Commission in the state. 

The new PCC commissioner, Mr Olusuyi assured that the Commission under his watch would ensure justice is served to people of the state.

He promised to take a tour of the local government areas in the state to sensitise and also get complaints from members of the public with a view to resolving them. 

Mr Olusuyi urged staff of the commission to join hands with him in actualising the vision of the organization.
