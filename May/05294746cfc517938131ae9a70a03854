Four vehicles were damaged in an accident that left two people injured on Gwarinpa bypass on Tuesday. Witnesses said the accident, which happened at about 2pm on the road connecting Life Camp to Kubwa Expressway, involved a Toyota Sienna SUV, Toyota Corolla salon car and two articulated trucks were involved in the accident. A florist who witnessed the accident but pleaded anonymity said the SUV driver coming from Life Camp roundabout was trying to negotiate a turn to the left before it was hit by a truck from the rear. “The Sienna then rammed into an oncoming articulated truck knocking out the truck’s battery and some parts thereby making the truck’s driver lose control and almost crash into a canal about few metres away,” he said. He said a Toyota Corolla vehicle coming behind the articulated truck rammed into the Sienna while the other truck driver ran into a ditch, adding that two people were injured including the driver of the truck that crashed into a ditch. The accident led to a traffic gridlock until the arrival of traffic wardens who towed the vehicles from the road.
