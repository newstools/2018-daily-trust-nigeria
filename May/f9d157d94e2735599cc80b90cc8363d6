The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) says it has granted a ‘No Objection’ to 22 firms to procure and install meters for customers under the 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos). A statement by the General Manager,  Public Affairs, Usman Abba-Arabi, said the ‘No Objection’ qualifies intending investors to participate in the meter procurement process in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). The MAP Regulation that enabled new investors to finance mass metering plans for electricity users was brought into effect by NERC on April 3, 2018. It mandates the DisCos to engage meter assets providers who fund purchase, installation and replacement of meters to meet DisCos’ metering obligations to their customers. “This is to ensure that all electricity customers are metered thereby reducing incidences of estimated electricity billing to the barest minimum,” NERC said in the statement available on its social media platforms. The commission said the approval was given after it had conducted due diligence on the supporting documents to the applications submitted by interested investors as prescribed by the regulation. NERC however said more applicants can do so as the exercise is continuous. Among the approved firms are Huawei Technology Company Nigeria Ltd,  Bilview Energy Ltd, Chintech Electro Nigeria Ltd, Holley Metering Ltd, MEMCOL, and Meron Nigeria Ltd. Others include Integrated Power, MBH Power, Trimani Engineering,  Sapropel Energy Resources, Megawatt Distribution International, and Unistar Hi-Tech Systems. Still in the list are Imperial Infrastructure Development Company, Ratio Consulting, Protogy Global Services, Paktim Metering,  Sabrud Consortium, Tinuten, Kayz Consortium, BTS Power, CIG Metering Assets, and Cresthill Energy.
