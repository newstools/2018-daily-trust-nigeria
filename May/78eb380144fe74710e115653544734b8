President Muhammadu Buhari returned to Abuja last night two days after he left Washington DC where he met President Donald Trump. The president arrived at about 10:30pm, according to his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina. President Buhari had left Washington DC on Tuesday. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, earlier yesterday said Buhari had a technical stopover in London. “They had a technical stopover in London. I am sure if you keep your ears to the ground, you will hear of his arrival soon,” Shehu said. “The big jet is under repair. It has been taken for major repairs. So, the President is using a small plane and there is a limit to the distance the small plane can cover. “This is very normal. There is nothing unusual about it. In any case, they are already on their way back home,” Shehu said. Also, Adesina, via his Twitter handle, had assured  that Buhari would arrive in Abuja yesterday evening. Daily Trust reports that Buhari was scheduled to spend this weekend in his country home of Daura, Katsina State. The president’s advance team, comprising security operatives, protocol staff and journalists, left Abuja for Katsina State on Thursday.
