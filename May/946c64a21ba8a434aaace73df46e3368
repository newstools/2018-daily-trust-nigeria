The Sokoto State Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, Professor Aishat Madawaki, has said poor reading culture is a very serious issue with students because students now hardly read their book but spend their time on Facebook. She said at a readership promotion campaign organized in Sokoto by the National Library that the trend was worrisome but that the state government was working hard to reverse it. She said the government would stock all libraries with e-books and employ skilled people to manage the enabling equipment. The Chairman of the Board of the Federal College of Education, Idah in Kogi State, Dr. Ibrahim Liman, who dwelt on the reading culture issue, said reading skill was the main hindrance to success of the Sokoto State students in the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE). Delivering a paper on ‘Building and Sustaining Reading Culture among Nigerian Future Leaders for Positive Development,’ Ibrahim Liman said the reading culture among Nigerians was alarmingly poor. He said a research indicated that many students failed exams because of poor reading culture, and suggested that stakeholders should motivate students to read while school proprietors should provide standard libraries. In his opening remark, the National Librarian, Professor Lenrie Aina who was represented by a deputy director, Mrs Rose Nature, said the objective of the campaign was to encourage reading among Nigerians.
