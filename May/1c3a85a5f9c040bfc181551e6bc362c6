The Lagos Division of the Appeal Court yesterday nullified a ruling by the Federal High Court (FHC) which prohibited the arrest of Senator Buruji Kashamu who represents Ogun East Senatorial District, by Nigerian law enforcement agencies. The three man-panel was delivering judgment in an appeal filed by the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) against the ruling of the Federal High Court Lagos and Federal High Court Abuja restraining the NDLEA and other security agencies from arresting and extraditing the senator. The panel led by Justice Yagarta Nimper upheld the federal governmentâ€™s appeal by setting aside the earlier judgments of the Federal High Court, Lagos delivered by Justice Okon Abang. The court also set aside the ruling of the lower court nullifying the extradition warrant issued against Senator Kashamu. Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court had on May 25, 2015, restrained the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and other Agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria, perpetually from arresting, detaining, attacking or otherwise effecting the abduction of Senator Kashamu upon charges based on allegations of drug trafficking leveled against him by the United States government.
