The Director General, National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Dame Julie Okah-Donli said  the Agency is preparing to rescuing thousands of stranded Nigerian youth mostly girls from some neighbouring West African countries. The DG said NAPTIP has commenced series of interface with key stakeholders and other partners in this regard and that its operatives will soon proceed to those countries to identify and profile the victims ahead of the evacuation. Reports say thousands of victims of human trafficking and irregular migration are stranded in the neighbouring West Africa countries of Mali, Togo, Ghana and others on their way to Europe. she said, “It is no secret that the high percentage of victims of human trafficking are young girls, who are often lured or enticed with the promises of better lives in the cities or outside the country. “These young girls get to their purported dream destination only to end up in forced exploitative prostitution, whereby the proceeds they make from selling their bodies in exchange for monetary gains are forcefully taken away by their pimps and madams,” Okah-Donli explained. She noted that it was the worst human rights abuse and degradation adding that, “one girl could be sold over and over again by different pimps until she is of no productive use to anyone."
