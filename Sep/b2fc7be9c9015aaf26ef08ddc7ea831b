Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has said the call for Nigeria’s restructuring is not about re-shuffling a few responsibilities or resources, but disrupting the authoritarian politics democracy inherited from the military and colonial rulers. Atiku was reacting to a recent interaction in the United States where Vice President Yemi Osinbajo asserted that the “problem with our country is not a matter of restructuring…and we must not allow ourselves to be drawn into the argument that our problems stem from  some geographic re-structuring.” In a statement yesterday from Atiku’s media office emailed to Daily Trust on Sunday, the former Vice President noted that it was a surprise that the Vice President would take such a position and, in particular, “fail to appreciate the connection between Nigeria’s defective structure and its underperformance”. According to the statement, re-structuring is not about the re-drawing of state or regional boundaries, but a Nigeria that not only provides opportunities for everyone to work but even more specifically  challenges every layer of governance to demonstrate capacity to create wealth and jobs for the citizens. Also, it stated that restructuring is not just about the devolution of powers to the states, but about transforming the respective roles of the federal, state and local governments to perform more efficiently in matters of territorial as well as economic governance.
