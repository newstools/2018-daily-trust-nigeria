The Coalition of 39 United Political Parties (CUPP) has alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are secretly working to derail the conduct of the 2019 general elections. CUPP, in a statement yesterday by its spokesman, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, claimed that part of the “plot” was to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari did not sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law. The coalition also claimed that stopping of the Continuous Voter Registration by INEC yesterday was another way of trying to disenfranchise some aggrieved Nigerians who were willing to vote out the incumbent government. “The APC is scared of the amendment and currently pressuring Buhari to withhold assent and travel to China despite knowing the importance of signing the amendment as most of INEC 2019 preparation and budget are tied to some provisions in the yet to be signed law. “The new amendments especially the mandatory use of card readers, electronic transmission of results and accreditation will give no room for massive rigging and manipulation of figures in 2019. “This will in turn grant them some more undue advantage in the 2019 general election for which the President is obviously having a mortal fear that Nigerians will throw him out of office,” CUPP said.
