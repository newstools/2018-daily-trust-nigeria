Nine persons are confirmed to have died of gastroenteritis following an outbreak of the disease in seven local government areas of Sokoto State. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Pharmacist Al Mustapha Othman Ali, said yesterday in Sokoto that most of the affected local government areas -- Ilela, Gada, Sabon Birni, Goronyo, Isa, Tureta and Rabah -- border Niger Republic where cases of the disease were earlier reported. He attributed the outbreak to the overflow of rainwater into sources of drinking water. The worst-hit is Tureta LGA where we had 80 cases and about five deaths, he said. In Rabah, he said three deaths were recorded at Gandi, two at the Primary Healthcare Centre and one at the IDP camp. He said a team of medical experts was dispatched to all the affected areas to bring the situation under control. ‘’We want people to understand that there are deaths due to outbreak and natural causes, on daily basis we have deaths from other causes but from official records on the outbreak, we have 9 deaths,” he said. He urged people of the areas to avoid rumours on the outbreak while stressing the need for them to improve personal and environmental hygiene.
