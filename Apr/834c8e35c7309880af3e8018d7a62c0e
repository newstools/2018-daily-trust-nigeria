The Sokoto Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service has said the 48 exotic vehicles discovered in Sokoto State would be forfeited to the Federal Government if the owner does not show up within 30 days. Briefing journalists in Sokoto yesterday, the Area Comptroller, Alhaji Nasir Ahmed urged the public to disregard the rumour that the vehicles seized were 160. He said the vehicles were 48 and they could not be said to belong to any prominent politician as reported because nobody had claimed their ownership yet. He also clarified that the vehicles were not seized in a house but from a fenced plot of land. Ahmed said the command had generated N443.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 as against the N368.8 million generated same time last year. He added that over 2000 bags of foreign rice and 527 jerry cans of vegetable oil were seized by the command with a duty paid value of N41.2 million and N6.6 million respectively.
