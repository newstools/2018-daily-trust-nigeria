Lagos State intending Pilgrims have been urged to complete their payment on or before April 30th to enable them participate in this year’s hajj exercise. The Commissioner for Home Affairs and Lagos State Amir-ul- Hajj, Dr. AbdulHakeem Abdullateef made the call during the stakeholders’ meeting held at the Old Secretariat Central mosque, Ikeja. This is against the backdrop of the low turnout of intending pilgrims which has been the trend nationwide. The commissioner, who was represented by the chairman, Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, Dr. Tajudeen Yusuf however appealed to all intending pilgrims to ensure all payments were made by April ending if they must participate in the 2018 Hajj exercise. He explained that the deadline was not given by Lagos but the decision of Saudi Arabia and National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) as the regulator of hajj affairs in Nigeria. AbdulLateef advised the intending pilgrims to take the deadline seriously, adding that whoever and for any reason did not complete the payment will not have the opportunity of performing the 2018 Hajj. The Amir-ul-hajj also stressed the imperative of peaceful co-existence among the various religious groups in the state and assured them that the Akinwunmi Ambode-led government is determined to take the state to the next level through the provision of basic infrastructural facilities. Meanwhile, a statement by the spokesperson of the state pilgrims’ welfare board said the weekend’s enlightenment which began on April 21st would continue in all the 18 designated local government centres including Agege, Ajeromi Ifelodun, Alimosho, Amuwo Odofin, Apapa, Badagry/Ojo, Epe, Eti Osa and Ikeja.
