Healthcare practitioners have called on the Federal Government to prioritize funding of routine immunization under the primary healthcare under one roof policy (PHCUOR). A statement yesterday from PACFaH@Scale said the President of the National Association of Community Health Practitioners of Nigeria (NACHPN) Mr Akor Ekechukwu Jude made the call during the associationâ€™s 24th annual scientific in Katsina. Mr Akor said the biggest health challenge in the country lies in the remote and rural areas, where members of the community health practitioners overlook service delivery to the people. He said it was due to the significance of the position of NACHPN that they decided to partner PACFaH@Scale to improve healthcare service delivery to Nigerians. He condemned the decision of the Federal Government in engaging community health influencers and promoters despite having thousands of trained community health practitioners that are unemployed across the country. Dr Emmanuel Abanida, Senior Technical Advisor to PACFaH@Scale, said the conference was aimed at galvanizing discussions on why government should prioritize health funding especially routine immunization under the PHCUOR policy.
