Sixty-two casual staff of the Katsina State Hotels and Tourism Board have been presented with permanent and pensionable appointments by the Katsina State Government. Some of the staff had been on casual status for over 19 years before this present conversion as promised them by Governor Aminu Masari three years ago. Presenting them with their letters, the state Commissioner of Commerce, Alhaji Abubakar Yusuf, said the move was aimed at improving services at the board. He said human empowerment was an integral part of the state governmentâ€™s Restoration Agenda, which had been pursued through the creation of thousands of employment opportunities in the education, health and tourism sectors. In his speech, the General Manager of the State Hotels and Tourism Board, Alhaji Abubakar Badaru Jikamshi, reiterated that some of the staff had served as casual workers for the last 19 years, as the board had not made new appointments for the past 22 years. Jikamshi said the staff were deployed to the state-owned motels in Katsina, Daura, Funtua, Malumfashi and Dutsinma.
