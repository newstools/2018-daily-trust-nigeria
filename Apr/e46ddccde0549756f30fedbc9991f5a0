The Presidency has raised the alarm that as 2019 general elections draw near, politicians are becoming desperate to achieve ill-motivated desires. It said the country, at this time, was in need of spiritual support of respectable clergy. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, said this at the Presidential Villa in Abuja on Friday while receiving pastors of the Gospel Faith Mission International led by the Deputy General Overseer of the Mission, Pastor Emmanuel Oluwayemi. He urged religious leaders to continue to pray for the unity, peace and prosperity of the nation, especially for the 2019 elections. “As we approach the election year, please continue to pray that all will be well with our country. People are getting desperate to ensure that their desires, often ill-motivated, are actualised. "But by the prayers of spiritual fathers like you, it will be well with the country,” the presidential spokesman said. According to Adesina, God is the ultimate solution to all challenges and that no man has the solution to happenings around him. He expressed delight that the Gospel Faith Mission International had chosen to offer spiritual support to Federal Government. Adesina reiterated President Muhammadu Buhari's statement that he is not a religious bigot and can never be one. Earlier, Oluwayemi had said the church and the nation had a lot to do together, especially now that tension was high in the country. He noted that role of the church is to advise and pray for leaders of the country as commanded by God in the scriptures. He acknowledged their (religious leaders') role as co-builders in Nigeria to ensure fairness and justice. The cleric assured that the Gospel Faith Mission International would continue to support the government rather than heat up the polity.
