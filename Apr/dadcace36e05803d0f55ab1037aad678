An award-winning Kannywood director, Kamal Sani Alkali has urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government to formulate policies and strictures that would make Hausa film industry known as Kannywood to wax strongly. The director of the movie 'Laila Adnan', 'Sahabi' and 'Umar Sanda' made the call in an interview with Daily Trust,  explaining that lack of sufficient funds for Kannywood filmmakers, insufficient cinemas in the North and piracy had impeded the development and progress of Kannywood into becoming the best hub for business. He said "We want Buhari's government to construct standard cinemas in the North or give out loans with zero interest rate to filmmakers to build cinemas, by doing that Kannywood would be safe haven for filmmakers in the future." The Best Director 2017 City People Award has also called on federal government to establish a perfect way of fighting piracy that has been bedevilling Kannywood for more than two decades. "Kannywood is in a dire state and on the verge of collapse, and this is as a result of piracy. The Nigerian Copy Right Commission has done almost nothing to salvage the situation despite paying the sum of N15, 000 per each film to the federal government," he said. Alkali who is also a script writer and the Managing Director of Kamal Films International Ltd. also advised federal government to support filmmakers with soft loans to enable them produce world standard films.
