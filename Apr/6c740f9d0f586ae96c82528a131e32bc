Five communities, spread across the Abeokuta North/ Odeda/Obafemi-Owode Federal Constituency in Ogun State, at the weekend became beneficiaries of brand new transformers, ending months of electricity blackout in their respective areas. The communities are Ajangbohun in Odeda Local Government Area, Mowe in Ofada/Mokoloki LCDA, Ajebo in Obafe LCDA, Iyana Idiori/Ilese Awo in Okeogun LCDA and Ajangbohun Community in Odeda Local Government Area of the state. The benefactor, who is also the member representing the constituency in the National Assembly, Mikky Kazzim, said the gesture was in response to the request the communities made late last year. Kazzim, who spoke through his Special Assistant, Mr Sunday Afolabi said, “Different reports were made over damaged and condemned transformers in these communities, which have subjected our people to months of darkness. “Our representative, Hon Kazzim, personally visited these areas independently to ascertain the situation and expressed concern over the situation. “Our distinguished representative realized that apart from the personal deprivation the blackout was causing, the social and economic factors too cannot be overemphasized, hence his resolve to ensure that relief must come before the end of the second quarter of this year. He immediately placed orders for the transformers. Five of them were supplied during the week, and he directed that we should take them to the communities at no cost.” Afolabi delivered Kazzim’s message to the communities to protect the transformers from vandalism  and damage, assuring he would continue to be responsive to the yearnings of his constituents
