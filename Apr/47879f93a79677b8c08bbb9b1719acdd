The Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, has attributed his successes to Senator David Mark. Ekweremadu stated this at the weekend during the 70th birthday celebration of the former Senate President in Otukpo. He posited that Mark’s era as head of the red chamber left an indelible mark on Nigeria’s democracy. “I attribute all my successes to God and David Mark. David taught me two things that l can’t forget; how to play golf and pilot helicopter, but l failed all because he gave me too much jobs to do,” he said. Ekweremadu further explained that he did well in the things learnt from Mark except golfing that he never had the time to learn properly and piloting a helicopter which he attempted but landed in a cassava plantation. He lauded Mark for helping him through all his tribulations and successes in his political journey, maintaining that his rare qualities brought political stability to the National Assembly; especially constitutional amendment, electoral reforms and the doctrine of necessity. “Mark became a better solution to Nigeria’s problem between 2007 and 2011. I urge him to continue in his belief and trust in God,” Ekweremadu added.
