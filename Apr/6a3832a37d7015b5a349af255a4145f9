 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Independent National  Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately proscribe the All Progressives Congress (APC) following what it termed the undisputed revelations that the ruling party financed President Muhammadu Buhari’s 2015 campaign with "looted funds." The opposition party in a statement on Monday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan also gave the Buhari-led Presidency a three-day ultimatum to respond to allegations that it was elected through looted 
funds or find itself top on the list of confirmed looters. The PDP said instead of the Presidency and the APC to come out with a response on how President Buhari’s 2015 campaign was funded they were busy publishing names of PDP chieftains who have neither been found guilty of corruption nor convicted. "It is evidently clear that the APC-led federal government and the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, are running away from the issue of how they raised money to install Buhari as President. "They have pressed the panic button and resorted to unfounded allegations  against PDP members just to divert the attention of Nigerians and the international community from their atrocious government and its manifold failures of leadership. "Now that the APC, the federal government, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and the  Buhari Presidency have chosen a loud silence rather than accepting that looted funds were used to install Buhari as President in 2015, we charge 
INEC to do the needful by commencing the process for the proscription of the APC as a political party. "The PDP will not join the panicky APC and the federal government in their resort to engage in matters that are subjudice because we believe and respect the rule of law, particularly, as it concerns the rights of every citizen. "We know those in the APC and Buhari’s cabinet, who as champions of looting, plundered the resources of their various states and handed same over for the very expensive electioneering campaign of President Buhari, 
who had earlier confessed of his insolvency. "We have challenged the APC and the Presidency to declare the sources of these funds and how they were used since they have been proven to come from public coffers," the PDP said.
