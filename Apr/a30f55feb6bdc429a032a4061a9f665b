Jacob Zuma, South Africaâ€™s former president, will appear at the Durban High Court on Friday to face more than a dozen corruption charges that date back to a fraught $2.5bn arms deal in the mid 1990s. At least 2,000 supporters of the former president are also expected to turn up to the proceedings and protest against the charges levelled at him. Those defending Zuma argue that the courts are compromised and biased against him. Zuma, 75, faces 16 charges of corruption, racketeering and fraud, including taking bribes from a French arms manufacturer in a set of accusations that have long dogged his political career. The French manufacturer will also be charged with corruption. Company representatives are expected to appear in court alongside Zuma.
