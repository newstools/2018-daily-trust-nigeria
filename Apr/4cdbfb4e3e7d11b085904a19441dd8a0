The Kogi State Government has refuted speculation that Governor Yahaya Bello is incapacitated after sustaining an injury last weekend. There was rumour over the weekend that the governor was badly injured and hospitalised after he fell off his official vehicle around the Lokoja Old Market while trying to acknowledge cheers and dole out money to people in the area. But a press statement signed by the Director General, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Mr. Kingsley Fanwo, said the governor only sustained minor injury in his left leg when he missed his step while alighting from a vehicle on Friday, March 30. Fanwo said the governor was neither incapacitated nor hospitalized, explaining, “He was treated by his doctors who bandaged the leg and discharged him. We thank all the governor’s supporters and well-wishers who inquired after his wellbeing.”
