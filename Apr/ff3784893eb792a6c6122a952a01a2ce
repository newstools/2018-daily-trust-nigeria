Former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, has described the demise of the party’s former National Vice-Chairman, Chief Ishola Filani, as a colossal loss.  Chief Filani, 72, who was the party’s South-West PDP chairman between 2012 and 2014, died on Thursday in London, United Kingdom.    George described his death as very painful, adding that Filani will be sorely missed wherever commitment, honor, candor, pursuit of excellence are basic ingredients of polished attainments.    In a statement, he said, “He was a man of warmth, full of devotion, enveloped within whatever cause he pursued with vigor and sheer honesty. He resonated with settled intelligence and far reaching determined articulation. He could be combative in debate but without malice.    “He could disagree with demonstrated fervor but without acrimony. He was a patriot with passion, a distinguished lawyer with assertive merits”.    Similarly, the South-West Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, said the party received the news of the death with rude shock while consoling with his family.    “While alive, he was a democrat and gave his all. He is a committed, resourceful and loyal leader of the party”, he said.
