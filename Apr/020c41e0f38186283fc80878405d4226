A house wife, Asma’u Sulaiman, on Thursday  prayed a Sharia court at  Magajin Gari Kaduna to dissolve her marriage with her husband over  frequent demand for anal sex. Suleiman also told the court that her husband, Nura Ahmad, has been assaulting and accusing her of infidelity. “There was a time I went to my parents house over a misunderstanding I  had with my husband, when I returned, he accused me of aborting my  pregnancy which was not true”, she told the court. The complainant said she came to court to get justice as she could no  longer endure the pain and was scared of contracting disease from anal  sex. However, Ahmad denied the allegations made against him, saying they were untrue. The Judge Malam Musa Sa’ad asked the wife if she had any witness that  would testify for her and she answered in affirmative except for the  intimacy scene. The judge then adjourned the case to April 18 for the complainant to present her witnesses. (NAN)
