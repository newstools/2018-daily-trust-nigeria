In recognition of its outstanding role in empowering rural women and the less privileged, Ecobank Nigeria Plc. has donated assorted food items to Helpline Foundation for the Needy (HFN), Abuja. The bank said the donation was part of effort to partner with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and to further strengthen its corporate social responsibility. Presenting rice, milk, noodles, garri, among others to the president of Helpline, Ecobank’s Human Resource Manager, Mrs. Jemimah Pelem, stressed that the foundation had done well in the area of empowerment of rural women; especially widows across the six area councils of the territory. Mrs. Pelem commended the initiative of the president of the Foundation, Dr. Jummai Ahmadu, for what she described as “unparalleled gesture” in reaching out to the less privileged, just as she assured the foundation of future partnership. “Today’s event is part of our social corporate responsibility to reach out to the needy in the society and to commemorate this year’s International Women’s Day (IWD) celebration, and to carry out such objective, the bank identified genuine NGOs who have been in the forefront of assisting rural women and widows. “The bank has followed the activities of Helpline Foundation for the past three years, and we decided to support and partner with the foundation because we at Ecobank believe that together we can do it,” she said. Dr. Jummai Ahmadu thanked the financial institution for the donation, just as she assured the bank that the items would be judiciously distributed to the widows, while soliciting for a more robust partnership.
