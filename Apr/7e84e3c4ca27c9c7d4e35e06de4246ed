The administration of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje is constructing an underpass and flyover at Dangi roundabout in Kano city as part of its effort to end chaotic traffic in the city. The state commissioner for information, youth and culture, Malam Muhammad Garba disclosed this in a statement in Abuja yesterday. He dismissed as ‘stark ignorance’ of the inner workings of government, attempt by some individuals to discredit the Dangi roundabout underpass and flyover construction project through ‘unsubstantiated’ allegations. He said the project, which foundation laying was performed by Ganduje at a ground breaking ceremony, was approved at the 111th state Executive Council Meeting, and is aimed at ensuring the provision of good road networks that will curtail chaotic traffic situation in the city. The commissioner, however, said some “disgruntled elements, who are serving the interest of a political cult in the state, are hell bent on creating confusion by accusing the government of executing the gigantic project outside budgetary allocation.”
