A new towing and lifting capacity equipment, Super Metro Elephant has been procured by the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA which brings the number of light and heavy duty equipment procured by the Agency to 50 in the last three years. The new Super Metro Elephant with multiple features can serve the purpose of Crane and Goliath combined especially when the situation to be attended to falls within the capacity of the Super Metro. The General Manager of LASEMA, Mr. Tiamiyu Adeshina, who unveiled the new equipment on Friday at the Agency's office at Cappa, Oshodi in Lagos, said that the Super Metro can move at a higher pace than the regular crane and Goliath, and will also not encounter the difficulty of moving around the State especially some areas that cannot accommodate the crane and the Goliath because of their huge sizes. Speaking further on the features of the vehicle, the General Manager added that the Super Metro Elephant can work from the rear, the left side and the right and can pick objects from the three positions especially fallen tankers and articulated vehicles. "The Super Metro doesn't work from the back alone, it works and auxillates to 270 degrees and has a retracted boom capacity of 9 tonnes that can tow and drag out any trapped vehicle or articulated truck to a safer place," he stated. According to him, the State Government has arragement in place for regular maintenance and replacement of parts for all its vehicles and other equipment, stressing that the good mainatenance culture has kept the fleets of vehicles within the disposal of the agency working since the last two years without any major breakdown. Tiamiyu also disclosed that plans are in place to procure more emergency response equipment to serve some LASEMA Centres that are presently under construction in different parts of the state.
