Eight out of 11 chairmanship aspirants under the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Doma Local Government Area of Nasarawa State have rejected the idea of a consensus candidate, insisting that the party primaries scheduled for tomorrow must hold. The aspirants made their position known at a stakeholders meeting led by the electoral committee of the party yesterday in Doma. The aspirants rejected the idea of endorsing the current Interim Management Committee Chairman of Doma, Mallam Rabo Sani, as a consensus candidate for the May 26 local government election. One of the aspirants, Ahmadu Danjuma Ogah, expressed displeasure over the way the party handles its affairs in some localities, saying imposition of candidate is one of the factors that destroys political parties in Nigeria. Ogah tasked the electoral committee to provide a level playing ground for aspirants of various positions to enable the electorate choose people they want. Another aspirant, Alhaji Rilwanu Idris Amama, called on the stakeholders to intervene in the interest of peace, equity and progress of the party. Former Interim Management Committee Chairman of Doma and also an aspirant, John Danlami Ogah, urged the committee to allow democracy prevail, adding that imposition of candidate is not only undemocratic, but that it deprives the electorate the right to choose their leaders.
