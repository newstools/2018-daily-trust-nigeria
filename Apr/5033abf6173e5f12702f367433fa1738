A mother of two, Adijat Fijabi, has dragged her husband, Akeem Yekini Fijabi, before the Ile Tuntun customary court, Mapo, Ibadan, over his alleged failure to pay for her hospital bill after a childbirth. In her suit, Adijat told the court that when she gave birth to her second child, her husband neglected her in the hospital by not showing up, claiming he did not have money to pay the medical bill. She said it was her grandmother who eventually rescued her when the hospital managers were disgracing her in the hospital. Adijat said, “My lord, my husband is a wicked man. He hasn’t cared for me and the children since we got married three years ago. When I wanted to give birth to our second child two years ago, he didn’t show up. When it was time to discharge me, he said he didn’t have money to pay, hence he wouldn’t come.” Agunbiade urged the two families to wade in and resolve the disagreement amicably. He adjourned the case to May 15, 2018 for further hearing.
