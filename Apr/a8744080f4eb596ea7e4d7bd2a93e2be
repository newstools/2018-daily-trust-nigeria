The Senator representing Plateau South Senatorial District, Jeremiah Useni, yesterday, formally expressed his intention to contest for the governorship seat of Plateau State under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Useni and a number of his supporters were at the PDP secretariat at Yakubu Gowon way in Jos where he personally presented his letter of intent to the state party executives. While presenting the letter, the retired army general said his decision followed wide consultation with the people of the state, saying he would soon make a formal declaration. “I am not a stranger in Plateau; I am not a stranger in politics. Plateau State used to be a peaceful state, but today it is unfortunate. Though I am not here to blame anyone,” he said. He admonished his campaign team to avoid campaign of calumny, but stressed that they must give their best to ensure victory. Responding, the state PDP Chairman, Damishi Sango, described Useni as a great leader. “There is no APC in Plateau State, it is a PDP state, but we know that there was an accident, and having healed the injuries, we will come back to get back our state,” he said. Sango assured that the PDP would provide the enabling playing ground for all members.
