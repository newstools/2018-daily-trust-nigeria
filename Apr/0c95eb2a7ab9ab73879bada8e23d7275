Niger State Command of Nigeria Immigration Service yesterday intercepted 67 Irregular Migrants from Niger Republic in two locations in the State, Mrs Amadih Animim Hornby, the State Comptroller, has disclosed. NIS had late last year deployed armed personnel to tighten security across the border areas in the state to check the influx of migrants. The Comptroller told newsmen yesterday that the measure was yielding results with the interception of the migrants at Ungwar Daji around Chanchaga local government area and Kagara, in Raffi Council. She said among those intercepted were 7 minors, 7 women, while the remaining were adult males. She said the gesture was the second in the series, while promising that officers and men of the command would continue with the clampdown and ensuring tight security around the borders to check the influx. The Comptroller explained that those intercepted have no valid travelling document and permit to legally reside in the country, even as she said some of them were idle and constitute security threat to the country. She said the migrants would be repatriated through Katsina State back to their country of origin. She explained that officers at the border post had been adequately briefed on the new strategies to be adopted in preventing influx of illegal migrants. “We have equipped and stationed well armed personnel in strategic areas to prevent illegal migrants coming into our midst,” she said.
