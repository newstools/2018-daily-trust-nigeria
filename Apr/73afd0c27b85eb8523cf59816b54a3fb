Chemical weapons inspectors have entered the Syrian town of Douma to probe an alleged poison gas attack, according to the state-run SANA news agency. The delegation from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) entered the town near the capital, Damascus, along with the Syrian health minister on Tuesday, a source close to the government told Germany’s DPA news agency. “What we understand is that they are going to inspect and investigate the site of that alleged chemical weapons attack,” said Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon. “They are going to take samples and talk to witnesses, doctors and people who were there,” she added.
