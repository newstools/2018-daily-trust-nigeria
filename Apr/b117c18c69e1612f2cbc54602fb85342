Nigeria has about 22 million cattle worth over N3.4 trillion, which is equivalent to 10 oil wells, the Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Nomadic Education, Professor Bashir Usman said. He stated this on Monday at a two-day conference on “The Dynamic of Pastoral Nomadism in Contemporary Nigeria,” organised by the Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. Professor Usman added that the figure made up about 50 percent of the country’s total national budget. The executive secretary added that cattle business in Nigeria was a huge source of revenue and can supplement revenues from oil and contribute towards the economic diversification drive of the Federal Government. Usman described the conference as timely, saying different speakers at the conference would brainstorm during the two-day event, with a view to proffer solutions for the government to implement in addressing the lingering farmers/herdsmen clashes. “It is our hope that at the end of the conference, practical solutions would be proffered for implementation by both the federal, states and local governments respectively,” he said. Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Alhassan Mohammed Gani, said the conference was the first national conference organized by the university, as part of its contribution towards providing a solution to the lingering farmers/herdsmen crises. He said the conference theme was chosen deliberately to address a burning national issue that has defied solution over the years. Gani added that the lingering farmers/herdsmen crisis requires scientific and holistic approach, in order to find lasting solutions. Professor Gani said the expectation after the conference is, “to explore opportunities and support initiatives that will solve the continued herdsmen/farmers clashes in some parts of the country.”
