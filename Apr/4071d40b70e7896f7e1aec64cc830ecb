The senator representing Sokoto North Senatorial District, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, has described the recent allegation that he and Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso misappropriated N18 billion  while they were governors as maliciously fictitious. Wamakko was Sokoto State governor between 2007 and 2015 while Kwankwaso was Kano State governor first from 1999 to 2003 and then from 2011 to 2015. Speaking to journalists in Sokoto regarding the allegation, Wamakko said, “I have never had N1billion in my life. I am not a rich man. I don’t keep money.’’ He said the petition was not from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) but from some merchants of falsehood. “It was part of the ceaseless but abortive evil machinations of a failed politician who thinks that Wamakko should never breathe and live. The frail, failed, ungodly politician and his unpatriotic mercenaries want to bring Wamakko down. It is the Almighty Allah that made Wamakko what he is now and He is the only one who can bring him down,’’ he charged, asserting, “I have never stolen any money.” He said he had served the Sokoto State meritoriously, honestly, diligently and transparently. He challenged the authors of the allegations to publish the details of such financial transactions in the newspapers, to corroborate their claims. The EFCC, he said,  “is a reputable agency that has officials with respect and decorum, who will never use uncourteous and unethical language like the one used in the publication.” On his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari, Wamakko said, “We meet regularly to discuss vital national issues and there has never been a time when my request to see him was turned down.”
