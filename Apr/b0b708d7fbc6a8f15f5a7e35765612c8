The Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig-Gen. Suleiman Kazaure yesterday lamented the dilapidated condition of facilities in orientation camps of the scheme across the country.  The NYSC boss who spoke at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Batch ‘A’ Pre-orientation Workshop, held in Ibadan, on Wednesday, said that the facilities in many of the orientation camps were nothing to write home about.  He said that the law establishing the NYSC scheme placed the responsibility of provision and maintenance of orientation camps on state governments.  The NYSC boss therefore reiterated his call on stakeholders to live up to their statutory responsibility through provision of necessary facilities at orientation camps so as to make the scheme more effective.  Kazaure said, “Permit me to use this occasion to remind all stakeholders that the law establishing the NYSC scheme places the responsibility of provision and maintenance of orientation camps with the state governments.  “On this note, I wish to reiterate our call on them to live up to this statutory responsibility. This call has become necessary in view of the dilapidated state of the facilities in many orientation camps.”
