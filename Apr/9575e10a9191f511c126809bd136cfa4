Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano State yesterday told President Muhammadu Buhari that he would face a possible legal battle if he refuses to contest the 2019 presidential election. Speaking to newsmen in Abuja, he also declared his intention to contest the 2019 governorship election for “consolidation of on-going projects” in his state. “APC governors want Mr. President to continue. I am happy that it is not the president that said he wants to continue, it is the people that are saying, continue. But Mr. President has not made up his mind yet. “When he came to Kano, I told him that any time he decides not to contest, we will take him to court. The Kano State government will take him to court any time he decides not to contest. So, we are waiting for him. “In this country, we saw presidents who spent billions of naira for third term. So, what is the ruse about a constitutional second term?” he said. Ganduje said Kano people had implored him to pursue a re-election bid. “I am convinced that I too will seek second term and people are also urging me to do so. Eventually, it will be left to the people to decide whether I qualify or not.” Governor Ganduje, who spoke on the tenure elongation controversy in the APC, hinted that the earlier decision on the issue would be reversed during Monday’s emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party. He said the governors who hitherto backed the tenure extension idea had been convinced on the need to embrace the option of fresh congresses and national convention. “Yes, there was controversy, but we were able to put it to rest. Those advocating for tenure elongation do so on the premise that when we hold congresses and convention according to their own perception, there will be a lot of problems, and those problems will linger into election period,” he said.
