Governor Ibrahim Gaidam has announced a contribution of N200 million by the Yobe State Government for the construction of a new military barracks in the state capital, Damaturu. Gaidam made the announcement when he paid an inspection visit to the Nigeria Army Level 2 Hospital under construction in Damaturu as well as the site of the new military barracks, saying security was a collective responsibility to which the state government subscribed. “The construction of the barracks, of course, is a project of the federal government. But as we all know, security is a collective responsibility. We must do our part to support the effort of the federal government… The military continues to make sacrifices on our behalf. We must do everything to support them,” the governor said. He added that the land on which the barracks would be constructed was also provided to the army by the state government which paid another N200 million as compensation to the land owners. He said the government had earlier provided various logistics and other forms of support to the army and other security agencies. “We will continue to do everything within the limits of our resources to support you,” he said. The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 3 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major General H.E Ahanotu, told Gaidam that the barracks would include residential accommodation for officers and men of the army as well as primary and secondary schools, a sporting area, and water works.
