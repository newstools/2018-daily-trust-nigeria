The FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has presented relief materials to the 2017 flood victims in Dei Dei, Abuja. The Director General of FEMA, Abbas Garba Idris, at the event, called on residents of the affected areas to take back to their homes and communities the message of disaster prevention and avoid risky behaviours that increase vulnerability to disaster. He called for the establishment of local emergency management committees and strict adherence to weather predictions; avoiding dumping of waste in drains and building on flood plains. In his response, Bwari Area Council Chairman, Musa Dikko, directed for the setting up of a committee on emergency management to check abuse by those constructing on flood plains and warned ward and village heads against selling land in flood prone areas. Some of the items donated were bags of rice, cement and other food items. The FEMA Director, Relief and Rehabilitation, Rachel Alkali, warned beneficiaries against sale of the items. One of the beneficiaries, Aminu Yakubu Ozi Salami, who spoke on behalf of others, thanked the FCT authorities for the gesture and said they will put the items given them to good use.
