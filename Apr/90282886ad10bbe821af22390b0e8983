The Federal Government has said that issues that leads to frictions between Permanent Secretaries and other stakeholders especially ministers, the National Assembly and organised labour are mainly on disbursement of funds and procurement matters. The Acting Chairman of the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) Hon Simon Etim, said this yesterday in Abuja at an induction programme for Permanent Secretaries organised by the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (OHoCSF). This is as the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF) Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita said that the present era of dwindling financial resources and escalating competing demands is topmost among the challenges facing Permanent Secretaries. “Permanent secretaries often complain of the overbearing pressures from political heads to breach extant rules as accounting officers for which they will be held directly accountable to satisfy the financial demands of political heads. Such situation requires tact and knowledge of extant rules,” Etim said. In her keynote, Mrs Oyo-Ita said the Federal Government has started moves aimed at ending the recurring rifts between permanent secretaries and other stakeholders in public sector administration. She said the induction was part of government’s efforts to rebuild mutual trust and confidence among concerned parties to enhance service delivery to Nigerians.
