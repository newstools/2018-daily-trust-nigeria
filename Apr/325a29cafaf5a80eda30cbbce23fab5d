A Senegalese politician has been sentenced to six months in jail and ordered to pay a fine of 100,000 CFA francs ($188; £132) for “contempt of court, discrediting a judicial decision and incitement to disturb public order”. Barthélémy Dias, the mayor of the Mermoz Sacré-Cœur commune in Senegal’s capital Dakar, had hit out at last month’s sentencing of fellow politician Khalifa Sall. Mr Dias is seen as a close ally of Dakar mayor Mr Sall, who was ordered to serve five years in prison for “embezzling” $3.4m (£2.4m) worth of public funds.
