There was drama at the Chief Magistrate Court, Mpape as lawyers and policemen engaged in arguments over the hearing involving two detained lawyers and two other detainees. David Amaefula and Pius Udo-Inyang, who are of the law firm of Messrs Rickey Tarfa & Co. Abuja Office,Â were on Tuesday April 24 and 25 arrested by men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) office Guzape after they were dispatched to the Zankli Medical Centre, Mabushi, Abuja to secure justice for Senator Melaye, who was being admitted there. Two other persons including a cousin to Melaye and his friend were also arrested during the raid. Magistrate Zubairu on Monday granted the defendants bail in the sum of N200, 000 and one surety each in like sum, adding that the sureties must be resident in the FCT. Trouble started when over 50 armed policemen deployed in the court attempted to seize placards from protesting lawyers. The over 100 lawyers in the court premises resisted the move. Not done, the police officers encircled the lawyers and demanded that they leave the court premises. This attracted protests from the lawyers. Counsel to the lawyers, Mike Ozekhome (SAN) has condemned the handcuffing of the young lawyers, while being produced to the court. He said the country should resist a return to tyranny and undemocratic actions.
