Nearly one billion people will be vaccinated against yellow fever in 27 high-risk African countries by 2026, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, while launching the Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) in Africa strategy during a regional meeting of the organization. He said the strategy was aimed at eliminating yellow fever epidemics and will be done with support from Gavi- the Vaccine Alliance, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and more than 50 other partners. “There are 170,000 severe cases of yellow fever with 60,000 deaths every year,” he said. While saying that yellow fever must be a priority for Africa and the world, Dr Ghebreyesus said the EYE strategy was based on lessons learnt from previous experiences from West Africa, when mass campaigns combined with routine immunization helped to prevent yellow fever outbreaks. Minister of Health, Prof  Isaac Adewole called for a WHO regional laboratory in Nigeria, saying there were  challenges in surveillance efforts in the country because of  limited accredited laboratories.
