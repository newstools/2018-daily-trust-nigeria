Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has revealed what he says are "secret nuclear files" proving Iran is covertly pursuing nuclear weapons, reports the BBC.

He said 55,000 pages of material obtained by Israel showed Iran had deceived the world since signing a deal in 2015 to curb its nuclear programme.

It agreed to the deal in return for the lifting of sanctions.

Tweeting earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif appeared to accuse Netanyahu of "fooling people".

US President Donald Trump has long threatened to scrap the deal, which was reached under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

European powers have said they are committed to upholding the accord.
