Members of the House of Representatives on Tuesday expressed anger that President Muhammadu Buhari could expend $462 million without the National Assembly's approval.

In a letter read by Speaker Yakubu Dogara during plenary, Buhari said he gave anticipatory approval for the amount for the purchase of military ware from the United States of America. But soon after Dogara read the letter, the lawmakers took turns to say that the breach has committed constitutional breach, which could lead to impeachment.

Kingsley Chinda (PDP, Rivers), who was the first to speak, said there is no provision in the law that gives the president any power for anticipatory approval on budgetary matters. 

He said the House should waste no time in commencing an impeachment process against the president.

But the chairman of Rules and Business Committee of the House, Emmanuel Orker-Jev (APC, Benue) observed that based on the House rules, letters of this nature go through first read before they could be debated.

He said reading the letter was it first reading, urging that debate on it should be suspended.

But majority of the lawmakers rejected the suggestion with Aliyu Sani Madaki (APC, Kano), saying that Section 1 of the constitution says the content of the constitution shall be binding on everybody, and that any other law inconsistent with it is null and void.

"So, I believe that even if our rules say so, the constitution overrides that," he said.

After contributions by several lawmakers, Dogara ruled that the letter will be listed for debate where the lawmakers would make more contributions.
