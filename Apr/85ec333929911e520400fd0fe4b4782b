A mass funeral has been held for 24 school children who died when a school bus fell into a gorge in a mountainous region of India on Monday evening. Tearful relatives placed wreaths on the bodies ahead of the cremation, while some mourners asked: “What wrong have these children done?” Most of those who died were younger than 10 years old, while the bus driver and two teachers were also killed. The incident occurred in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. Road accidents are common in India, often due to poor driving or badly maintained roads and vehicles. The reasons behind the accident are not yet clear, according to an official statement.
