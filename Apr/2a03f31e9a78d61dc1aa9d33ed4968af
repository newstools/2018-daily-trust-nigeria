Senior Advocate of Nigeria Lateef Fagbemi has described the robbery attack in Offa, Offa Local Government Area of Kwara State as a national disaster. Robbers attacked five banks in Offa, killing around 30 people, including nine police officers. Police put the casualty figure at 17, others sustained injuries. Fagbemi donated N500,000 to Offa community to pay for treatment of people injured in the attack. In a condolence letter written to the Olofa of Offa, Oba Muftau Gbadamasi Esuwoye II, a copy of which was obtained by Journalists in Ilorin at the weekend, he noted that the motive of the hoodlums was to dampen the widely acclaimed resilience of Offa, saying that it would rather strengthen the ancient town's resolve to be more united, focused and to rise above any adversity. "The robbery attack coming at a time when Offa had enjoyed relative peace and accelerated development due to your purposeful leadership of the ancient town not only cast a dark cloud on Offa town but the entire nation. Offa is not just a cosmopolitan town; it is home to many people of diverse origin and culture. "Personally, my history will not be complete without Offa, which provides me with the foundation of a glorious career. As a prince of Ijagbo and an alumnus of Offa Grammar School, my commitment to the development of Offa and its environs cannot be over-emphasised. "While the perpetrators of the dastardly act may think that the incident will dampen the well known resilience of Offa people, I make bold to say that the incident will rather strengthen our resolve to be more united, focused and to rise above any adversity, including the present one. In the spirit of the ancient tradition of Offa, we as a people shall 'wrestle' all that seeks to divide us or assail our proud heritage as a peaceful and accommodating town.
