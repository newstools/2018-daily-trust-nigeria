The Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo (III), has called on FCT natives at home and in diaspora to ensure the sustenance of the Gbagyi culture and tradition. Nizazo, who was speaking at the celebration of the Gbagyi Cultural Carnival in the area on Saturday, said it was worrisome that their culture and tradition was going into extinction because of globalization. He said the Gbagyi people of the territory decided to organize and showcase their culture and tradition as a measure to sustaining and propagating them. “We are not isolated, as we are Nigerians and we must also cooperate with other ethnic groups for the development of the country,” he said. Also speaking, the chairman of the council, Mr. Joseph K. Shazin, said it was unfortunate that the Gbagyi cultural artifacts were disappearing and urged the elders to inculcate the culture and tradition into their children to enable them know how their ancestors embraced it in their time. “The reinvigoration of Gbagyi culture and its sustenance should be a point of duty especially by the elders so that the younger generation will sustain it,” he said.
