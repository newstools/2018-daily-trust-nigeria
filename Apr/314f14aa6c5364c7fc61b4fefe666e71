A 20-year-old man arrested by operatives of the Rapid Response Squad of the Lagos State police command has confessed that his gang was using a toy gun to rob motorists stranded around the Adeniji Adele end of the Third Mainland Bridge. The suspect, Rilwan Wasiu, an indigene of Oyo State, was arrested on Thursday at the Adeniji Adele under-bridge about 10.00p.m. while he was allegedly fighting with his girlfriend. The policemen, according to a police report, sighted the suspect beating his girlfriend late at night by the road side. The officers were mediating in the dispute when a toy gun fell off the body of the suspect. Wasiu was said to have attempted to run away immediately the toy gun fell but was promptly apprehended and taken to the RRS headquarters. According to the police, the suspect initially claimed he picked up the toy gun at a spot he was sleeping under the Adeniji Adele with an intention to destroyÂ  it later but got into the quarrel with his girlfriend before he could do so. On further interrogation, however, the suspect disclosed he was one of a three-man robbery team dispossessing stranded motorists and passers-by around the Adeniji Adele end of the Third Mainland Bridge of their belongings. He mentioned the two other gang members as Salami and Sakiru, who he said operated at night after working as bus conductors during the day. Commenting on the development, the Lagos State Command Police Public Relations Officer, Superintendent of Police Chike Oti, said that the deployment of more police officers by the Commissioner of Police to checkmate the activities of criminals on the Third Mainland Bridge had reduced crime in the area, adding that detectives were on the trail of other members of the gang. The suspect had been transferred to FSARS for further investigation.
