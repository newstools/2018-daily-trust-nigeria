The Constitutional Court in Uganda is hearing an opposition attempt to annul a constitutional amendment which removes presidential age limits. MPs voted last year to scrap the age limit of 75. It meant 73-year-old President Yoweri Museveni, in power for more than 30 years, could seek re-election in 2021. Opposition lawyers argued that the amendment was “smuggled” into law, and parliament had not followed proper procedures when adopting it. The petitioners include opposition MPs, the Uganda Law Society and civil society groups. They say the amendment is invalid because it was passed during parliamentary sessions marred by brawls and plain-clothes security operatives dragging MPs out of the chamber.
