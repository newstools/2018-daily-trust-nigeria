The Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) is to organise Inter-tertiary institutions students debate in the terror-stricken west and central African countries to create a broad ideas bank as a veritable source for governments and other stakeholders formulating counterinsurgency and counter-terror policies. A senior programme officer with the Centre, Isa Garba, disclosed this to newsmen at the end of the inter-tertiary institutions students debate between the University of Maiduguri and Ramat Polytechnic, Maiduguri on counterinsurgency in the Lake Chad Basin, which held in Maiduguri at the weekend. He said, at the national level, the debate, which was already held in Adamawa, would also be held in Yobe. “The essence of the debate is not to produce winners or losers, but to generate ideas from the principal actors and the main source of recruitment for terror and insurgency, the youth in tertiary institutions, on counterinsurgency,” the CITAD senior official said.
