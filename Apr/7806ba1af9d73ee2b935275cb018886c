Cuba’s parliament has picked Miguel Díaz-Canel as the sole candidate to succeed Raúl Castro, 86, bringing the family’s decades-long rule to an end. Raúl Castro took over as president from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006. The National Assembly, the country’s legislative body, will vote on the nomination but Mr Díaz-Canel is almost certain to be confirmed. Raúl Castro is expected to remain a powerful influence in the communist state even after he steps down. He is expected to formally pass the presidency to Mr Díaz-Canel after the announcement of the National Assembly’s vote on Thursday. Díaz-Canel may have had a relatively low profile when he was first appointed vice-president of Cuba’s Council of State in 2013 but he has since become Raúl Castro’s right-hand man. He was born in April 1960, little over a year after Fidel Castro was first sworn in as prime minister.
