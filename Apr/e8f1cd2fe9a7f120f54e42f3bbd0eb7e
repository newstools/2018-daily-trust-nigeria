Mr Alexander Mwolwu, Plateau PDP Chieftain has accused former President Olusegun Obansanjo of plotting to discredit the party to promote Social Democratic Party (SDP). Obasanjo, had in a statement made on Monday, told Nigerians not to take the apology offered by PDP some weeks ago serious and had described it as a corrupt political party. Mwolwus told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Pankshin that OBJ’s pronouncement is “very unfortunate’’ and “selfish in nature.” While describing PDP’s apology to Nigerians through its National Chairman as “a right step in the right direction,” he said: “Only great men own up to their mistakes.’’ “If PDP had apologized willfully haven owned up to its mistakes, I shouldn’t be castigated for that because every human organization has its own limitations. “Even though OBJ’s plots to discredit PDP to promote his own political party, SDP, he seems to have missed it and not knowing what he is doing. He is the most ungrateful and corrupt Nigerian leader, who never knew how PDP was formed. “But all the same, his party will not be anywhere close to having the confidence of Nigerians if that is the way he wants to go drumming for support to it. “Obasanjo was never a member of PDP but out to sheer pity and magnanimity, the party brought him out of prison and made him president on a platter of Gold, ’’ the chieftain alleged.
