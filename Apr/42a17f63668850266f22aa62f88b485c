Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, has faulted the notion that Nigeria’s diversity is responsible for divisiveness in the country. Speaking at the first Isawa Elaigwu Foundation Annual Distinguished Lecture in Abuja yesterday, he said blame for the problems associated with the nation’s diversity should go to Nigerians, especially the nation’s leaders over the years. The senator said it was sad that decades after Nigeria’s independence and the civil war, the crisis of identity, ethno-religious squabbles, debilitating nepotism, pampering and promotion of mediocrity, sectional segregation, and other factors that are responsible for the war have persisted. Quoted in a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, he also blamed military incursion into the country’s politics for the seeds of discord and distortion of Nigeria’s federal structure, which he said only left Nigeria a federal republic in name, but a unitary republic in practice.
