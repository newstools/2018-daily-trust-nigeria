Chairman of Northern Leaders and Stakeholders Assembly, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai on Sunday, led members of the Steering Committee to seek support of former Military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babaginda in Minna Niger State.

On the entourage of the chairman were former Speaker of House of Representatives, Ghali Umar Na’aba, two former minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Senator Bala Muhammad and Mohammed Abba Gana; former minister of commerce, Alhaji Mustapha Bello as well as Senator Waku.

Others include two former minister of women affairs, Hajiya Mayam Inna Ciroma and Hajiya Zainab Maina; former minister of National Planning, Dr Mohammed Shata, former Governor of Niger State, Dr Muazu Babaginda Aliyu and Dr Umar Ado among others.

In his address during the visit, Alhaji Yakassai said the organization was established in February 10, 2018 as a direct response to the dire need to promote the cultural and political unity among all northerners and by extension Nigeria.

“Unlike some other organizations in the North, while this body is being political, the NLSA  is however non-partisan. It is political in the sense that the door of the assembly is open to all northerners of their ethnicity, differences in religious and political belief or sectional background”, he explained.

He said although the idea to form the body came months to 2019 general elections, it has nothing to do with the elections, adding that “we are aiming far beyond this year’s electioneering”, even as he said it is not a front for any political party.

Yakasasai however said the body is interested in coming up with an agenda that would form the basis for its support for anybody who is aspiring for an elective office at any level of governance.

Responding General Babaginda commended the body for its vision of a united and prosperous Nigeria, while promising to support the initiative.
