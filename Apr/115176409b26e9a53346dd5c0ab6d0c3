Participants at a workshop on ‘Agriculture Budget Monitoring, Tracking and Advocacy’ organized by ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) have identified lack of adequate support from government, policy inconsistencies and environmental factors as some of the factors militating against agricultural development and food production especially among small scale women farmers. They also said that oil spillage, farmers/herders conflicts, lack of access to land, credit facilities, market, information and the non-involvement in policy formulation of small scale farmers by government at all levels must be addressed to ensure food security in the country. A gender and economic empowerment expert, Boyowa Roberts, said it is time for the government to come up with policies that will encourage farmers, especially the small-scale farmers, who constitute more than 70 percent of the Nigerian population. She recalled that the 2005 Maputo Declaration mandated countries to allocate 10 percent of their annual budget to agriculture and wondered why the Federal Government was only allocating two percent to the sector in the 2018 budget. An ActionAid partner and the executive director, Participation Initiative for Behavioural Change in Development (PIBCID), Gift Omoniwa, said community sponsorship of ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) is channeled towards helping the poorest of the poor who live in excluded communities across Nigeria to raise their standard of living.
