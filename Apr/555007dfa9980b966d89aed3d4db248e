The Federal Government is to partner a global agriculture firm, Bayer to control army worm invasion on maize in the country. The Desk Officer of the Maize Value Chain, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Mufutau Adeleke disclosed this at the Bayer Nigeria Maize Conference held in Abuja recently. He said the ministry was also collaborating with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) through a project known as Integrated Pest Management, aimed at fighting army worm in the country. Dr Hassan Hamidu, Lecturer, College of Agriculture and Animal Science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, who also presented a paper at the conference, advised the Federal Government to take the issue of weed management seriously, as it affects lot of farmers in the country leading to low yield and income. He said Maize is the third most important cereal crop in the world after wheat and rice and it is an important cereal crop in Nigeria with a total production of about 11.46 million tons in 2014. He added that despite its importance, the yield of maize obtained in Nigeria was far below expectation due to numerous factors, which include weed infestation, low soil fertility and unavailability of labour.
