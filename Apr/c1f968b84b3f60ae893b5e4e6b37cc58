Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have traded barbs over deadly clashes on the Gaza border. Sixteen Palestinians were killed on Friday after Israeli soldiers opened fire on some violent demonstrators. President Erdogan accused Mr Netanyahu of being “a terrorist” on Sunday. It came after Mr Netanyahu rejected Ankara’s “moral lessons” and accused Turkey of indiscriminately bombing civilians in its actions abroad. Mr Erdogan had earlier labelled the Israeli response on Friday an “inhumane attack”. “Hey Netanyahu! You are occupier. And it is as an occupier that are you are on those lands. At the same time, you are a terrorist,” Mr Erdogan said in a televised address on Sunday. The escalating war of words comes amid growing international criticism of the Israeli military response.
