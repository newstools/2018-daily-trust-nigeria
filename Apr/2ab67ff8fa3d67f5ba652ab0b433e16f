 There is pandemonium at the upper legislative chamber of the National Assembly, the Senate as unknown men stole the mace from the chamber this morning. Five persons sneaked into the chamber while DSP, Ike Ekweremadu was presiding and went away with the mace . The guys including two hefty guys ran out of the chamber through the main gate. They  jumped into a waiting jeep and drove off. The mace is a very powerful tool in the Nigerian legislative process of law making. It signifies authority and power to convene a legislative sitting. It stands as a symbol and  also used in both the states and federal house of assemblies across the Federal Republic of Nigeria to facilitate the process of law making. This tool does not only enhance the law making process but also validates law making activities. If the mace is by any chance withdrawn, ceased or broken before, on or after any law making exercise in the hallow chamber of the Nigerian national assembly then such proceedings cannot  be seen as a valid sitting. Cases of kidnapped, stolen, seized and broken mace have been witnessed in the past in some of the Nigerian law making houses of assembly.
