The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano has called on aspirants vying for governor under its platform to always be guided by the PDP constitution during their political campaigns in order to avoid
rancour and internal crisis among its members.

Speaking to Daily Trust shortly after a meeting with PDP governorship aspirants, the PDP Chairman in the state, Senator Mas’ud El-Jibril Doguwa, said the meeting was aimed at sensitising the aspirants about the PDP criteria and strategies for campaign ahead of the 2019 general
elections.

He said, “We have informed our governorship aspirants about the party’s criteria for campaign and how to use conventional and social media during their political campaigns in order to avoid rancour and internal conflicts among the party members.”

Doguwa also said the 12 governorship aspirants that attended the meeting were intimated about the problems the party was facing in the state and urged them to contribute their quota towards tackling the problems.

“We also made it clear to them that the party is supreme and that nobody among them will be on his own. The party will continue to supervise their political activities and whoever becomes its candidate
will be guided by the party constitution and ethics in his political undertakings,” he said.

He assured that whoever emerges PDP candidate would also carry other aspirants along, as according to him the business would never be as usual this time around.

Doguwa added that the 12 governorship aspirants had formed a forum with leadership among themselves during the meeting.
