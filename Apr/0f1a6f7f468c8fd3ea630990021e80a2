Death toll in last weekend herdsmen attacks on Tiv villages in Nasarawa state has risen to 78.

According to the Tiv youth president, more dead bodies have been recovered from Uluji, Ayaakeke, Uvirkaa, Usula, noting that most of the victims were those trapped in villages along Agwatashi-Jangwa road in Obi Local Government. 

“We are still searching for many of our people missing since the attacks occurred. The corpses of those killed, especially at Kertyo last Sunday and surrounding villages have not been recovered up till now that I speak with you”.
