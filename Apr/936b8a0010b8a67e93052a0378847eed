The Chief Executive Officer of the Kaduna ICT Center, Yusuf Bashir, has said that the center has trained 7, 000 youths in various technologies aimed at providing employment for the beneficiaries. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 1st KAD ICT Hub, the CEO said, “We built the hub to fill a void because we realized that there is a need to provide a place where our youths will bring their ideas and get educated on how to develop those ideas into products or companies that will employ the next millions of Nigerians that require work.” On her part, Founder, E-Kasuwa.com, Saratu Buhari, said she saw a need to connect all the small businesses on a platform with readily available logistics companies and to give them access to financial institutions because those are the two major things businesses were lacking. “E-Kasuwa.com is a platform that allows people to connect with any merchant no matter how remote and any business no matter how small. I was one of the trainees to test software from America under a company called Rentula. Rentula is a site that allows people to rent anything anywhere in the world and it was one of the things that inspired me,” she said.
