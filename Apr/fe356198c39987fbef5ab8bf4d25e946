The National Broadcasting Commission [NBC] has warned and sanctioned 121 radio stations across the country for breaching the Nigerian Broadcasting Code.

The Nigerian Television Authority, Channels Television, Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria [FRCN] and African Independent Television [AIT] were prominent among the sanctioned broadcasting stations for contravening the broadcasting rules.  

Their names were contained in the quarterly list of broadcasting stations that contravened the provisions of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code for the 1st Quarter, 2018 released by NBC at the weekend.

All the mentioned stations have been either queried or sanctioned, according to the provisions of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code, a statement by the NBC’s acting head of public affairs, Ekanem Antia, said.

NBC said 70 stations have been fined for violations bordering on inciting political and hateful broadcasts, 22 for vulgar lyrics on musicals and videos, with 29 for trado-medic advertisements and unverifiable claims.
