The National Orientation Agency (NOA) has advocated for an alternative narrative to counter the spread of hate and violence which is being portrayed by the sponsors of terrorism as religious. The Director-General of the agency, Dr Garba Abari stated this when a delegation from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (MCTC) led by Brigadier-General Abdullah Al-Fehaid visited the NOA headquarters in Abuja, a statement by the agencyâ€™s head of press, Paul Odenyi said. Abari said the two major sects in Islam, the Sunnis and Derik needed to work together on a scholarly response to the Boko Haram ideology relying mainly on the Quran and the Hadith. Team leader of the Saudi delegation, Brigadier Al Fehaid agreed with the NOA DG saying the team was in the country to strategise and unite with members of the coalition countries and complement their efforts to eradicate violent and radical ideologies. Al-Fehaid said the 2018 work plan is to leverage and enhance coalition engagement and communication, seek impactful initiative and strengthen institutional capacity among member countries.
