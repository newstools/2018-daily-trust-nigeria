A housewife, simply identified as Hadiza, has been killed by a grinding machine at Rubochi village, Kuje Area Council, Abuja. The incident happened at about 4:00pm last Wednesday. A witness, Jethro Samuel, said the deceased had gone to Rubochi from neighbouring Pesu village to grind some grains. Samuel said the deceased had bent to lift a bowl of maize to give to the machine operator when the engine belt caught her hijab and pulled her to the running engine. He said the woman died instantly despite the effort of the operator by switching off the machine immediately. He said other women who had brought their grains abandoned them due to the incident. He said relatives of the deceased took away the corpse for burial according to Islamic rites. The Rubochi Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP John Kareem, confirmed the incident, which he described as an accident. “It was an accident. The engine belt hooked her hijab which suddenly cut off her head and she died instantly,” he said. Kareem said the deceased has been handed over to her relatives for burial, even as he advised women with hijab to be always extra-carefull in such places.
