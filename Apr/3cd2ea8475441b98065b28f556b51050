The Niger State Government says it has spent N787 million in the revitalization of the health sector with special attention on the colleges of nursing sciences in Bida, Minna and Kontagora. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Abubakar Sani Bello quoted the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Dr. Makusidi Muhammad as saying that the effort led to the full accreditation of School of Nursing Bida, 42 years after its establishment. “With the going revitalization of the health sector, the 42-year-old School of Nursing, Bida and School of Midwifery, Minna have been granted full accreditation for the first time since they were established  while the newly established College of Nursing Sciences, Kontagora has also been accredited,” the statement said. The statement said the accreditation had raised the number of students to be admitted into the schools which would reduce the hardship faced by young Nigerlites seeking admission in such schools outside the state. “It will also improve the availability of manpower in health care facilities across the state,” the statement said. It disclosed that the School of Nursing Bida had been chosen to be among the six schools in Nigeria to pilot the HND program for nurses while that of Minna was among those schools to handle special training for special students.
