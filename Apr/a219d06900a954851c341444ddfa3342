The socio-cultural umbrella body of the Tiv people, Mdzough u Tiv, has asked all the security chiefs in Nigeria to resign, saying they have failed the nation. President General of the group, Engr. Edward Ujege, said in Makurdi on Wednesday that the continued killings of Tiv people across some states in the country was an indication of genocide against the race. "It is genocide to exterminate the Tiv race. I therefore call on the security chiefs in the country to resign because they have failed the nation," he said. Ujege also said that President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has failed in securing the lives of Nigerians such that most citizens have now lost confidence in the administration. He noted that the continued killings in Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa states has left the people frustrated as he urged those at the receiving end not to hesitate in defending themselves with stones as recently advised by Governor Samuel Ortom.
