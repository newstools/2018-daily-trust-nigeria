The governor of Borno State, Kassim Shettima, says President Muhammadu Buhari is the man to beat in the 2019 presidential election.


Shettima said this in an interview with State House correspondents today after meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari.


The governor was responding to the president's declaration for second term at the National Executive Committee meeting of the All Progressives Congress earlier today.


Shettima said Buhari did not need to consult anybody before declaring his intention because as the sitting president, he has the right of first refusal.


He also stated that all the governors elected on the platform of the party were in support of Buhari's second term ambition.
