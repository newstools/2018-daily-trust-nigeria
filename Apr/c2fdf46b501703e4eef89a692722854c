The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has debunked reports that Sharia is enforced on corps members at the orientation camp in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). A national newspaper, not Daily Trust, had reported on Tuesday that Sharia was introduced in the camp banning the sale of alcoholic drinks and socialisation among corps members. In a statement signed by the Director, Public Relations Department, Adenike Adeyemi, the service urged residents to disregard the report, describing it as false. She said that the NYSC scheme runs a prototype policy in all orientation camps nationwide hence the camps are coordinated with a uniform timetable as well as freedom of worship for both Muslim and Christian corps members. She said the report negated the essence of the scheme as it was not possible for any camp management to stop the social integration of corps members in an orientation camp, stressing that corps members were grouped into platoons which comprised both males and females who carried out all camp activities together.
