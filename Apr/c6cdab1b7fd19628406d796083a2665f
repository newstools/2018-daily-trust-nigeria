The  Presidential Committee on North-East Initiative said it had offered  free medical treatment to hundreds of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the North-East region of Nigeria.  The North- East region has been targeted by the Boko Haram insurgents who have destroyed many communities over the years.  Head of Media and Communications of PCNI, Alkasim Abdulkaddri said the medical services included surgeries, dental care and screenings in six states of North-East region; Borno, Adamawa, Yobe, Taraba, Gombe  and Bauchi states.  Abdulkaddri who spoke with journalists at a 3-day workshop in Damaturu, Yobe State, on Tuesday said PCNI was currently rebuilding communities that were  destroyed by the Boko Haram insurgents.  “Bama  was a community that was 100 per cent destroyed, but at the moment, I  can  tell you that we have been able to rebuild it up to 90 per cent  level.  "This reconstruction was done by the help of the state government,  the International agencies, help of organisations like the Victims  Supports Funds and also, PCNI,” he stated.  He  stated that the agency would continue to reconstruct areas that were  deemed safe and also persuade the displaced people to return to areas that have been certified safe by the military.  Abdulkaddri  further explained that the PCNI had been able to address the shortage  of medical personnel in the North-East in conjunction with the state  governments.
