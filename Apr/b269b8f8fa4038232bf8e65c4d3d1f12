The former President, Olusegun Obasanjo-led executive, paid members of the House of Representatives N500,000 each to impeach a former Speaker of the House, Ghali Umar Na’Abba. This was revealed yesterday by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Interior, Hon. Jagaba Adams Jagaba, while testifying before an FCT High Court in Lugbe in the ongoing trial of Hon. Farouk Lawan who was accused of bribery during the fuel subsidy saga. Answering questions from Lawan’s Counsel, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), Jagaba told the court that the money was brought by the executive arm of government to bribe members of the National Assembly and that it was specifically to impeach the then Speaker, Na’Abba. He said he reported the matter to the house during plenary and displayed the money. “I displayed N4.5m on the floor of the house because every member was involved and the matter was reported. I believed it was a bribe because I saw trucks coming to distribute the money. It was N500,000 per person. It was nine members that tendered their money as exhibit,” he said.
