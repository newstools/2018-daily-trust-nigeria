German airline, Lufthansa, cancelled more than 800 flights yesterday with more flights expected to be cancelled following industrial action by its trade union at four airports. The Verdi trade union strike, it was gathered, affected Frankfurt, Munich, Cologne and Bremen airports. Daily Trust learnt that the strike also affected the flights to Nigeria which were cancelled on Monday. The Lagos and Port Harcourt-bound flights arrived from Germany yesterday, but the return flights last night were cancelled as a result of the strike. Also, another flight to Abuja was affected with over 1000 passengers affected throughout the country. A media consultant to the airline, Hakeem Jimo, confirmed the development in a chat with our correspondent on Monday, saying passengers had already been informed of the cancellations. Jimo said, “The two flights are cancelled today. We have informed all passengers that were supposed to go today. So tomorrow (Tuesday) there is no arrival and the next arrival would be on Wednesday.” With the strike in the Lufthansa hub, the ground handling services, the support services and also part of the airport fire brigade will be on strike tomorrow between 5:00h and 18:00h. The airline, in a statement extracted from its website, said, “Due to this Verdi strike tomorrow Lufthansa will have to cancel 800 out of the 1,600 scheduled flights, including 58 long-haul flights. The cancellations will affect about 90,000 passengers. Flight operations are scheduled to resume normal services on Wednesday 11, April 2018.” The airline group condemned the resort to strike. “Lufthansa cannot comprehend Verdi’s threat to carry out such a massive strike,” said a Member of the Executive Board for Human Resources and Legal Affairs of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Bettina Volkens.
