The Akwa Ibom State government has marked the building housing the National Committee of Buhariâ€™s Support Groups secretariat for demolition two days after the office was inaugurated. It is located along Wellington Bussey where the Government House is also situated. A source said that by marking the building for demolition, the government would first revoke its Certificate of Occupancy. It was learnt that the state government had asked the Commissioner of Police and the Director of Department of State Service to stop the inauguration of the NCBSG office but they were said to have told the government that they would provide security during the event. The state government was said to have taken the decision to demolish the building on the premise that it does not have a Certificate of Occupancy. When the Chairman of Uyo City Capital Development Chairman, Mr. Enobong Uwah was contacted on phone, he did not pick his call or answer the text message sent to him. He was not also in his office when some journalists visited. Effort to speak with the state coordinator of the NCBSG, Mr. Ignatius Edet was unsuccessful as he dropped his call after the issue was mentioned to him.
