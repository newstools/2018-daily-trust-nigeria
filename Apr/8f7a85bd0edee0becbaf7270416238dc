A lymphatic malformation is a mass in the head or neck that results from the abnormal formation of lymphatic vessels, which carry fluids to the lymph nodes. They are present from birth and occur when vessels become blocked or enlarge during a woman’s pregnancy. Lymphatic malformations may not be noticeable until they become infected and enlarged. This may affect a sufferer’s breathing and swallowing. Treatment may include antibiotics to cure infections, draining the lesion or surgery to remove the growth. Some lymphatic malformations regrow within a year of surgery. This is more common in those that are large and complicated. Source: Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford
