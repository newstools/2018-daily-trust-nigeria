The African Development Bank (AfDB) and the African Institute of Mathematics and Sciences (AIMS) have partnered to groom about 250 mathematical scientists across each of the 45 African countries by 2020 to lead research and innovation. A statement from AfDB’s Communications Officer, Emeka Anuforo, said former President Olusegun Obasanjo, led a delegation of the high-level advisory council of AIMS to a meeting with the bank in Abidjan, where the 10-year partnership proposal worth $54.6 million was made to build mathematical and scientific capacity in Africa. “If we are going to make substantial progress in industrialization within the next decade, be truly visible in the rapidly unfolding fourth industrial revolution and rise effectively to the challenge of creating decent and sustainable jobs for our youth, the continent must produce well motivated and well trained young innovators,” Obasanjo said. AfDB President, Akinwumi Adesina, stressed the need for Africa to develop with pride and pledged the bank’s commitment towards the partnership. “We must recognize that the world is moving fast. We are excited about the focus on young people. We also like the regional integration dimension of the work that AIMS does,” he said. Neil Turok, founder of AIMS said, “I was trained to believe in Africa. What has driven the institution are the young students from Africa.”
