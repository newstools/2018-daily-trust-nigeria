The FCT Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Corps Commander Ayuba Agora Wobin, has cautioned commercial cyclists against riding motorcycles under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Wobin made the call while addressing members of the commercial motorcycle riders drawn from Tungan Maje, Anagada, Dei-Dei, Gwagwa and Zuba, at the FRSC command office in Zuba on Tuesday. He also warned the cyclists over riding against traffic, saying most of the accidents recorded within Zuba axis were caused by cyclists who rode against traffic. He stressed the need for the ‘Okada’ riders to ensure they obtained their riding permits, adding that they should also ensure they wore helmets to save themselves from fatal injuries in the event of accident. He said most of the accidents involving motorcycles and vehicles were as a result of the negligent attitude of some Okada riders, saying some of them rode recklessly when under the influence of alcohol and drugs. “You must also try to obtain your driving permit from the FRSC and obtain yours number plates which will have the details of your motorcycle in case it is stolen,” he said.
