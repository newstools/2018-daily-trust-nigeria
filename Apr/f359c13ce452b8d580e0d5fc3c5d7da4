The Coalition of Wives of Presidents and Vice Presidents in Africa for Peace (COWAP) has awarded Jose Foundation, a non-governmental organization, for its effort in fighting extreme poverty in Africa. The foundation was honoured at the 2018 COWAP Women Summit in Abuja, which brought together female leaders across the continent. The two-day Summit themed, “Using Innovative Technology to Solve Africa’s Development Challenges” brainstormed on ideas towards achieving peace and development in Africa, anchoring on the four thematic points of COWAP – Peace; Girl Child Education; Ending Hunger and Ending Poverty. COWAP project lead, Meshack-Hart Kalada said Jose Foundation was awarded in recognition of its efforts in promoting women’s economic and social development in Africa, which she said was in line with the coalition’s development goal of putting an end to poverty in all its forms. Kalada also commended the founder of Jose Foundation, Prince Dr. Martins Abhulimhen, for emerging as 2018 overall “Champion in the Ending Extreme Poverty” category. The foundation’s Country Director in Nigeria, Dr. Eunice Ameh-Pius, who received the award on behalf of its founder, said Jose Foundation is committed to ending child sexual exploitation in Nigeria. “The award will propel us to do more for the good of women, children and the vulnerable in the society. Jose Foundation, founded in 2003, campaigns against child labour and sexual exploitation of minors and women to live a meaningful and fulfilling life in a more equitable and safer environment.
