The Lagos State Police Command yesterday said an autopsy report has revealed that Nigerian singer, Zainab Nielsen died from trauma which she suffered as a result of impact on her head. Zainab and her daughter, Petral were reportedly found dead on Thursday, April 5 at their Banana Island residence, Ikoyi where she resided with her Danish husband, Peter Nielsen. The Commissioner of Police, CP Edgal Imohimi, who gave an update on the issue yesterday, said reports from forensic experts revealed that there were blood stains from the couples’ bedroom to the kitchen. “Even though it was cleverly wiped from the floor, they were still able to detect it with the application of special chemical reagents. “Blood stains were also discovered on the washing hand basins and on the hand towel the suspect (Nielsen) used in wiping his hands after the commission of the offence. Although it was cleverly cleaned up as well, the experts were able to discover that too,” he said. Imohimi added that further forensic examinations were being carried out to be used in evidence against the suspect who had since been remanded in prison on the order of a magistrate’s court in Yaba. Lagos State police spokesman, Chike Oti, who spoke on the matter on the day of the incident said police opened investigation into the matter based on a complaint from the facility manager of Bellasta Tower, Banana Island, Mr. Kunle  Kukoyi. Oti said the manager alleged that he was informed by one Gift Madaki, 13, who was the deceased’s younger sister that she heard her elder sister crying in the early hours of the day she died.
