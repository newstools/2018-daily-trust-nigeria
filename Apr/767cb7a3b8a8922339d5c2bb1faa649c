An Egyptian military court has sentenced a former anti-corruption chief, Hisham Geneina, to five years in jail, charged with spreading news that harms the army. The military detained Geneina in February following an interview he gave to Huffpost Arabi, the Arabic version of the US news site. In the interview he said former armed forces chief General Sami Anan possessed documents that were damning of senior Egyptian officials. He gave no details. Geneina, a qualified judge, was sacked by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as head of the Central Auditing Authority in 2016 after he was accused of exaggerating the cost of corruption in Egypt. His lawyers told news agencies that he is filing an appeal.
