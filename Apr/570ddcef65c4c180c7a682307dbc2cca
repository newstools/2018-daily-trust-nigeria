The Air Officer Commanding, Tactical Air Command (TAC) in Benue State, AVM Oladayo Amao, has assured that the state would soon overcome its current security challenges. Amao emphasised that insecurity plaguing Benue and the country at large would be overcome within the next few days, urging residents not to despair. He made the remark during the Interdenominational Faith Service organized to commemorate the 54th anniversary of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) held at the NAF Protestant Church, NAF Base in Makurdi. Represented by the Commandant, Nigerian Air Force School of Air Intelligence (NAFSAINT,) Air Commodore Samuel Chinda, the AOC, noted that the leadership of NAF was already making arrangements to ensure that the palpable fear in the state occasioned by the incessant killings by armed bandits becomes a thing of the past in the next few days. Earlier, Chaplain of the St. Lawrence Catholic Church, Rev. Fr. Cyril Akor, maintained that every profession that exists in the world is linked to Jesus Christ as he enjoined officers, airmen and air women of NAF to carry out their duty with the fear of God. In a similar vein, a Jumaat service was earlier held at the NAF Base Central Mosque on Friday for the 2018 NAF day celebration.
