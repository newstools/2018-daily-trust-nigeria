The only member of the APC in the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Gboyega Aribisogan, has been arrested by security agents and whisked to Abuja. The lawmaker, who according to findings, was reportedly arrested around 6.30am on Wednesday, defected from the PDP to the APC last year. Before his defection, Aribisogan was suspended by the PDP-dominated House of Assembly which members accused him of disloyalty to Gov. Ayo Fayose. His arrest was confirmed by his younger brother, Sola, in a telephone chat with reporters in Ado Ekiti. Sola said about 10 security men from the Police, Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and the Department of State Services (DSS) effected the arrest. He disclosed that the lawmaker might have been arrested to give clarification on some “sensitive” stories carried by his newspaper, New Democrat. “The security men came in a Toyota Hummer bus, they did not search the house, but they only showed their identity cards. They arrived at about 6.00am and left at 7.35am.” The APC Publicity Secretary in the state, Taiwo Olatunbosun, said although he heard of the arrest, he said he was yet to be briefed.
