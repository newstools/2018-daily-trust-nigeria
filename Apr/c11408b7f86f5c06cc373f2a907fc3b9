You must never give up on your passion to succeed! This is the advice given by Asma’u Aminu Garo, founder of Husnagaro fashion line, whose ‘Indulgence’ brand is gaining vast attention in Nigeria. In an encounter with Daily Trust YOUTHVILLE, Asma’u said designing was always her passion. “I used to design clothes for my dolls when I was younger, so I practiced a lot and it helped grow my passion.” She decided to make it a profession after she obtained a diploma in fashion from Esmod French fashion institute in Dubai, the graduate of International Relations from Baze University, Abuja said. The 24-year-old Kano State indigene then started proper in 2015. “That propelled me to release my first collection in August 2015, while I was still in the fashion school,” Asma’u said. Her models include Zac Posen and Coco Chanel as she noted that her passion is the biggest motivation for the business. While appreciating her supportive family, Asma’u said for anyone to excel in their field, they must practice a lot, work hard and have lots of patience. She made her first collection with just N30,000, money she saved from her allowances while in fashion school. Asma’u, who targets young ladies as customers, said professional fashion business pays as she plans to start kiddies’ collection and design for older ladies. “Culture and religion bring limitations to contemporary designs. Whatever I design has to conform to my religion as a Muslim and culture as a Hausa-Fulani, and therefore it limits my designs “Another challenge is that with the social media pandemic these days, it is very difficult to actually keep the originality of my designs within my label,” she said. She urged youth to acquire skills, find their talents and develop them into profit making ventures. The young employer also urged those in business never to give up, stressing that “there would be bad days but you shouldn’t give up; keep going and it would be worth it in the end.”
