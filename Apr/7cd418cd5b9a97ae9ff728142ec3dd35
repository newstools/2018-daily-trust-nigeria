Four employees of Kazmus Nigeria Limited were yesterday charged before an Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court for defiling the three-year-old and five-year-old daughters of their colleague. The offence, according to the state prosecutor, Ms I. Solarin,  violated Sections 137 and 259 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2011. The suspects Ojo Taiye, 35, a driver, John Mohasan,  24, a security guard, Peter Arabo, 33, a tiler and Adenekan Adedeji, 40, a driver, all pleaded not guilty before Justice Mrs Sybil Nwaka on a three-count charge of defilement and sexual assault by penetration. The state prosecutor,  Ms I. Solarin, said the employees committed the offences in November 2015 at the company’s premises located at Fagba-Iju Road,  Agege, Lagos. “The defendants on several occasions defiled the sisters (names withheld) by having sexual intercourse with them. They also on different occasions sexually assaulted the older sister who is five-years old by penetrating her mouth with their penises,” Solarin said. According to court documents, the children who are nursery and primary school pupils used to spend time at their father’s workplace after school hours. The children were on several occasions, left in the company of the suspects and other members of staff to babysit them while their father (name withheld) worked. It was when the children were left alone with the defendants that the defilements allegedly took place. The three-year-old sibling who was said to be experiencing pains in her private part, was first to disclose that she was defiled to her father. The father, on further enquiries,  found out that his older daughter was also defiled by his colleagues. The judge Justice Sybil Nwaka ordered that the defendants be remanded in prison custody. She subsequently adjourned the matter until April 27, 2018 for trial.
