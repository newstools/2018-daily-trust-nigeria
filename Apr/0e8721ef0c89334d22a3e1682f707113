Detectives attached to the homicide section of the Lagos State Criminal Investigations Department (SCID), Yaba have commenced discreet investigation into the circumstance that led to the death of unidentified middle aged man on Wednesday. It was learnt that the unfortunate incident occurred at Isheri Osun area of Idimu. The deceased was allegedly stabbed to death by a young man over N50 change. A police source at SCID said that the suspect had allegedly lost control of himself when the deceased, a petty trader, allegedly told him to be patient so that he could look for change for him. According to the source, the suspect had handed over N100 note to the deceased after buying N50 worth of item. The source said that the suspect became angry while the victim went out to look for change, insisting that the deceased was delaying him unnecessarily. A disagreement, however, between them ensued and in the process, the suspect grabbed a bottle, smashed it on the floor and stabbed the victim on the head. It was learnt that the victim bled to death before he could be rushed to hospital. Doctors at Igando General Hospital confirmed the victim dead on arrival and his body was deposited at the mortuary. The suspect had attempted to bolt away but was apprehended by his neighbours who consequently handed him over to the police at Isheri Oshun Division. When contacted, the Area Commander, Area M Idimu, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Augustines Akika, confirmed the incident but declined to make further comment.
