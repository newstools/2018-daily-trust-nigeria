The Senate and House of Representatives have resolved to constitute  a joint committee to investigate the invasion of the Senate last Wednesday. Speaking on the matter yesterday, Senate President Bukola Saraki said “We also resolved on the need to tighten the security at the National Assembly and I’m calling on all members of the public to please cooperate with us. Clearly, there are some loopholes here and we need to tighten it. “We also directed our committee on security, intelligence and police to engage the Director of the DSS and the Inspector General of Police to look at how to strengthen the security of the National Assembly.” The House of Representatives resolved to constitute a special ad-hoc panel to probe the circumstances that led to last week’s invasion of the Senate chamber by some thugs, who made away with the Mace. The House said the ad-hoc panel would work jointly with a similar committee of the Senate to unravel the matter. Speaker Yakubu Dogara said no amount of anger that should make any member of the National Assembly contemplate, much less procure thugs to invade the Legislature to perpetrate such action.
