Senator Matthew Uroghide has alleged that he was molested and humiliated by supporters of APC at the Benin Airport, on Friday, over his motion on President Buhari’s impeachment during plenary. The PDP senator representing Edo South Senatorial District in the National Assembly made the allegation while addressing journalists at the weekend, in Benin. “They have promised to deal with me. If not for the state Commissioner of Police, I don’t know what would have happened. I obeyed the police commissioner by staying where I was until the governor came. We were walking side by side talking when a boy hit my head and the governor walked away,” he said. He said he would seek redress in court and also furnish the Senate with information on how he was molested, humiliated and being crucified over what he said during plenary.
