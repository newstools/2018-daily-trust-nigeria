The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has decorated the Chief Security Officer (CSO), in the Office of the FCT Minister, Rasheed Ahmed, with the new rank of Superintendent of Police (SP). Malam Bello, assisted by the FCT Commissioner of Police, Sadiq Bello, during the brief rank decoration ceremony, which also had in attendance the Police Commissioner, K-9 Division of the Nigeria Police, Dr. Aishatu Abubakar, said the event was a mark of appreciation for SP Ahmed’s hard work as well as a testimonial to the fact that the officer represented the new face of the Nigeria Police Force. The minister, while congratulating the CSO for the promotion, also acknowledged the role some senior officers who had supervised him played in training and grooming the young officer through his career and previous elevations. Bello, who described SP Ahmed as a very unassuming, easy going but highly effective intelligence officer, charged him to continue to exhibit such virtues and exemplary qualities for the young ones to emulate. The minister tasked the newly elevated officer to also identify other younger officers to groom, the way he has been mentored. “That is what we call mentorship and leadership development, and this differentiates those who are managers from those who are just ordinary officers,” he said.
