Joint retirees of police officers and other paramilitary agencies at the weekend accused the Senate of being insensitive to their plight following a delay by the National Assembly to pull them out of the contributory pension scheme, Pencom. Daily Trust reports that the retirees are asking the National Assembly to amend the Pension Reform Act 2014 to exclude the Nigeria Police and other paramilitary organisation from the scheme and other related matters. The retirees stated at the end of a joint meeting of the Nigeria Police, Immigration, Custom and other paramilitary pensioners held in Jos, that seven months after a public hearing on the pending bill, nothing has been heard from the Senate. The National Secretary of police retirees, ASP Silvanus Basadeimbo (Rtd) who spoke on behalf of the joint retirees, said based on members resolution, the retirees were left with no other option than to stage a peaceful protest to the National Assembly. “Peaceful protest as suggested by our members might be the last and only options for us because when you talk and talk and exhausted all legal avenues, you are left with no option than to go on peaceful demonstration at the National Assembly so that the world will hear, see and decides wither we are right or wrong,” he threatened. He described as unfortunate that police and other paramilitary retirees were today given peanuts despite contributing to their successful retirement.
