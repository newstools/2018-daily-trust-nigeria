The Police in Delta State saved the Chevron Escravos Flow Station of what could have resulted in a devastation when it detonated a 2kg seismic dynamite. According to the Delta State Commissioner of Police, Muhammad Alhaji Mustafa, the bombing plot was revealed through credible information. He said some hoodlums had planted objects suspected to be improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the Chevron Escravos Flow Station. “The Command’s IED experts were deployed to the scene and uncovered a 2kg seismic dynamite, electric detonator, 13 meters wire connected to the base of oil pumping pipe. “They discovered that the objects were IEDs planted at the base of the flow pump ostensibly designed to cause serious collateral damage as the petroleum product in the pipe could have caused serious conflagration on the facilities”, CP Mustafa stated, adding that investigation into the case was on.
