  A video by Cambridge Analytica showing violent imagery to portray Muhammadu Buhari as a supporter of ‘Sharia’ law who would brutally suppress dissenters and negotiate with militant Islamists has emerged. Published by Guardian of London, the video highlights activities surrounding the Nigerian presidential election in 2015. It was obtained from a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who passed the video to British MPs. Last week Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee said: “Cambridge Analytica sent AggregateIQ the video after they [CA] got banned from several online ad networks because the graphic nature of the content violated the terms of service. AIQ was quite freaked out about it. It’s a very disturbing video. They told Cambridge Analytica that. They called it ‘the murder video’ “[The video was distributed] in Nigeria with the sole intent of intimidating voters. It included content where people were being dismembered, where people were having their throats cut and bled to death in a ditch. They were being burned alive. There was incredibly anti-Islamic, threatening messages portraying Muslims as violent.” Wylie also said Cambridge Analytica directed AggregateIQ (AIQ), the Canadian digital services firm that worked for Vote Leave during Britain’s EU referendum, to target voters with the video during the Nigerian presidential campaign.
