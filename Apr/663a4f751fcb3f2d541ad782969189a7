The Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ekwe Ibas yesterday said only 6000 naval personnel representing 30 percent of its total force have decent accommodations. He was speaking at the commissioning of the Nigerian Navy Officers quarters at Kubwa, Abuja. Ibas said the new quarters would house about 66 officers and their families, saying if deliberate steps were not taken to address the accommodation needs of officers it would worsen. He appealed to the Ministry of Defence to accord the Nigerian Navy appropriate considerations in the intervention projects of barracks provisions. The Permanent Secretary in the ministry of defence, Nuratu Batagarawa, while commissioning the project expressed hope that the accommodation would boost the morale and operational efficiency of the personnel. She said “In view of the Navy peculiar inadequate barrack accommodation situation, more consideration will need to be given to ensure delivery of more living quarters to NN personnel.”
