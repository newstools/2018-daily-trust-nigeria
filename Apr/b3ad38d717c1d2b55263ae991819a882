President Muhammadu Buhari has reassured Nigerians that the nation’s unity remains his paramount objective. Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, quoted Buhari as saying this yesterday at the Presidential Villa in Abuja while receiving the Tijjaniya Movement led by Sheikh Muhammadu Mahi Ibrahim Inyass. He commended the religious group for the peaceful conduct of their annual convention and urged them to bring the same to bear in promoting peace, unity and inter-religious harmony in Nigeria. The leader of the group, Sheikh Muhammadu Mahi Ibrahim Inyass, told Buhari that members of the group would continue to support and appreciate his ‘‘noble agenda for the benefit of all Nigerians,’’  because they believe elected officials must be ‘‘accountable, incorruptible and God fearing.’’
