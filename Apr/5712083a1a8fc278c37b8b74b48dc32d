The FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has commended the Gade natives of the territory for embracing their culture and tradition. Bello, who was represented by his special assistant on community relations, Abuzarri Ribadu, at the occasion of 2018 National Gade Cultural Festival held in Kuje on Saturday, said he was impressed with the colourful displays of Gade natives. He said he was delighted to be part of the Gade cultural festival, saying the role of culture in carving out identity by the people could not be over emphasized. He said the Gade natives were peaceful people that have made viable contribution to the development of Nigeria in general and Abuja in particular. Also speaking, the Gomo of Kuje, Alhaji Haruna Jibrin Tanko, who was the chief host at the occasion, said the Gade natives had a rich cultural heritage that had been lying fallow and untapped over the years. He said it was on that premise that the Gade natives decided to come together to present and uplift the status and cultural relevance of the Gade people in the contemporary Nigeria. “Today, the Gade tribe is predominantly found in the FCT and in some part of Nasarawa and Niger states, as these unique set of people have farming, hunting and weaving as their occupation,” he said. On his part, a former FCT senator, Usman Jibrin Wowo, said the Gade cultural festival would go a long  way  to contribute towards peaceful coexistence among not only the Gade natives but other ethnic groups in the territory. “I believe if there is no peace and unity among the Gade people, it will not be easy to see this kind of crowd that are here today,” he said.
