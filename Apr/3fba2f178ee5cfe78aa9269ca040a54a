Politicians in Berlin have recommended changing street names that are associated with the bloody suppression of Namibians by the German colonial powers. The idea of changing the street names in what is known as the “African Quarter” of the German capital has long been debated but now politicians from different parties have agreed to the move. Historians refer to it as the first genocide of the 20th Century - when German colonisers killed thousands of people from the Herero and Nama ethnic groups in what was then South-West Africa. Roads in Berlin’s African Quarter bear the names of the men responsible for those crimes - like Lüderitzstraße - after Franz Adolf Lüderitz, the founder of South West Africa. Now they are likely to be with replaced with names like Anna Kakurukaze Mungunda, a Herero woman who played a key role in Namibia’s independence movement.
