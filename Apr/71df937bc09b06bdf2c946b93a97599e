The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, has described generalization of the whole race of Fulani as bad as a grievous injustice, saying that they would not be ashamed to be called Fulani. Speaking in his palace during the formal swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected leadership of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), the monarch insisted that Fulani were apostles of peaceful coexistence. “We are not ashamed to be called Fulani because Fulani are not trouble makers although any wrongdoing in Nigeria now is erroneously said to be by Fulani,” he said, stressing that though there might be bad ones amongst the Fulani “just like there are in every race,” it was wrong to generalize  that all Fulani were bad. Sultan Sa’ad who is the grand patron of MACBAN wondered why the media were silent when Fulani were killed in some parts of the country. He tasked the newly elected executives of MACBAN on the need for peaceful coexistence. Responding on behalf of all the newly elected officers after the oath of office was administered on them by Barrister Abdulrahman Harande Tsamiya, the National President of MACBAN, Mohammed Kirowa, appealed to Fulani people to continue to embrace peaceful coexistence.
