Abductors of the two brides and a man kidnapped at a village in Birnin-Gwari, Kaduna State have made a demand of N5 million on the family before they can be released. The two women were abducted from their homes when some armed men stormed their village about two weeks ago. Malam Mohammed Aliyu, who spoke on behalf of the family, said his two sisters and brothers have been in the custody of their abductors for 11 days. He said the abductors contacted the family and demanded for N10 million a few days after the incident  but that after days of negotiation, they brought the amount down to N5 million. “We are appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Senator Shehu Sani and our House of Representatives and State Assembly members to come to our aid because we don’t have that kind of money,” he said. Efforts to reach the police by our correspondent was not successful.
