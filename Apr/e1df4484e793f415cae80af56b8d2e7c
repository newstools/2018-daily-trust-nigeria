Mysterious fire on Monday, March 26, 2018, razed a newly commissioned tuberculosis reference medical laboratory at the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Training Centre (NTLTC) Saye, Zaria. The facility, which has the capacity to handle medical tests hitherto taken abroad, was only commissioned on March 9 by the Minister of State for Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire. The Acting Registrar of the Medical Laboratory Science Council (MLSC), Dr. Torsan Erhabor, during the commissioning of the laboratory, had said it was constructed by the National External Quality Assurance in Partnership with Institute of Human Virology to handle complicated tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, leprosy and malaria tests. Although the principal of the NTLTC, Dr. Labaran Shehu, said the cause of the fire was not known, a source at the centre described the fire as mysterious. The source added; “our suspicion was that the fire started from one of the machines in the laboratory and quickly engulfed the whole complex. We are however saying that the fire was mysterious because this laboratory is the biggest in Africa. The only country that has a similar facility is South Africa. However, theirs is not as big as the one we have here in Zaria. So, if you have this kind of facility, I think a serious management would have put measures in place to curb this kind of incident.” He said the laboratory was fully equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, which attracts patronage from other countries despite the short life span of the facility. He said; “this is a great loss for Nigeria and Africa. As at the time of the incident, there were samples brought in from America for test. This is to tell you the capacity of the facility.” Eyewitness account revealed that the fire started around noon and it took the combined efforts of the Kaduna State Fire Service and Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH) fire personnel to put off the inferno.
