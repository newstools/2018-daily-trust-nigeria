The Lagos State Government on Wednesday said it has completed the construction and rehabilitation of 450 major roads and 50 other impactful projects in the last three years. Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Engr. Adebowale Akinsanya who said this at the ongoing Ministerial Press Briefing held at the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre in Alausa as part of activities to mark the third year anniversary of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode’s administration, said aside the completed projects, several others were at various stages of completion and would contribute to the vision to make Lagos emerge as Africa’s model smart city and global economic and financial hub. He said provision of world class infrastructural facilities to support the growing population of the state has been one of the cardinal programmes of the Ambode’s administration, and that it was gratifying that the effort was serving the intended purpose. “In the course of the three years, we have vigorously pursued the maintenance of existing roads, the rehabilitation and expansion of highways, as well as the construction of new bridges. We have continually worked to deliver projects that will directly impact on the lives of all Lagosians. This commitment to infrastructural renewal, expansion, upgrading and regeneration is borne out of the fact that an efficient and integrated transportation system can only be birthed through the provision of appropriate infrastructure,”  he said. He revealed that the state government has completed between 450 and 500 road projects and they still have a lot in stock for the people while about 60 or 70 projects are on-going. Giving a list of some of the road projects completed in the last one year, Akinsanya said the state government delivered pedestrian bridges, laybys and slip road at Ojodu Berger; delivered the Jubilee Bridge and adjourning roads at Abule Egba; constructed Jubilee flyover at Ajah and replaced the Ajah roundabout with signalized intersection and also rehabilitated Freedom Road and Admiralty Road in Lekki; completed 21 Lagos-Ogun boundary roads with two bridges; constructed Aradagun-Iworo-Ajido Bridge in Badagry; rehabilitated and upgraded arterial roads in Epe and Omotayo Banwo/Kola Iyaomolere Road, as well as Alapere Road and Junction Improvement Works in Ketu, five new pedestrian bridges, among others.
