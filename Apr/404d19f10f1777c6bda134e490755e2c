The Governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir el-Rufa’i has felicitated with Christians on the occasion of Easter. The governor in an Easter message urged that as people of faith, they should practice sacrifice, care for the poor, have deep spiritual reflection and love for all human kind, irrespective of tribe or religion. He said, for more than two thousand years, Easter has symbolised the triumph of hope over despair and an affirmation that darkness cannot outdo the plans and wishes of Almighty God. The governor said Jesus Christ set an example of sacrifice that has moved men and women through the ages and urged Nigerians to embrace all the lessons of Easter, never losing faith in the will of Almighty God, and the triumph of good over evil. “Let us uphold each other in our common humanity and pray for peace in our land. Let us do our best to promote harmony in our communities and reject strife in our land. Let hope never depart from our hearts,” he said. El-Rufa’i called on all citizens to join hands with him to make Kaduna State peaceful and safe for all.
