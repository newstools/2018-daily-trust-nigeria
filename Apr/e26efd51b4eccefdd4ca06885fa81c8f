Thousands of anti-government protesters have rallied defiantly in the Armenian capital Yerevan after riot police seized their leader. Nikol Pashinyan was arrested after televised talks with Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan collapsed. In a tense exchange, the opposition MP insisted the PM should quit and Mr Sargsyan accused him of “blackmail”. The opposition object to Mr Sargsyan clinging to power after serving two consecutive terms as president. He was elected to the post by parliament on Tuesday, fuelling anger on the streets. As well as Mr Pashinyan, two other opposition politicians and some 200 demonstrators have been held, leaving the protest movement without political leadership.
