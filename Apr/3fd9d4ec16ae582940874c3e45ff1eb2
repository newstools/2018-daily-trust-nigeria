Israel has freed 207 African migrants from prison after it missed a deadline to deport them, AFP news agency reports. The government is still negotiating with a third country, believed to be Uganda, to take in the migrants who come from Eritrea and Sudan. Uganda said on Friday that it would accept 500 of the migrants. Israel’s supreme court had given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government until Sunday to finalise a deal it was working on to deport some of the migrants.
