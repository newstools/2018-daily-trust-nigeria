The Lagos police command have arrested two armed robbery suspects for allegedly stealing a commercial bus from where it was parked at Jakande Estate, Ajah on March 29, 2018. The suspects, identified as Wasiu Lateef, 26, and Abdullahi Adisa, 23, were arrested at their hideout in Mushin. The Lagos State Police Commissioner, Imohimi Edgal, said the arrest followed a report made at the Ajah police station by one Nwaeze Obinna alleging that his Volkswagen Caravelle bus registration number KJA 815 AV, had been stolen from where it was parked. Investigation by policemen from the Federal Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) led to the arrest of Lateef and Adisa, who led the police to Mushin where the bus was recovered, along with one master key, according to Edgal.
