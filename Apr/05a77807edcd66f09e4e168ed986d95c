Libyan coastguards recovered the bodies of 11 migrants who died during an attempted crossing to Italy off Libyaâ€™s western coast on Sunday, a spokesman said. More than 80 migrants survived the incident off the western city of Sabratha and coastguards brought them back to Zawiya, about 25 km (16 miles) to the east, said naval coastguard spokesman Ayoub Qassem. The migrants were from various sub-Saharan African countries, he said. Libya is the most common departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by sea. More than 600,000 crossed the central Mediterranean to Italy in the past four years, the vast majority from Libya.
