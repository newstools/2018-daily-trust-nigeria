The Tiv Area Traditional Council (TATC) on Friday condemned the killing of two Catholic priests and 17 parishioners at Ignatius Catholic Church, Ukpo-Mbalom in Gwer West Local Government Area of the state, describing the act, as inhuman and satanic. In a communique issued at the end of an emergency meeting of the TATC held at the Tor Tiv Palace in Gboko, the council stated that, "this evil act ought to be condemned by all sane minds as Benue is becoming a theatre of bloodshed orchestrated by the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore." The communique signed jointly by the Tor Kwande, Chief Ambrose Oyorter and TATC Secretary, Shinyi Tyodzua, also condemned the military invasion of Naka town following an alleged killing of a military personnel which resulted in the loss of lives and destruction of property. The council added that the incessant genocidal killings of Tiv people in Nasarawa and Taraba States was not acceptable. They however appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to put in place necessary machinery to stop further killings of Tiv people in the Benue Valley and beyond.
