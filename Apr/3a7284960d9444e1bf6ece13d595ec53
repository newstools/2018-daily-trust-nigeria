Two suspected suicide bombers who tried to infiltrate the University of Maiduguri (UniMaid) were gunned down by security operatives safeguarding the institution. The police spokesman in Borno State, DSP Edet Okon, confirmed the incident in a statement he issued yesterday, saying that the two - male and female bombers -were the only casualties. He said some policemen and a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) soldier foiled the suicide bomb attack, and that two religious activities held in the state were hitch-free. Also confirming the incident, the Spokesman of the Nigeria Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Olatokumbo Adesanya, said in a statement he also issued yesterday that the suicide bomb attack was aborted by special forces of the Air Force and the Nigerian Army Sunday night. “The Boko Haram terrorist suicide bombers tried to gain access into the university but were quickly detected by the NAF Special Forces… There was no reported fatality except for the suicide bomber, whose counterparts immediately fled when the NAF Special Forces and the NA troops opened fire on them. The NAF Agusta Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) then went in pursuit of the fleeing BHTs, following which an additional suicide bomber was identified and neutralized. The NAF Agusta LUH was still searching for the other fleeing BHTs as at the time of this statement,” Adesanya stated.
