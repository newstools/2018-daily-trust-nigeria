Senators yesterday expressed reservations over the refusal of the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris to honour Senate invitation on the arrest of Senator Dino Melaye (APC, Kogi) and killings across the country. Idris was to appear before the Senate during plenary yesterday; rather he followed President Muhammadu Buhari to Bauchi State and sent a Deputy Inspector General (Operations), Habila Joshak to represent him. Senators rejected Joshak and fixed next week Wednesday for the appearance of the IG. The Senate deputy leader, Senator Bala Ibn Na’Allah said the IG was with President Buhari in Bauchi. “By the Votes and Proceedings, it is the IGP and I think it won’t be right for us to go against it.  The invitation for the IG is by the 180 million Nigerians through their representatives. The way I see the institution of democracy is being treated, I’m not comfortable,” he said. Senate President Bukola Saraki said the dignity and integrity of democratic institutions must be protected. He said the sending of the DIG by the IG was not respectful enough, saying “those who were appointed by the President are creating more problems for him.”
