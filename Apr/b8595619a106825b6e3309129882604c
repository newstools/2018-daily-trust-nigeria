The Presidency has confirmed that Nigerians in the United Kingdom yesterday protested against President Muhammadu Buhari on his arrival in London. A presidential aide, who confirmed this to State House reporters yesterday, noted that the protest was staged barely 24 hours after President Buhari declared his intention to seek re-election in 2019. He alleged that ‘corrupt elements’ within and outside Nigeria had been jolted to push “panic buttons, including renting a motley crowd of professional demonstrators to protest against the president on his arrival in the United Kingdom.” He quoted security sources as revealing that the protesters were bent on embarrassing and humiliating Buhari throughout his stay in the UK. According to him, the protesters have vowed to take their demonstrations to the venue of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting holding later in the month in Britain, which Buhari is attending. “Esteemed Nigerians home and abroad, friends and business investors in Nigeria, should please see through the veil of the motive behind the Abuja House, Kensington London demonstration. It was an orchestrated act of desperation and a ploy to blackmail and hoodwink the President from concentrating on his anti corruption campaign, which is fast gaining grounds locally and internationally,” our source stated authoritatively. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, said Buhari would not be distracted from his mission in London.
