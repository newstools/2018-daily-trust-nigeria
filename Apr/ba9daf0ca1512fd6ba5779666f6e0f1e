The Federal Government will set up a technical committee to find out the causes of loss of water at the Goronyo Dam. Daily Trust reported that the 40-year old dam was said to be the second largest dam in Nigeria after Tiga Dam in Kano. The dam is drying up due to the shortage of water, a situation that had caused a serious water shortage in Sokoto and environs. Inspecting the dam, the Minister of Water Resources, Alhaji Sulaiman Kazaure, said, “I was here two years ago and the difference in terms of water concentration is just too much. We need to take this very seriously.”
