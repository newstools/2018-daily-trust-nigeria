The Kogi State Police Command on Monday confirmed that the two principal suspects in the gun-running allegations levelled against Senator Dino Melaye and four others who escaped from their custody in Lokoja have been rearrested. 

Spokesman of the Kogi Police Command, Williams Aya, who confirmed this to our correspondent, said all the rearrested suspects have since been moved to the Police Force Headquarters, Abuja. 

Recall that the duo of Kabiru Seidu, aka Osama and Nuhu Salisu, aka Small, who were the principal suspects that accused Melaye of arming them with weapons escaped from the 'A' Police Division in Lokoja last Wednesday in a dramatic manner. 

The four other suspects that escaped from detention alongside the duo include Aliyu Isa, Adams Suleiman, Emmanuel Audu and Musa Mohammed. 

Aya told Daily Trust that the suspects were rearrested from various locations in the state following the concerted efforts of the IGP's intelligence response team working in collaboration with men of the state police command.
