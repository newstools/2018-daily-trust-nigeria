President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday congratulated Julius Maada Bio on his victory as the new President of Sierra Leone after the presidential election run-off on March 31. Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman Mr Femi Adesina, commended the people of Sierra Leone on the successful conduct of the presidential election run-off as well as the parliamentary and local council elections held on March 7, 2018. With the elections concluded and following the trend of recently held peaceful elections in West Africa, Buhari urged all stakeholders in Sierra Leone to work together for the peace, security and development of the country. The president enjoined all those with grievances over the outcome of the elections to seek constitutional means of resolving them. He stressed that nothing should be done to endanger the peace and stability of the country in particular and the sub-region in general. He saluted the resilient spirit of Sierra Leoneans, who had clearly demonstrated their ability to manage their own affairs and consolidate on the countryâ€™s progress after a post-conflict era. He also commended the immediate past president, Ernest Bai Koroma, for his commitment to a credible electoral process and spirited efforts at bringing stability and positive changes to the nation during his presidency. Buhari said he looked forward to working with President Bio for the growth, prosperity and stability of both nations, and West Africa.
