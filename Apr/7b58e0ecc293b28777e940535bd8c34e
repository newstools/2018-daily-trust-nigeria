Residents of Jos, Plateau State, have lamented poor power supply in the last few weeks, saying refrigerated items have perished due to constant outages. Residents of Filin Sukuwa, a community beside University of Jos at Bauchi Road, said they now go as long as 24 hours without power supply and called on the Jos Electricity Distribution Company to look into their plight or explain reasons for the constant power outages. Ibrahim Idris who lives in the community, told Daily Trust that in the last two weeks, the community had experienced worsening power outage with no explanation from the management of JED. “The last time we had electricity was on Sunday. We later learnt that they were making some repairs on one of their feeders but the least they could have done was to announce it to their customers so that we know and prepare for it,” he told Daily Trust yesterday. Yohanna Losam who lives in Tudun Wada told our correspondent that people in the area now live with constant power outages despite having prepaid meters. “The power disruption is just too much. Most times, if we are lucky we get five or six hours of electricity in a day and it is affecting small businesses,” he said. When contacted, the Head, Corporate Communications at JED, Dr. Friday Adakole Elijah said the company was doing its best to ration the available energy it receives to all its franchise states. “We give energy based on availability. We are entitled to five per cent because all the discos have their percentages. We share the five per cent according to availability,” Dr. Elijah explained.
