The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has called for equal representation and recognition of all indigenous tribes in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Candido, who spoke at the Gwandara Cultural Festival Day held in Jiwa yesterday, said there were more than five tribes in the FCT and that one tribe should not be recognised at the expense of others. He said, “Government should recognise all the tribes in the FCT and never again should there be consideration to a few tribes above others because we are all one and we are all living in peace.” He further said the Gwandara people were peace-loving and would continue to live in peace with all tribes in the territory, adding that the cultural day was an opportunity for the people to showcase what made their culture distinct. “What is happening right now is a showcase of what the Gwandara people represent and to let Nigerians realise that there are other cultures in the territory. Some people think that the FCT is made up of just one tribe,” he said. The FCT Chairman of the Association of Gwandara People (AGP), Alhaji Idu Imam, said the event was organised to show Nigerians the Gwandara way of life. Imam said, “I am happy about the event. This is the FCT and it belongs to everybody and as indigenes it is ideal for us to show our brothers who are not indigenes our way of life,” he said. The FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, who was represented by the Secretary, Area Council Services Secretariat (ACSS), Adamu Bappah, commended the organisers for creating an avenue to promote peace, unity and harmony in the country.
