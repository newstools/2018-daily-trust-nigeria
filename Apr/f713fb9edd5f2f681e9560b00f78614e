Embattled Senator Dino Melaye has again surrendered himself to the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) shortly after his escape from custody in a fracas around Area 1 round-about in Abuja. The Senator had surrendered himself to the Police this morning, 24th April, 2018 for investigation into criminal allegations leveled against him. He submitted himself after the Police obtained a warrant of arrest and trailed him to his house at Maitama, Abuja and cordon off the place. However, around 2 pm this afternoon Melaye escaped police custody with the help of still unknown persons, who whisked him away from police men conveying him to Kogi State. It was gathered that after the escape, Melaye again surrendered himself to a nearby police outpost. Melaye is said to have been hospitalized in Abuja, following his re-arrest due to injuries suffered in the fracas during his initial escape.
