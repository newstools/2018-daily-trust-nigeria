The Chairman of Kuje Area Council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has said that four people are still being held by kidnappers in the area. Galadima, who spoke with newsmen shortly after an emergency security meeting in his office last Thursday, assured residents, especially  relations of those in captivity that the council will do everything to ensure that they are rescued alive. According to him, some innocent people in the council were kidnapped last week along with a relative of the secretary of the Local Education Authority (LEA) of the council, Bulus Danladi, and his guard. “The education secretary’s brother and his security guard were kidnapped but we thank God they are back, while there are four people still held captive by the kidnappers,” he said. He said the spate of kidnapping in the area has become a nightmare to the entire residents. “I am assuring the people that they should have confidence in this administration and God willing, we shall ensure that these bad people are fished out to face the wrath of the law,” he said.
