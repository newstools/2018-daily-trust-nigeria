The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) has confirmed three persons dead while seven others were injured in an auto accident that occurred on the Oshodi-Apapa expressway yesterday morning. The agency said that the deceased suffered from electric shock from a neon signpost which was knocked down by a truck at the Ilasamaja bus stop on the expressway. The LASEMA General Manager, Mr Adesina Tiamiyu, who confirmed the incident, said, “Preliminary investigation carried out by the LASEMA Response Team at the scene of the incident revealed that an empty lorry truck (Iveco) with registration number MEK 695 XA hit an overhead signpost which subsequently fell on a commercial Coaster bus coming from behind. “Unfortunately, seven victims - four adult females and three male adults - suffered severe injuries. They were rescued and stabilized by the agency’s officials and LASAMBUS. They were subsequently transferred to the Mushin General Hospital for further treatment. Three adult males lost their lives and were handed over to officials of the State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit (SEHMU) for onward transfer to the mortuary.” He urged motorists to ensure they drive within the approved speed limit and also watch out for road signs and other impediments to avoid unnecessary loss of lives.
