Indonesia has declared a state of emergency to help stop a deadly oil spill spreading off the coast of the island of Borneo. At least four fishermen in the port city of Balikpapan were killed over the weekend when the fuel ignited. Hundreds of people have reported health issues since Saturday’s spill. It is not clear what caused the oil spill. As it continues to spread, the risk of further fires is increasing, the authorities said on Tuesday. The Balikpapan environmental agency has warned members of the local community to avoid any activities “that could spark fires”
