The Wharf road bridge that leads into the nation's oldest seaports, the Apapa Port, will soon be shutdown permanently to make way for the ongoing construction. The Federal Controller of Works, Lagos, Mr. Adedamola Kuti who disclosed this also revealed that stakeholders are currently searching for alternative routes for vehicles going into Apapa. Kuti revealed that once alternative routes have been identified by stakeholders, the Apapa Bridge will be closed to make way for permanent repairs to commence. The bridge is the major link to the port from Ijora through the Wharf Road. He said Julius Berger Plc., the contractor handling the project, is ready to move to site to begin work.
