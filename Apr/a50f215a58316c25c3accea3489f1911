Internally Displaced Women of Daffo District in Bokkos Local Government Area (LGA) of Plateau State who were affected by the recent escalation of clashes between their communities and the Fulani have staged a peaceful protest in Jos, the Plateau State capital. The women numbering over a hundred were all dressed in black. They marched from the Plateau State House of Assembly to the Government House as well as other parts of the state capital. The protesters addressed a petition letter to the state government and presented a copy to the state assembly through the Speaker, saying that the painful plights of over 7,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Daffo, Bokkos LGA called for urgent action. Signed by their representative, Mrs. Matawal Comfort Malan, the letter said the poor health condition, hunger and depression at the IDPS camps was already breeding suicidal tendencies among the adolescents. “It is no longer news that Daffo District in Bokkos LGA of Plateau State was recently hit by violent attacks by persons believed to be Fulani herdsmen that have been resident in the host communities for years. This has led to 32 deaths, 10 severe injuries, 10 missing persons and displacement of over 7,000 from nine villages. It is imperative to call attention … to the prevailing humanitarian situation facing us the victims of the attacks. We are faced with the most threatening state of healthcare, destitution, poverty and hunger,” she said. In his remark when the women stormed the state House of Assembly complex, the Speaker, Peter Azi, said the government had been trying its best to ensure that the security issue was resolved.
