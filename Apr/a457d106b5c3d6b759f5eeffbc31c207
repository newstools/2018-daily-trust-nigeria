Two persons lost their lives, while four others sustained injuries in multiple accidents which occurred yesterday morning at Kwaita bridge, along Abuja- Lokoja road. A Volkswagen Golf vehicle and two trucks were involved in one of the accidents. The driver of the Golf was burnt to death after the vehicle went up in flames when he rammed into the trucks. A witness said one of the trucks had registration number XB 458 NSR, while the other vehicles were unmarked. He said a passenger in one of the trucks was also burnt in the accident adding that the corpses were evacuated by men of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC). He said the four injured victims were taken to Kwali General Hospital. The two trucks and the vehicle were still on fire when our reporter arrived at the accident scene while some people were seen trying to offload one of the trucks carrying fertilizer. When contacted, the Yangoji Unit Commander of the FRSC, ACC Samgbaza Joseph, confirmed the accident. He attributed it to wrongful overtaking. He said the burnt corpse of the Golf driver was deposited at Kwali General Hospital’s morgue, while one of the corpses from the truck had been handed over to relatives for burial. “The other four injured victims who are all male adults were taken to Kwali General Hospital,” he said.
