The Chief of Mutum Biyu in Taraba State, Justice Sani Suleiman Duna (Rtd), has threatened to sanction district, village and ward heads who allow criminals to reside in their domains. He also directed that all strangers who come to reside in their domains must be registered and their activities monitored. Suleiman Duna who is a second class chief, gave the directive during the annual general meeting of Mutum Biyu Development Association (MUDA), Saturday, saying the measure became necessary in view of movement of criminal elements into many parts of Taraba State, including the chiefdom which he said they use as a hideout because of its rural nature. The chief of Mutum Biyu also advised residents of towns and villages in the chiefdom to be alert and report suspicious people directly to him and to security agents. He asked parents to counsel their children and wards against drug abuse, as crimes in the society were often traced to the phenomenon among youths. Alhaji Sani Suleiman however commended parents in the chiefdom for encouraging their children and wards to attend school. He said no society would attain desired development without education. The Mutum Biyu Development Association realized N7 million at the launching of its Education and Development Endowment fund during the meeting.
