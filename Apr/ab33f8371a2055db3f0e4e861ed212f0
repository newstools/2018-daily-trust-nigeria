A 55-year-old man, Moses Ayemojuba, has been remanded in prison custody for allegedly issuing a dud cheque to the management of Nathhole Petroleum Limited. Ayemojuba was remanded  pending when he will meet his bail conditions. The accused was dragged before an Ejigbo magistrate’s court on Friday on a three-count charge of conspiracy, forgery and stealing. The police prosecutor, Assistant Superintendent of Police, Kenneth Asibor, told the court that the accused allegedly issued a forged N8 million Catholic Church bank cheque to an oil company, Nathhole Petroleum Limited. Asibor said that the transaction took place at Christ the King’s Catholic Church, Shasha, Lagos. He said that the accused, along with others at large, had sometime in March this year approached the management of the company to supply the church 30,000 litres of diesel worth about N8m. After the supply was made, the accused and his gang allegedly gave the company’s representative a cheque with serial number 000055. The cheque was later found to have been allegedly forged when it was presented for payment at the bank. Ayemojuba was thereafter arrested after the case was reported at the station. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty. Consequently, the presiding magistrate, Mr T.O. Shomade, granted him bail in the sum of N9m with two sureties in like sum. The matter was adjourned till May 9, 2018.
