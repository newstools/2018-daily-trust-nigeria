Sudan President Omar al-Bashir has ordered the immediate release of all political prisoners in the country. State media said the decision had been made in response to calls by political parties and others involved in an ongoing national dialogue. It said freeing the prisoners would allow all political groups to take part in discussions about how to solve Sudanâ€™s problems. Many people have been arrested in recent months during protests against the rising cost of living. There are also many other political detainees.
