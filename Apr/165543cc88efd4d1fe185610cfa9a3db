A Mararaba Upper Area Court, Nasarawa State, has sentenced a 28-year-old man, Ikechukwu Mbana, to one year’s imprisonment for stealing a passenger’s bag containing a laptop worth N250,000. The convict, who resides in Abia, had pleaded guilty to one-count charge of theft, and begged for leniency. The judge, Ibrahim Shekarau, did not give the convict an option of fine. The prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Ejeh, had earlier told the court that Ambassador Oghenakeno of Victoria Island, Lagos, reported the matter at the Abacha Road Police Station, Mararaba, on April 14. He said Mbana stole Oghenakeno’s laptop on the fateful date. According to the prosecutor, the complainant went to Peace Mass Transit Park, Mararaba, Nasarawa State to book for a journey, “so, he kept his bag containing one laptop T3 Lenovo valued at N250,000 on the seat of the vehicle and went to buy something. “Before he returned, Mbana had stolen the bag, but was pursued and caught by people around.” The offence, the prosecutor said, contravened Section 288 of the penal code.
