 The president of the United Church of Christ in Nations (UCCN) also known as HEKAN church, Reverend Amos G. Kiri has called on the Federal Government of Nigeria to find a lasting solution to the insecurity ravaging the country so that the safety of lives and properties of citizens can be guaranteed. Speaking at the 52nd HEKAN national convention which held in Kaduna,  Reverend Kiri he urged government at both federal and states level to improve on security apparatus in the country. "For years now, killings of innocent souls have being the order of the day. Herdsmen/farmers clashes have claimed too many lives. Nigeria has become a fearful place to live because you could be kidnapped, attacked in the farm or even in your house by hoodlums/bandits," he lamente. While he urged that the recent allegation of compromise by some bad elements among our security forces and subsequent admittance by the Federal Government as reported by the media be investigated; he advised that the culprits be punished according to the laws of the land. “This is the only way the spate of killings can be nibbed so that we can all exercise our freedom to live or move anywhere we wish within the country,” he said. Commenting on the kidnap of Chibok and Dapchi school girls, he commended the efforts of the Federal government in the release of some of the kidnapped Chibok girls as well as the Dapchi girls; noting that the only Dapchi girl still in captivity due to her refusal to renounce her faith may have compromised the good efforts of the Government.
