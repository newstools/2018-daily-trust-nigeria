Suspected armed bandits have killed at least 27 people in attacks on Kabaro and Danmani villages in Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Daily Trust gathered. Last week, 26 people were killed in similar attacks on Kuru-Kuru and Jarkuka villages in Anka Local Government Area. The attack on Kabaro, a village located 24 kilometres west of Dansadau town came six years after at least 18 people were shot by bandits and cattle rustlers in the same community in October 2012. The troubled Dansadau district is one of the areas hit hard by the activities of armed bandits and cattle rustlers. The notorious cattle rustling kingpin called Buharin Daji was killed in a forest near Dansadau town. Residents told Daily Trust that the gunmen had earlier intercepted two men on a motor bike on their way to the village from Dansadau town and shot them. Angered by the development, residents mobilized and caught one of the bandits, and publicly executed him. Upon learning about the development, the gunmen returned, laid siege on the community and started shooting at residents after they had blocked likely escape routes. They killed 23 people in Kabaro and four in Dammani. Zamfaraâ€™s police spokesman, DSP Muhammad Shehu, confirmed the attack.
