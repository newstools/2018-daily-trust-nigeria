A presidential aspirant, Senator Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, yesterday, said he will defeat President Muhammadu Buhari in next year’s presidential election. The former lawmaker, who declared his intention to vie for the presidency last week, said he possessed all that was required to defeat President Buhari in the next election. “President Muhammadu Buhari is welcome to contest for the presidency in 2019, and I think it is a healthy practice to have a gentleman of his age, his mould and people who have been in power for the past 50 years to contest. But as for popularity, it is highly arguable. “Absolutely, he will not have it easy. Do not forget that President Buhari had contested three elections and lost until a certain action by the PDP made many members to exit the party and go to APC, and made him to win,” he said.
