The direct beneficiaries of the recent abolition of the disparity between university and polytechnic graduates in the civil service have commended President Muhammadu Buhari, for his actions that ended the Bsc/HND dichotomy era. While the dichotomy had hitherto restricted polytechnic graduates to particularly Salary Grade Level (SGL) in the civil service, it took the intervention of the National Council on Establishment (NCE) to resolve the matter in their favour. The Head of Service of the Federation (HOCSF), Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita, in circular dated March 26, 2018, conveyed the decision of the NCE to all concerned and solicited their support for implementation. The circular indicated that NCE approved entry point of SGL 08 for HND holders in the civil service. It also encouraged serving HND officers to fulfil all specified conditions as contained in scheme of service and extant rules for career progression beyond SGL 14. The President of the umbrella body of the beneficiaries, the Nigerian Association of Technologists in Engineering (NATE), Ahmad Yabagi, told newsmen yesterday in Abuja, that the decision has opened a great career door. “We are glad that this monster called dichotomy that has been a big threat to the development of technology in Nigeria has been defeated. NATE has therefore resolved to support and partner with the Federal Government in the quest to bequeath entrepreneurial skills to Nigerian youths as a means to turn around the economic fortune of Nigeria,” he said. He however urged government to strengthen its monitoring system to ensure that the circular by the head of service of the federation was fully implemented by all government agencies.
