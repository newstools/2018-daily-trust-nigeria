 President Muhammadu Buhari has reassured Nigerians that the nation's unity will remain his paramount objective and that of his administration. Presidential spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, quoted Buhari as saying this at the Presidential Villa in Abuja on Friday while receiving a delegation of the Tijjaniya Movement led by Sheikh Muhammadu Mahi Ibrahim Inyass. President Buhari said: ‘‘I will continue to do everything within my powers to unite Nigeria.’’ He commended the religious group for the peaceful conduct of their annual convention and urged them to bring the same to bear in promoting peace, unity and inter-religious harmony in Nigeria. Buhari also lauded the group for complementing government efforts in bringing social, economic development, and stability in Nigeria by encouraging discipline, unity and spirituality among its members. He reiterated the remarks he made on Thursday at the palace of Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu, after he was presented with the Holy Quran, that the gift of Holy Quran is the highest anyone can receive and a reminder to seek and uphold justice in the service of the nation. The leader of the group, Sheikh Muhammadu Mahi Ibrahim Inyass, told Buhari that members of the group would continue to support and appreciate his ‘‘noble agenda for the benefit of all Nigerians,’’  because they believe elected officials must be ‘‘accountable, incorruptible and God-fearing.’’ ‘‘It has never been easy. Even our Holy Prophet (SWA) was never totally accepted in his lifetime. It was only after he had long gone, people saw the wisdom in his preaching and sacrifices. We, therefore, urge you not to relent in your efforts. ‘‘Therefore, it is pertinent for you to note, Your Excellency, that majority of us are with your government and would ensure a total support for you in your effort to return Nigeria to the path of greater progress and development,’’ Sheikh Inyass said.
