The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) has announced the introduction of a new legal provision against terrorism in the country. The AGF said the new law: Terrorism Prohibition and Prevention Bill will replace the current Terrorism Prevention Act, 2011 (amended in 2013). Speaking at the opening of the Regional Workshop on ‘Prison Intelligence in a Counterterrorism Context’ in Abuja yesterday, Malami said when passed by the National Assembly, the new law would enhance coordination amongst relevant law enforcement, intelligence, prisons and security agencies in the country. Malami, who was represented by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Mohammed Etsu, said the law has also expanded the definition of terrorism financing and the sanctions applicable to terrorists and those who fund them. While commending the International Institute of Justice and Rule of Law (IIJ) of Malta and the governments of USA, Germany, UK, Switzerland, EU and other development partners for their cooperation, Malami said the ministry has initiated reforms for decongestion in prisons, and the de-radicalisation and rehabilitation of terrorism suspects through the office of the National Security Adviser.
