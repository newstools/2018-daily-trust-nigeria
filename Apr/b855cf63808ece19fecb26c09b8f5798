Natives of the FCT under the aegis of Coalition of Abuja Indigenous Associations (CAIA) have petitioned the management of the University of Abuja for allegedly denying them admission into the institution. They also accused the management of denying them employment. The petition, jointly signed by the association’s coordinator and secretary general, Alhaji Adamu Kamal Shuaibu and Barrister Christopher Dada, was copied to the Inspector General of Police,  FCT director of DSS,  FCT police commissioner and the National Universities Commission (NUC). They alleged that the university’s management had continuously and deliberately schemed out the natives of the FCT from getting admission. They said the university had also denied the natives employment opportunities, despite the fact that the land the university is sited belongs to them. “Despite the natives’ contribution as well as our  collective resolve to permit peaceful and smooth running of the institution situated on our ancestral land without any compensation, we have been denied admission and employment. “But we shall massively occupy the university community in the coming days to ensure that our candidates who chose University of Abuja and have the requisite qualifications and also have the required cut off mark of JAMB be admitted into the institution,” they said.
