Hoodlums have allegedly killed 10 travellers in Yelwata, a border town between Benue and Nasarawa States along Lafia-Makurdi highway. The North-Central Zonal Chairman of Myetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Alhaji Danladi Chiroma, told our correspondent that the victims were herders from Awe in Nasarawa State who were travelling on Saturday evening to attend a naming ceremony in another location. Chiroma said that the vehicle which the deceased travelled in developed a problem at Yelwata and that it was in the process of the driver trying to fix the fault that the hoodlums pounced on them. He added that six corpses out of the 10 people killed had been recovered and handed to the police while the driver of the vehicle, a Hausa man was lucky to have escaped the danger. The Police in Benue State had not responded to calls and text messages sent to their mobile telephone lines at the time of sending this report. But the state governor, Samuel Ortom, condemned the attacks on the innocent passengers by hoodlums near Yelwata,. Ortom in a press statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, also commended the police for swiftly arresting some of the suspects for prosecution. The governor urged the police and other security agencies to continue with the investigation to apprehend all those found culpable, stressing that Benue was not at war and appealed to the people to restrain themselves from all forms of lawless acts. Another version of the story told by the Nasarawa State Chairman of MACBAN, Muhammed Hussaini, had it that the culprits were Tiv youths and that the deceased included women and children.
