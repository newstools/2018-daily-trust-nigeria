The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called for investigation into the violent clash between the Police and members of the Shiite Movement yesterday in Abuja. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan blamed the All Progressives Congress (APC) led government over what it termed use of force and infringement on the rights of citizens. “The PDP is gravely worried over the handling of security in the nation’s capital and the near breakdown of law and order, which resulted in stampede and disruption of public and private businesses in the city centre. “The PDP has noted that the development is linked with protests over the continued refusal of the APC-led federal government to release the leader of the group, Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky, despite being granted bail by courts of competent jurisdiction. “Furthermore, the PDP and indeed, all lovers of democracy across the country are deeply concerned about the continued erosion of democratic tenets by the APC administration, resulting in avoidable crisis in various parts of the country,” the party said. PDP called for calm and urged security high commands to ensure that the matter was nipped in the bud applying the highest level of professionalism.
