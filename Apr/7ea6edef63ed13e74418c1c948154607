Wife of the President, Hajiya Aisha Buhari has promised to ensure the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV in the country. Mrs Buhari who is the new UNAIDS Special Ambassador for the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV said she would use her voice to ensure that no child was born with HIV in Nigeria by 2020. A joint statement from UNAIDS and the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) yesterday quoted her as saying it was with  great sense of responsibility that she accepted to serve as UNAIDS Special Ambassador. Nigeria has one of the highest rates of new HIV infections among children in the world. In 2016, an estimated 37 000 children were infected with HIV and 24, 000 children died of AIDS-related illnesses. About 270, 000 children were living with HIV in 2016, and only 32% of pregnant women living with HIV had access to antiretroviral medicines to prevent transmitting the virus to their children. Michel Sidibé, the Executive Director of UNAIDS said the trust and respect that Mrs Buhari commanded in the country would  help quicken the pace of stopping new HIV infections among children, as well as ensure treatment for all children living with the disease. Pauline Tallen, the Board Chairperson of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) said the goal of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Nigeria was a laudable one, adding that it must be achieved. She said those working in the HIV sector were delighted that Mrs Buhari had accepted the important role of UNAIDS Special Ambassador.
