Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike,  called on labour leaders across Nigeria to raise their  voices in defence of democracy. Governor Wike said Nigerian Labour leaders can no longer stand aloof while the fabric of governance is being destroyed. He said: “As patriots and concerned Nigerians, we must all break our silence and protest against the atrocious and brutal system of the federal government that daily undermines our right to democracy, the rule of law and good governance. “Nigerians want you and I to stand up and raise our voices for unity, for security, for justice, for the rule of law, for democracy and for free and fair elections in 2019.”. The former president of the union, Comrade Igwe Achese, decried the casualization of workers in the oil and gas industry, noting that steps must be taken  to address the issue. In a goodwill message, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, represented by the member representing Obio/Akpor federal constituency, Kingsley Chinda, assured that the House will consider a bill to end casualization in the oil and gas industry.
