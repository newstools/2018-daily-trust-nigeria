Gunmen on Tuesday allegedly killed a village head, Iyongovihi Ninge, in Chembe settlement of Ukemberagya/Tswarev ward in Gaambe-Tiev district of Logo Local Government Area in Benue State. Witnesses said that the deceased monarch had gone to his farm to inspect workers who were tilling the ground in preparation for this season's planting of yam when the gunmen believed to be suspected herders showed up and shot him from the back. The locals alleged that the traditional head died on the spot while those working in his farm fled for safety as the suspected herders with a large herd took over the vicinity. Chairman of Logo council, Richard Nyajo, said he had received report that the Chembe village head was killed in an attack Tuesday afternoon by suspected herders who also pursued the people of the community from their farms and homes with their sporadic gun shots. Meanwhile, the State Police Commissioner,Â  Fatai Owoseni, said he was yet to receive reports of the attack at the time of filing this story.
