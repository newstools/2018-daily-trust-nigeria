Twenty eight fire officers, including the Director of the Lagos State Fire Service,  Mr Rasak Fadipe yesterday retired from active service after serving for 35 years. Speaking during the pulling out ceremony at the headquarters of the state fire service in Alausa, the Commissioner for Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Relations, Mr. Oluseye Oladejo promised to purchase more modern equipment as well as improve the capacity of the state’s firemen. While congratulating the 28 firemen on their retirement, Oladejo urged the next director, which according to him will be appointed soon, to take a cue from Fadipe’s numerous achievements during his service as the head of fire service in the state. Recalling the efforts of the firemen during his 35 years of service, Fadipe applauded his men for their effective and efficient response to the Dana Airplane disaster of June 3, 2012 where many people were prevented from being consumed by fire and the recent Olusosun fire incident which took several days to combat. Fadipe, who was the first substantive director of the state fire service, enjoined his successor to ensure the fire fighters receive international training; a feat which he said could not be achieved by him. He joined the fire service on April 5, 1983 as a recruit, became the acting deputy head of fire service in 2008, acting director in 2012  and later the substantive director later that year.
