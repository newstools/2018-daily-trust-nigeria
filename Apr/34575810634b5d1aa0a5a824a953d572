The League Management Company (LMC) and the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) have extended the community engagement program, ‘VAT Wonder Goal’,  launched last season on the platform of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) as part of the national tax education exercise. The LMC had introduced the Wonder Goal midseason of the 2015/16 season to build affinity between players, their clubs and their community of domicile. It is aimed amongst other objectives to create an engagement channel between the clubs and their immediate communities through charity work by players who win the award. The initiative won the support of the FIRS last season and ran from Match Day 20 to the end of the season with players from different clubs emerging winners and nominating charity organizations that received cash donations. “This is to convey the approval of the League Management Company (LMC) for the extension of the partnership with Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) for the amplification of the national Tax Education campaign on the platform of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL)”, Shehu Dikko, the LMC Chairman wrote in a letter to FIRS confirming the league’s satisfaction with the partnership. The partnership offers the NPFL as a platform for FIRS to engage the football community on the benefits of paying taxes and other government charges such as the Value Added Tax (VAT). Messages encouraging citizens to know and discharge their tax obligations would be displayed at match venues and FIRS officials could distribute fliers to fans during matches. Video of goals scored during a specific match day will be uploaded on the NPFL website, www.npfl.ng, facebook, twitter and youtube accounts for fans to vote the most exciting and intelligently executed goal. The player whose goal attracts the highest number of votes wins the award and will be presented monetary reward, 50% of which is to be invested in a Charity of the player’s choice within the city the club is located. Dikko also announced that the prize money remains N150,000 out of which the player will invest N75,000 on the selected Charity
