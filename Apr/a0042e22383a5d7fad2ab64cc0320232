The Presidency says merchants of mischief have taken their antics against the first family further by creating a fake Facebook account in the name of Zahra, President Muhammadu Buhari’s daughter. Presidential spokesman Mr Femi Adesina, in a statement Friday said the fake account, conspicuously different from the authentic one, was used to post a message on April 17, 2018 at 9:07am. He said a picture of President Buhari with snowflakes all over him and being welcomed to a foreign country was used alongside a message. The said message read: “Children of God, here is a 75 years old man walking in the snow without cardigan just to rescue the battered economic status of Nigeria and some of you senseless people feel he travels too much, as if he travels for partying or merry-making. God bless Nigeria. Please share.” According to Adesina, the Presidency repudiates the Facebook account as it does not belong to Zahra. He urged members of the public to be wary.
