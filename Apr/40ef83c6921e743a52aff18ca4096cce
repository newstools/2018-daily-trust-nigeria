"For avoidance of doubt  and to put the record straight, the Nigerian Army wishes to state that every eligible Nigerians are qualified to  be recruited into the Nigerian Army providing such individual meet the set down standard meant for the recruitment".  "All the candidates for the recruitment exercise  from Demsa, Numan, Lamurde and  Girei Local Government Areas are currently participating in  the ongoing recruitment exercise like any other candidates".  ‎" The Nigerian Army wish to advised all well meaning citizens to disregard such an unfounded allegation which is an imagination of the writer".  "The allegation that the Nigerian Army selected a particular ethnic group from the South Eastern part of the country is completely false and has no bases. It is important to note that the Nigerian Army does not support any religion or tribe".  "The Army operates as an entity no matter your tribe or religion. Therefore, there is no iota of truth in the said allegation".  "The  Nigerian Army once again stated its total commitment in protecting the sovereignty of the nation as well as   carrying out its constitutional roles according to the constitution".
