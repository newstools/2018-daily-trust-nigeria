Youths have been urged to be agents of positive change in the society. Barrister Wasiu Fassasi made the call while delivering a lecture, titled, ‘Youth as Agents of Change in Modern Society: The Islamic Perspective’, during the fourth pre-Ramadan lecture organised by Ansar-Ud-Deen Youth Association of Nigeria (ADYAN) in Kubwa on Saturday. The Islamic scholar said the vices in the society can only be changed by the youths. “Our society is filled with many vices. Our hopes that will bring positive change to the society are the youths,” he said. “If you look at the Islamic perspective, Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) came to this world when the world had lost its bearing, before his coming people did not believe in one God. “They believed in goddesses. There were injustices in the Arabian Peninsula in general.  So Allah sent the prophet as comforter to the world, which he did,” he said. The group’s branch secretary, Abdul Rasheed Shuaib, said as the fasting period approaches, the group decided to sensitise people about the importance of fasting “particularly how the youths will be able to change the society by fasting.” He said the youth should be focused on how the fasting will be able to shape them, their communities and the nation at large by imbibing the fear of God and eschewing social vices. The group also presented awards to some people including Hammed Adio and the Chief Imam of ADS, Kubwa branch, Tajudeen Onireke Zubair.
