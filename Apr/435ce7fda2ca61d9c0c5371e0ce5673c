Members of the Plateau Club 1921 have reelected all the former executives to run the affairs of the club for the next two years. The re-election took place during the clubâ€™s Annual General Meeting (AGM) which took place amid internal wrangling among the members, as some of them had been aggrieved over the way the affairs of the club was being run by the leaders who were yet returned unopposed. At the AGM, several armed policemen were stationed in every corner of the club, following speculation that the aggrieved members would try to prohibit the return of the former officers. But the endorsement of the former officers still went on without any hitch. Speaking with newsmen after the AGM, the President of the club, Festus Fuanter, said he would resolve the rift with the aggrieved members. Fuanter who is also the Plateau State Commissioner for Lands and Survey, said the club was apolitical, and that it was meant for special relaxation for members who would always get together to cross-fertilize ideas.
