Armed groups in South Sudan have released 207 child soldiers, a statement from UN children’s agency Unicef says. The 112 boys and 95 girls were from serving in the ranks of the South Sudan National Liberation Movement (SSNLM) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO). SSNLM in 2016 signed a peace agreement with the government and is now integrating its fighters into the national army. The release is part of an ongoing programme that saw 300 children set free in February.
