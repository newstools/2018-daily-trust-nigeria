Bombings at voter registration centres in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and in Baghlan province have killed at least 63 people and wounded more than a hundred others, health officials said. At least 57 people were killed in Kabul when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at the doorway of an ID distribution centre in the city on Sunday, officials said. Six more people were killed later in the day in Baghlan’s Pul-e-Khumri city, when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb near another voting centre. All six were from the same family. The ISIS group said it carried out the Kabul attack, but no group has claimed responsibility for the Baghlan blast yet. The Kabul bombing occurred in the Dasht-e-Barchi area, where many of the country’s Shia Hazara minority reside. Among the victims were many women and children, witnesses said.
