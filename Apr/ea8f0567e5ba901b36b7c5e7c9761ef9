Brazilian association of criminal lawyers requested on Monday that a Supreme Court justice issue an injunction that would free former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who began serving a 12-year sentence for bribery at the weekend. The request was filed to Justice Marco Aurelio Mello and asked that he free anyone who is in jail, but has not yet had their case heard by Brazil’s top appeals court, which is the situation with Lula. If Mello accepts the request, Lula would be freed, though his decision would be temporary and have to be taken up by the full Supreme Court. Mello’s office declined to comment. Any possible action by the top court is the quickest manner in which the former president could be freed. Lula was found guilty in August of accepting bribes worth 3.7m reais ($1m) from engineering firm OAS.
