The two chambers of the National Assembly will today hold valedictory sessions for two lawmakers that passed away during the Easter break. Senator Mustapha Bukar (APC, Katsina) and Buba Jibril (APC, Kogi) died on April 4 and March 30 respectively. While Bukar was buried in Daura, Jibril was buried in Lokoja. Upon resumption of plenary yesterday, both chambers adjourned sitting in honour of the deceased lawmakers as part of their tradition. Senate Leader, Ahmad Lawan (APC, Yobe) moved for the adjourned to allow the Senate observe a valedictory session for the two lawmakers today. A similar scenario played out in the House of Representatives where Speaker Yakubu Dogara announced that the valedictory session would hold today.
