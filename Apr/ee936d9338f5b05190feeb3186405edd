The Federal Government has said that it will not be intimidated nor pressured into preventing it from releasing more names of the alleged looters of public funds.

Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said this in a statement issued by his media assistant, Segun Adeyemi on Sunday.

Alhaji Mohammed said since the release of the first two lists of the alleged looters, there have been attempts to intimidate and blackmail the Federal Government into discontinuing of more looted name.

He said the pressure is being mounted on government over its decision to expose looters is not unexpected stressing that FG knows where the pressure is coming from.

"Hack writers have inundated the social and traditional media with articles casting aspersion on the lists, while some newspapers have even resorted to writing editorials against FG over the release of the lists. Most of the write-ups have accused the government of politicising the anti-graft war by releasing the lists. We strongly disagree with them" he said.

"We do not have the power to convict anyone. That is the exclusive preserve of the courts, but we have the power to let Nigerians know those who turned the public treasury into their personal piggy banks, on the basis of concrete evidence, and that is what we are doing" he said.

Alhaji Mohammed who also noted that government has always known that corruption will fight back, "fast and furious", added that it is not surprised at the hiring of hack writers to attack the very idea of naming and shaming the looters, or the hysterical threats of litigation.

He said the fuss about politicising the anti corruption fight is to prevent government from releasing more named adding that " 1000 negative write-ups or editorials will not deter us from releasing the third and subsequent lists".

Alhaji Mohammed therefore challenges those who feel they have been wrongly accused to seek redress in court rather than "engaging in exhibitionist sophistry".
