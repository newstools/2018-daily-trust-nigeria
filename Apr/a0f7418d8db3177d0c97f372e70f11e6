People of neighboring Offa and Erin Ile communities in the Offa and Oyun local government areas of Kwara state, respectively, have resolved to end age long communal crisis and forge ahead for mutual benefit, development and growth.   The two communities, who are from Ibolo section of Yoruba tribe, were brought together by a youth organization committed to peace and development of the area.  It is recalled that the two communities had been involved in age long communal clashes, particularly on three occasions, where many lives and property were lost.  Speaking during the parley in Ilorin on Friday, chairman, main organizing committee, Ladorb peace initiative, Umar Balogun, said that conflict had discouraged the people from realizing potentials towards economic prosperity.  "In recent history, one cannot mention Offa and Erin Ile without acknowledging the conflict between both communities. It's unfortunate that the two communities had suffered losses in such a war that had no economic value, but displaced many lives", he said.
