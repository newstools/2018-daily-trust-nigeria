Some 5,000 Nigerians are expected at the National Christian Center in Abuja to celebrate the State of Israel at 70 come June 3, 2018. The Executive Secretary of the Christian United For Israel (CUFI) Prayer Outreach Nigeria, Reverend Sampson Ozovehe, said at a stakeholders’ forum at the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Secretariat in Kaduna that by the Jewish calendar, the celebration was on April 11, but by the United Nations calendar, Israel will turn 70 years on May 14, 2018. “Israel as a nation is a blessing to the entire world. It has contributed to the development of the world than other nations,” Ozovehe asserted, adding that Israel would use its 70th anniversary to release the cure for cancer to the world. “At 70, Israel wants to help the world say goodbye to cancer,” he said. Justifying the plan to make Nigerians join in marking Israel at 70, Ozovehe said Nigeria should not be quiet as other nations were celebrating Israel. “Even though Nigeria was among the countries that voted against having Jerusalem as the capital of Isreal at the UN convention, Christians across the country will on June 3, 2018 gather at the National Christians Center in Abuja to celebrate the state of Israel,” he said.
