Five people have sustained injuries in the course of a stampede after a group of young men brandishing weapons ranging from knives, machetes and sticks disrupted a consultation meeting Senator Suleiman Uthman Hunkuyi was having with his supporters in Kaduna.

The injured have been rushed to the Barau Dilkko Hospital for treatment.

The senator was interacting with members and stakeholders from the local government areas that makes the Kaduna central zone at the Endwell Conference Hotel in Kaduna when the thugs broke into the venue of the meeting.

The thugs numbering about 15 came in at about 3:15 PM when the meeting was about to be rounded off and startedÂ  hitting the vehicles parked by the gate of the hotel with their weapons.

The sight of the hoodlums holding weapons and the sound they made while breaking the vehicles brought the meeting to an end as people took to their heels when the police started shooting in the air to disperse the thugs.
