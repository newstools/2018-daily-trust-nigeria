I wish to draw the attention of the government and relevant stakeholders to the Bida-Suleja road. It has become an embarrassing situation and I will like the federal government and the Niger State Government in particular to treat it as a matter of urgent state and national importance. The Bida-Suleja road in Niger State has about the highest number of potholes in the country and it has become a death trap for motorists and commuters. The road is so bad that vehicles that ply it always end up in mechanic workshops. And the importance of this road cannot be overemphasised as it links Jebba, Mokwa, Ilorin, Lagos; among others to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Due to the bad condition of the road, vehicles have to reduce their speed and that exposes them to robbers who operate along that route. These robbers attack drivers and motorists. Bida, as a community is predominantly occupied by farmers and with the rainy season approaching, there is need for the road to be repaired so that farmers can transport their goods to other parts of the country with ease.  At the moment, people around the area have resorted to sand-filling the portholes, but that is only a temporary measure. Those charged with the responsibility of maintaining roads across the federation should please take necessary action. When the road is fixed, economic activities  in that area will be enhanced, just as lives and property of citizens will be secured.
