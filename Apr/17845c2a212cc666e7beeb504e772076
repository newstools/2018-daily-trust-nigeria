Men of the Sokoto Area Command of the Nigerian Customs Service have raided a house allegedly owned by a high ranking politician in Sokoto State and recovered exotic vehicles, including SUV Lexus jeeps and Toyota Avensis cars. There were divergent views about the number of the vehicles impounded during the late hour raid. A witness told our reporter that he counted about 160 vehicles while they were being driven away by men of the Customs. Another source put the number at 160 but a Customs officer who pleaded not to be named said they were less than 100. The vehicles were discovered in a fenced house at Ruggan Waru area along Aliyu Shinkafi Polytechnic, Sokoto. Daily Trust could not confirm the owner of the vehicles or the house in which they were discovered as at the time of filing this report but a source said the vehicles belonged to a prominent politician. “The vehicles were not brought at the same time. They brought them in pieces and in the night. You will hardly see the place opened in broad daylight,” the source said. The source added that Customs officers were backed by the military who were well armed during the operation which was said to have lasted for hours. The spokesman of the Nigeria Customs in Sokoto, Mai lafiya, said he would not comment as the Area Comptroller would address a press conference later.
