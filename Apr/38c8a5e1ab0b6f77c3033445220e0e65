President Muhammadu Buhari did not write to the National Assembly on his trip to the United Kingdom, Daily Trust has gathered. At plenary session yesterday, Senate President Bukola Saraki read four letters from the president, excluding the one on his trip to UK. Buhari had previously written to the National Assembly in line with section 145(1) of the 1999 Constitution. The president departed the country on Monday for UK and is expected to be there till April 20. A source close to the leadership of the Senate confirmed to our correspondent that the President has not written any letter to the National Assembly notifying it on his trip. “The four letters from the President were read on the floor. I don’t think he has transmitted any letter on his trip,” he said, pleading not to be named. But another source said there was no need for the president to write to the assembly on the visit. “He didn’t go on vacation. If you read through the statement issued by his media aide, it showed that he is going there on official assignments. So, there is no need for any letter,” he said.
