Three persons were burnt to death after their bus caught fire at Sabon Gari village, on Abuja-Lokoja road. A witness said the accident happened at about 3:13a.m. on Monday when a J5 bus with registration number JKA 567XF crashed into a ditch and went up in flames. He said the driver and two other passengers in the front were trapped and seriously burnt before any assistance could come their way, adding that men of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) later arrived the scene to remove the burnt corpses. When contacted, the Yangoji unit commander of the FRSC, Assistant Corps Commander (ACC) Joseph Samgbaza, confirmed the accident, which he attributed to speed limit violation and loss of control. He said the three burnt corpses had been handed over to their relatives for burial at Lokoja. City News also gathered that three persons were injured in another accident which occurred on Monday evening near Gwako village on Gwagwalada- Zuba road. It was learnt that the accident involved a Golf car without registration number. The driver was said to have lost control of his steering and hit a concrete pavement leaving three persons injured.
