A yet to be identified passenger has died  while  23 others sustained injuries in  a crash that occurred on Saturday night at Manderegi village,  near Abaji,  on Abuja-Lokoja road. A witness said the crash happened at about 8:15pm and involved a 18-seater commuter bus with registration number KF 253 RSH and a Coaster bus with registration number RSH 875 PJ. He said the 18-seater bus slid while it was raining and rammed into the Coaster bus and both crashed into a ditch. He said men of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) arrived the scene to evacuate the victims and the corpse to  hospital. When contacted, the Abaji unit commander of the FRSC, ACC Olasupo Esuruoso, confirmed the accident which he attributed to speed limit violation and loss of control. He said the rescue was jointly carried out by Abaji and Yangoji unit commands, and that the victims were  taken to Abaji General Hospital and Ayaura primary health centre. Our reporter also gathered that two persons were injured  in another crash which occurred on the same road last Friday at Omoko village.  It was learnt that the accident involved a Toyota Hilux with registration number 20A856FG, and that the driver lost control while on top speed.
