President Muhammadu Buhari is scheduled to depart for London, the United Kingdom, on Monday. A Presidency source disclosed this to our correspondent yesterday. The source, who pleaded anonymity, said that the trip was to enable the president to attend to some private matters. The source, however, refused to give the details of those private matters. The presidentâ€™s private visit is ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) scheduled to hold in London from April 15 to 20. When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, declined comment. President Buhari was in London last year, for several months, to receive treatment for an undisclosed ailment.
