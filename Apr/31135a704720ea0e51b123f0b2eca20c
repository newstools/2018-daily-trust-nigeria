The Senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District, Dino Melaye has been handcuffed to a hospital bed at the National Hospital, Abuja by the Police.

PUNCH is reporting that visitors were also not allowed to see the embattled senator, who was forcefully evacuated by the police from a private medical facility, Zankli Hospital and taken to the National Hospital, where he was admitted to the Trauma Centre on Tuesday night.

It was also gathered that some senators who visited him on Wednesday (today) were barred by the police from entering the ward where Melaye was being cared for.

Melaye who jumped from a moving police vehicle on Tuesday while being taken to Lokoja, Kogi State, was conveyed in an ambulance to Zanklin Hospital, Mabushi, Abuja, after sustaining some injuries from his scuffle with his police escorts.

But the police on Tuesday evening stormed the private hospital and evacuated him to the National Hospital, against his doctorsâ€™ advice.

The lawmaker was taken in a police ambulance marked NPF 221 D around 10pm.

Two doctors from the hospital were also reportedly taken away by the police.

The National Hospital spokesman, Dr. Tayo Haastrup, confirmed to PUNCH that Melaye was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday night.
