After subjecting residents of Lagos State University (LASU) quarters located within Iba Housing Estate, Ojo in Lagos to two months of darkness, the management of Eko Electricity Distribution Company (Eko Disco) has restored electricity to the community finally. This followed the intervention of the Minister for Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola. The LASU quarters had its power disconnected for over 8 weeks ago following allegation that the residents owed the power company over N6million worth of service charges between Year 2010 and 2018. The spokesperson of the school, Mr. Ilesanmi Olugbenga, said that the school management failed to pay the electricity bills because it was inflated, and does not reflect the power consumed at the school. He explained that this is not the first time the Eko Disco will give the school “crazy bill,” adding that some old lecturers who had lived in the quarters between year 2010 and 2017 failed to pay for electricity during their stay. It will be recall that earlier this year, the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwummi Ambode, met with the two parties to find an amicable solution to the lack of power supply in the quarters. However, both groups couldn't reach a concensus at the meeting. But following the intervention of the Power minister, the rift over the “crazy bill” was resolved. Some of the residents who spoke with Daily Trust said that the Minster of Power asked them to document their power usage for the month of April, adding that Fashola directed the Disco to give them prepaid meter beginning from next month (May).
