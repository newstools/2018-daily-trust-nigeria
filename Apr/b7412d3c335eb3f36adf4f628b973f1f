The Chairman of Kwali Area Council, Joseph K.  Shazin, has banned illegal felling of trees in the area. Shazin, who addressed newsmen shortly after a closed door meeting with traditional rulers, village and district heads of the council on Saturday, said the ban was a collective resolution among the traditional rulers. He said the illegal felling of trees across the council has resulted to deforestation. He said the illegal felling of trees especially for charcoal business and wood logging has made the environment vulnerable to deforestation, adding that they would soon hold another stakeholders meeting whereby a bye-law would be enacted to end their activities. “We have unanimously resolved and agreed to ban illegal cutting of trees across the council,” he said. Also speaking, the Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo (III), said aside the ban, it was agreed that everybody must plant five trees in their respective domains in order to curtail the problem of deforestation.
