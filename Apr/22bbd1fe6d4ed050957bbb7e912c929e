The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has accused the state government of annexing the farmland belonging to Benin Owena River Basin for the development of Benin Industrial Park.  The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Chris Nehikhare, alleged in a statement that the state government had taken the farmland belonging to the Benin Owena River Basin Authority situated at Obayantor, in Ipoba Okha local government area. He further alleged that as a result of the authority’s refusal to let go of the land, the state government brought in thugs and bulldozers to start the destruction and annexation of the land.  The PDP said, “It is clear now that the state government had no plans to build an industrial park because after performing ground breaking ceremony, these fights, blackmail, intimidation and annexation would not have been necessary, as a proper plan would have existed.” Responding, the state government said the Benin Industrial Park (BIP) project was fully on course as there was no fight between it and the federal government. A statement signed by Governor Godwin Obaseki’s spokesman, Crusoe Osagie, said, “It is laughable that they will try to concoct a non-existent feud between Edo state and federal government.”
