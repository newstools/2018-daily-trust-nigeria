A 42-year-old man, Mr Henshawell Ogbuenyi, told an Ogba chief magistrate’s court how his wife was always beating him up at the slightest provocation. Ogbuenyi told the court  on Friday that his wife, Rita, 28, would descend on him anytime they had any little disagreement. The man, who resides at House 18, Diamond Estate, Ikeja, is asking the court to dissolve their 13-year-old marriage. Ogbuenyi said, “Truth is bitter, but I am not ashamed to say it, my wife is the husband and I am the wife. My wife is a fighter who takes delight in beating me up.” He said Rita had oppressed and intimidated him to the extent that he became helpless and afraid of her in their matrimonial home. The police prosecutor, Christopher John, told the court that the assault on the complainant came to the open recently when he reported Rita at the station and the accused was arrested. The presiding magistrate, Mr Peter Nwaka, granted her bail in the sum of N100,000, with one surety who should show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State government. The defendant was remanded in prison custody pending when she will perfect her bail conditions. The matter was adjourned till May 22, 2018.
