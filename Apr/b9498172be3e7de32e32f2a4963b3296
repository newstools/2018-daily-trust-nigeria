The Senate has commenced moves to replace the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and the National Commission of Colleges of Education (NCCE) with new agencies. In this regard, two bills sponsored by Senator Barau Jibrin (APC, Kano) have passed first reading. The draft laws are expected to be listed for second reading, when lawmakers resume plenary next week from Easter break. The proposal seeks to repeal the NBTE Act and establish the National Commission for Technical, Vocational and Entrepreneurial Education (NCTVEE). When established, NCTVEE, according to a publication of the Senate seen by our correspondent, would advise the Federal Government on all aspects of technical, vocational and entrepreneurial education in the country. The National Commission for Teachers Education (NCTE) is to replace the NCCE, according the new proposal. The commission is to advise the Federal Government on all aspects of teacher education in the country. In a phone interview, Jibrin said the bills were part of proposed legislation conceived to address the challenges facing the countryâ€™s education sector.
