The FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has flagged-off the 2018 vaccination of livestock in Gwagwalada. Bello, who was represented by the Agriculture and Rural Development Secretary, Stanley Ifeanyi Chukwu, urged owners of livestock and cattle to take advantage of the mass treatment exercise by bringing their animals for vaccination. He said the exercise would enhance healthier livestock breeds which, he added, would produce quality and healthy milk. He said the exercise was part of his administration’s effort to ensure food security and prevent the outbreak and spread of livestock diseases across the FCT. The minister, however, reiterated the commitment of his administration towards ensuring that only healthy livestock were safe for consumption. “I will also commend the area councils for their support since we started this programme, while I assure you that my administration will continue to give priority to the agricultural sector,”  he said. Also speaking, the Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, commended the minister for the vaccination of livestock in the FCT. He assured that the council would mobilize its agric department to ensure that it carried out the vaccination exercise across the area.
