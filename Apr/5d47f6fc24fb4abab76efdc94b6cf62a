The Senate yesterday confirmed the nomination of Mr Anthony Ojukwu as the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). It also confirmed the nomination of Professor James Momoh as Chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). The confirmation followed presentation and consideration of the reports of the committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal matters on Ojukwu’s screening and that of the committee on power that screened Momoh. While the report on Ojukwu’s confirmation was presented by Senator Babajide Omoworare (APC, Osun); that of Momoh was presented by Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe (PDP, Abia). The two committees recommended the confirmation of the nominees. Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu who presided over the plenary urged the appointees to live up to expectation. He said Ojukwu’s confirmation came at a time when cases of human rights abuses were on the increase in the country.
