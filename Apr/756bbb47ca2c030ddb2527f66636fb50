An Abuja Grade 1 Area Court sitting in Gwagwa, Abuja, has summoned one Yahaya Abdullahi before it after his wife approached the court seeking to know about their marriage status. Sa’adiya Adamu had complained to the court that their marriage of eight years which had been blessed with three children, was in trouble ever since her husband got wedded to a second wife. She told the court that the recent misunderstanding started about five months ago when her husband asked her to go to her family house where she is currently living. Abdullahi who did not argue the allegation told the court that, “My intention initially was to make her stay away from her matrimonial home for about one month in order to correct her  attitude towards me, but I have to shelve the plan after she went to our home and packed all her property.” Sa’adiya, however, told the court that she took the action after her husband sent her a message through his younger brother informing her to choose whether she wished to continue with the marriage or wanted out. The judge, Adam H. Aliyu, gave Abdullahi two weeks to take a stand on his marriage to Sa’adiya. He warned the man that the law does not permit a husband to leave his wife to live under uncertainty, hence he should either take care of all her needs, or divorce her. The matter was adjourned to April 12 for next sitting.
