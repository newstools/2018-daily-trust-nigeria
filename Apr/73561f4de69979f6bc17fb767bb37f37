Many people, mostly children between the ages of four and 12 have died as a result of outbreak of suspected meningitis and cholera in Dan Iyau,  Karaje , Dutsinma villages in Katsina State. Ten people have died in Dan Iyau village, eight in Karaje village both of Batarawa local government area, and seven in Dutsinma College of Education. Most of the deceased had complained of severe fever, headache and vomiting before their death. A parent, Aminu Suleiman who lost his 12-year-old daughter, Hasiya, said she had returned from a trip and came down with severe leg pain, fever and stomach ache before she died. “We lost close to eight children in this town. My neighbour also lost a child just as another friend of mine in downtown lost a boy,” he said. The village head of Dan Iyau, Suleiman Abdullahi, confirmed that 10 people had so far died within a week in his domain. Only last Friday, Isa Kaita College of Education, Dutsinma, was shut after the death of seven students. The decision to close down the school for two weeks was reached after an emergency meeting of the school’s academic board held last Friday, a source confided in our reporter. However, the spokesman of the college, Malam Muntari Bala, said the school was not shut, that it only went on a midterm break. He admitted that four of the students had died within a month but that the causes were different. “One died from accident, one fell sick and went home and died and two died within the school,” he said, adding, “We used to have all those rumours, that over 20 students of the college have died. This is not so.” It could be recalled that last month alone, two students of the Federal University Dutsinma died in similar circumstances, just as eight students of Science Secondary School Kurfi died from related causes. Also, eight deaths were recorded at Jaja village of Ganagarawa ward in Jibia Local Government Area.
