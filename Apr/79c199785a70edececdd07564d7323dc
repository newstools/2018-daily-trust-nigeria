A jury in the United States has found Bolivian ex-President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada responsible for the deaths of dozens of protesters in 2003. His Defence Minister, Carlos Sánchez, was also found responsible in the civil lawsuit. Their lawyers said they would appeal against the decision. The plaintiffs accused the two men of ordering the Bolivian military to use force to break up the 2003 protests. The victims’ families were awarded $10m (£7m) in damages. The families welcomed the decision saying it gave them “great satisfaction”. They also expressed the hope that it would not be overturned on appeal. The case was brought under a law that permits civil suits in US courts for extrajudicial killings. The lawsuit was brought by eight families whose loved ones died during protests against plans to export natural gas from Bolivia to the US.
