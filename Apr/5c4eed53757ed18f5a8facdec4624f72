A German court has rejected “rebellion” as grounds to extradite Catalonia’s ex-leader Carles Puigdemont and ordered his release on bail. The Schleswig-Holstein court said he could still face corruption charges in Spain, and it has only suspended extradition - not ruled it out. He was arrested in the north German region last month, after Spain issued a European Arrest Warrant. Spain charged top Catalan separatists over October’s independence referendum. The court has been considering what to do about a Spanish extradition request for Mr Puigdemont for more than a week. Mr Puigdemont faces charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of public funds in Spain as a result of his role in last year’s Catalan banned independence referendum.
