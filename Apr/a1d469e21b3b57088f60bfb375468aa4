A 39-year-old trader, Fausat Hammed, who allegedly stole her neighbour’s 2-month old baby, was on Monday brought before an Ebute Meta Magistrates’ Court. Hammed is facing trial on a charge of stealing a child. She, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Prosecutor, Insp. Chinalu Uwadione, told the court that the offence was committed on April 16, at No. 49, Giwa St., Ijora, Badiya. He said that the accused who was pretending to rock Rafatu Hammed, quietly sneaked out with the baby. The offence, according to Uwadione, violates Section 277 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Magistrate, Mrs O.A. Adegite, admitted the accused to bail in the sum of N400, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She adjourned the case until May 23, for mention.
