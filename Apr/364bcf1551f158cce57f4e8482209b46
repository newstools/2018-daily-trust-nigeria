An eight-month-old boy was yesterday found dead inside a water container in his father’s room at Obakhavbaye, in Oredo local government area of Edo State. A resident told journalists yesterday that the infant, Abdulaziz Abubakar Aji, the second child of his mother, got missing in the night, and  the parents raised an alarm in the morning and some tenants joined them in a search. The resident said the boy’s father, Abubakar Aji, later found the boy’s corpse inside a plastic container filled with water when he went to fetch water from it. A source said, “The mother of the boy was said to have gone to the toilet but on getting back to her room, she no longer saw her child. It is believed that the perpetrator capitalized on the absence of the mother to dump the boy inside the water container and cover it.” The parents rejected a request for comment. The parents and the father’s second wife have been taken by men of the Aideyan Divisional Police Headquarters. The state Commissioner of Police, Babatunde Johnson Kokumo, said the police would be investigating the likelihood that somebody carried out the act “because the infant could not have entered the water container by himself.”
