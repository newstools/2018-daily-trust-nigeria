Justice Mojisola Olatoregun sitting at the Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday threw out an application from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission  (EFCC) asking it to forfeit various sums of money and properties linked to a former first lady, Dame Patience Jonathan. Striking out the application for interim forfeiture of monies belonging to Patience Jonathan and Lawari Furniture Ltd, the court berated the EFCC for carrying out media trial against suspects rather than doing justice to accused persons. Justice Olatoregun held that it was an abuse of court process to file similar cases such as the one before her in different divisions of the Federal High Court as the EFCC did before Justice Nyako, herself and Justice Tsoho of  Abuja and Lagos divisions of the same Federal High Court.
