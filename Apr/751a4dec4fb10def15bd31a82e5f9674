The Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Kwali, on Sunday celebrated its 90th anniversary. The senior pastor of the church, Rev. Moses Barnabas, said the journey has been quite challenging especially during the reign of the pioneer pastor of the church. He said it was a thing of joy to see members of the church embrace Christ after the initial challenges of evangelizing the mostly heathen population and ensuring the welfare of the members. He said the light of Christ was now shining through the church members and all to love one another, adding “because Christ told us to love one another, so as we are celebrating today, we should also reflect back how united our people were in the past.” Also speaking, the Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo, who also attended the church’s  90th anniversary, said since he was born and brought up into the Christian family, it has become necessary for him to attend and join other Christians and pastors to celebrate the church 90th anniversary. “As a Muslim, I know it will be a surprise that I am here to attend a Christian occasion, but since I was born into a Christian family, I see the need to come and felicitate with my brothers for their 90th anniversary,” he said.
