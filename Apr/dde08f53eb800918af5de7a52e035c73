The woman who is set to become the seventh wife of South Africa’s ex-President Jacob Zuma has been forced to resign from her job at She Conquers, a non-governmental organisation, local media reports.  Nonkanyiso Conco’s “affiliation” with Mr Zuma - 52 years her senior - was contrary to the organisation’s campaign to “empower young women in every phase of their lives”, and to end reliance on sugar daddies, She Conquers’ leadership said in a statement quoted by Daily Maverick news site. Ms Conco, 24, gave birth to Mr Zuma’s child last week, in what staff at a private hospital in the coastal city of Durban described as a “VIP delivery”. Mr Zuma, 76, currently has four wives, including one from whom he is separated, and more than 20 children. A fifth wife took her own life in 2000, and a sixth one - who was his preferred presidential successor - divorced him in 2008.
