A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Food Bank Initiative (FBI), has donated foodstuff to some indigent students of the University of Abuja. Chairman of the FBI, Adewole Adedeji, while presenting the food items to the students at the permanent site of the university on Airport Road, Abuja, yesterday, said the gesture was to put smiles on the faces of the downtrodden especially among the indigent students. He said the gesture was part of the NGO’s corporate social responsibility to cater for the needs of the society. He said the organisation had been assisting orphans and widows in the society. Some of the benefiting students  thanked the organisation for identifying with the indigent students, and called on corporate organisations and wealthy individuals to emulate the gesture of the NGO. Among the food items donated to the students were, bags of rice, cartons of noodles, cartoons of seasoning cubes, soft drinks and spaghetti as well as the NGO’s T-shirts to some of the students.
