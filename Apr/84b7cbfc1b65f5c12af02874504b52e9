The Victims Support Fund (VSF) and the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to commission a research that focuses on critical perspectives of the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria. The Executive Director of VSF, Sunday Ochoche said the research, titled,” Insurgency and Counter-Insurgency in Nigeria: Critical Perspectives on Boko Haram,” is aimed, among others things, to critically examine the conceptual issues on insurgency and counter-insurgency, the origin and evolution of Boko Haram, post-conflict peace building and the implications of Boko Haram insurgency for national security in Nigeria. According to him, the outcome of the project which will gulp a sum of N75.8million, will provide a more scientific understanding of the insurgency, general national consensus and narrative of the insurgency. “The research outcome will provide more evidence-based policy development and implementation framework; and a basis for more informed and efficient provision of national security”, he added. In his remarks, the Provost of NDA, Professor Azubuike Nwankwo, said the research will, for the first time, provide evidence-based narrative of the insurgency.
