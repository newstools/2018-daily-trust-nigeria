The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has described last Wednesday’s invasion of the upper chamber of the National Assembly as a great threat to democracy. The SDP National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Alfa Mohammed, condemned the action while reacting to the development yesterday in Abuja. The party, which said all lovers of democracy should rise against the “dangerous development”, urged  security agencies to do more than recovering the mace by digging deep to get and prosecute the sponsors of the invasion. Mohammed said the development was also a rehearsal for the orchestration of crisis on a larger scale in the country. “We have all struggled to get this democracy we are now enjoying. We should not allow any over ambitious politician or surrogates of politicians to derail it,” he said.
