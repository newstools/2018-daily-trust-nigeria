The Nigerian Army yesterday denied reports that it was discriminating and preventing certain ethnic groups from being recruited into the Army in the on-going exercise. The Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Texas Chukwu, in a statement  stressed that the Nigerian Army would remain apolitical in the discharge of its constitutional roles. He pointed out that no state of the federation, including Adamawa State would be exempted as alleged by the mischief makers circulating the false reports online. The statement reads in part, “the Nigerian Army wishes to state categorically that the allegation is not only untrue but unfounded and unsubstantiated. “This is the handy work of unscrupulous elements attempting to drag the good name of the Army in the mud. “For avoidance of doubt and to set the record straight, the Nigerian Army wishes to state that every eligible Nigerian is qualified to be recruited into the Nigerian Army provided such individual meets the set standards. “All the candidates for the recruitment exercise from Demsa, Numan, Lamurde and  Girei Local Government Areas are currently participating in  the on-going recruitment exercise like any other candidates.
