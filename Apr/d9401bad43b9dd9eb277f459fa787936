The Nashirullahi Fathi Society of Nigeria (NASFAT) has condemned the killings in Benue, Taraba and Nassarawa states. The President of NASFAT, Engr. Kamil Bolarinwa, said in a statement signed by the Publicity Secretary of the society, Alhaji Banji Busari, that at a time when everyone had heaved a sigh of relief about the successes against Boko Haram insurgency, Nigerians were again jolted with the sad news of the killing of some clerics and several others Tuesday in Benue State. He said, “Islam as a religion holds lives so sacred that its Holy Book decrees that whoever kills a soul is like he has killed the entire mankind (Q5:32). While we seek collective efforts of all and sundry to ensure that peace reigns supreme in all parts of our dear country, caution should however be exercised not to ascribe religious colouration into this senseless killing. Anyone who breaks law and order should be dealt with within the ambit of the law, regardless of his race, tribe or religion. Moreover, the perpetrators have never come out to say they are fighting religious war, nor has any intelligence report pointed in that direction.”
