An Ibadan based school teacher, Romoke Ademoyegun on Wednesday asked an Iletuntun Customary Court in Ibadan, to terminate 11 year-old union between her and one Sunday Ademoyegun over persistent threat to her life. In her statement, Romoke accused her husband of frequently subjecting her to violence which had resulted into loss of two pregnancies. “My lord, I have endured enough battery and maltreatment in my 11 years union with Sunday as a spouse. Any slightest opportunity in the house, he unleashed punches, slaps and even kicks on me not minding whatever may be happening to me. As a result of his many violence against me, I lost a three months old pregnancy in 2015 and recently on April 1, 2018, I lost another two and a half months pregnancy after he had beaten the hell out of me,”  she said. “At a given time, I had to move to my father’s home, Sunday came there to attack me and mercilessly beat me as usual. I have reported him times without number to his people and series of intervention from my parents have yielded no result on him. Besides, Sunday has no milk of human kindness in him because he does not cater for the needs of the children and I.  I have all along been responsible for the payment of the house rent, children’s sustenance and my TV set and cell phone are still in his custody,” Romoke explained. The respondent who could not deny any of the allegations leveled against him strongly opposed the divorce suit. Sunday who earned his living as a film artist simply pleaded with the court to settle the matter for him and his spouse. “My lord, I can’t start searching for another wife at this stage, it was never our agreement that we will be parting ways now. Besides, who does Romoke want to take charge of the children,” Sunday lamented. However, Chief Henry Agbaje, the president of the court, asked the duo to furnish the court with more evidence to substantiate their arguments. Agbaje adjourned the case till April 23 for judgment.
