A suspected thief identified only as Nuhu on Sunday escaped being mobbed by a crowd when he was allegedly caught attempting to pick the pocket of an unsuspecting member of the public at Jabi Lake Park, Jabi, Abuja. The victim who does not want his name in print said, “While I was watching a game of tennis in the park, I felt a hand in my pocket and I instinctively grabbed it. But the pickpocket struggled and got himself free and took to his heels. “On raising alarm, the suspect attempted to escape but some visitors to the park grabbed him and the crowd started hitting him.” Ismail Saidu, who said he  is a regular visitor to the park, said the spate of theft in park was becoming alarming. “Last week, a car was stolen in this same park. It is disturbing that this park is becoming unsafe,” he added. City News learnt that it took the intervention of a military officer in the park to save the suspect from being lynched. The suspect was subsequently handed over to the police at the outpost opposite Jabi Lake. The Life Camp Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Danlami Yunusa did not pick calls made to his mobile phone neither did he reply to a text message requesting for information about the arrest of the suspect.
