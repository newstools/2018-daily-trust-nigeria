The Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), Itse Sagay, yesterday hinted on the creation of a special fund for financial reward for pre-emptive whistleblowing. He dropped the hint at an evaluation workshop on the federal government’s Whistleblower Policy and the role of the Inter-Agency Asset Tracing Team in Abuja. “I think a fund is going to be created to reward those who give information that prevents corruption and saves the country from being looted in any aspect,’’ Sagay said.
