The Supreme Court has fixed July 6 for judgement in the appeal by Senate President Bukola Saraki seeking to dismiss charges against him at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). Justice Musa Mohammed Dattijo, who presided over the matter yesterday, fixed the date after listening to argument by lawyers in the matter. Counsel to Saraki, Kanu Agabi (SAN) had told the apex court that the 18-count charges against his client at the CCT were frivolous and no prima facie case was established against him. He said the case against Saraki by the Federal Government was in bad faith since the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), which was empowered by law to investigate him did not do so, rather a report of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was used to prepare the charges against him. He argued that the CCT was right in dismissing the charges during a ruling in his no case submission because the purported report of EFCC was hearsay in law. However, counsel to the Federal Government, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) asked the court to hold that Saraki has case to answer in the charges. He submitted that there was no law that an investigation must be conducted before charges could be preferred against any defendant. The Court of Appeal had in December 2017 ordered Saraki to return to the CCT to face charges in 3 of the 18-count charges.
