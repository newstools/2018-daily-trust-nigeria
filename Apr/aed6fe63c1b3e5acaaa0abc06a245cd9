The leaders of the UK, France and Germany have agreed that pursuing the current deal with Iran is the best way to stop it developing nuclear weapons. Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel discussed the importance of maintaining the existing deal in separate phone calls over the weekend. But they also agreed on the need to address some of the concerns raised by US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump is due to decide in the coming weeks whether to abandon the deal. He has been a strong critic of the 2015 international accord, calling it “insane”. In a statement on Sunday, Downing Street said Mrs May had agreed with her European counterparts that the Iran nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) was “the best way of neutralising the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran”.
