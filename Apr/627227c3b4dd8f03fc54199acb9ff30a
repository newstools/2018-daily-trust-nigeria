American researchers have remade the cancer’s genetic landscape by reclassifying tumors into 28 different molecular “clusters,’’ in a largest-ever cancer genomic investigation. The study, published on Thursday in the journal Cell, revealed new possibilities for novel immune-based cancer therapeutics. It provided a push for clinicians to obtain and utilise comprehensive genomic information to enrol their patients into specialised “basket’’ or “umbrella’’ clinical trials. “The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),’’ funded by the National Institutes of Health, completed the genetic sequencing and analyses of about 10,000 tumors from patients spanning 33 types of cancer. TCGA also focused on identifying similarities between cancers based on changes in their genes, and the way their genes are expressed. They used a technique called molecular clustering, which groups tumors by parameters such as genes being expressed, abnormality of chromosome numbers in tumor cells and DNA modifications. Researchers discovered that some cancers grouped together based on the cell type from which the tumor came from. Christopher Benz, an oncologist at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging said, new TCGA data hold particular promise for expanding treatments designed to enlist the immune system to beat cancer, including approved immunotherapies now showing extremely promising results against a limited number of classical cancer types.
