The Executive Director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Awwal Musa Rafsanjani, on reasons why many of the lawmakers may not return, said bad representation is one of them. “Some of the legislators when they go there they destroy the integrity of their representation. They don’t actually represent anybody but themselves. They create opportunities for themselves only using the Legislature for recklessness, abuse, intimidation, extortion, misconduct and rascality. This kind of thing angers constituents not to re-elect their representatives. There are many legislators that have demonstrated irresponsible representation. So, many constituents mobilize against them during elections.” Rafsanjani also said there is lack of understanding of the role of the legislature, and what the constituents need to do to support their representatives to effectively represent them. “There is also the issue of the political tsunami like we saw in 2015. So, no matter how good you are, if there’s a political tsunami, you have to go.” But Rafsanjani said he believes the kind of political tsunami that happened in 2015 would not be possible in 2019, saying “People can’t just put their posters with that of Buhari and expect electorate to vote them again.” “A lot of effort and resources have been put to train the legislators within the period they’re serving. If they don’t come back, there’s no way in which you’ll harness what has been invested. A lawmaker goes with all the knowledge and experience, without creating avenue where he or she gives back to the institution to improve the quality of the legislature. Of course, there are some legislators whose return is not even a blessing to the nation. If those kinds of legislators don’t come back, there’s no issue at all.”
