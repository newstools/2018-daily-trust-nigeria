Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, two days after a similar protest was broken up by the police, leaving two people dead and several seriously injured. The protesters carried the victim’s coffin to a public square where they continued to denounce new electoral laws. Supporters of the opposition politician and former President Marc Ravalomanana say the legislation aims to block him from running in this year’s elections.
