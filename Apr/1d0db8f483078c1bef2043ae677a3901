The Director-General, Kwara Signage and Advertisement Agency, Alhaji Ahmad Olufadi, has confirmed that rainstorm, with its attendant rain that fell heavily on Monday in different parts of Ilorin, damaged more than 20 billboards. Olufadi told our correspondent in llorin yesterday that many billboards and signposts fell at various locations during the heavy downpour. He said the agency had removed from the roads damaged billboards and signposts it deemed capable of constituting a danger to motorists and pedestrians. “The agency is still counting the actual number of damaged billboards damaged by the rainstorm in various parts of llorin,” he said. The Director-General said two of the billboards belonging to the state government had already been evacuated from the road and repaired. He warned owners of the remaining damaged billboards in the capital to urgently evacuate them for repair to allow free movement of vehicles and pedestrians. He added that the agency would commence evacuation of the remaining damaged billboards, which could only be reclaimed by their owners upon payment of fines. It would be recalled that rainstorm preceded heavy rains in many parts of Ilorin on Monday, wreaking havoc on many buildings, including places of worship.
