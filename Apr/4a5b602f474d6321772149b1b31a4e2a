President Muhammadu Buhari said given the condition his administration met the country, ‘without savings and the economy badly vandalized,’ he has “not done too badly.” Presidential spokesman Femi Adesina quoted Buhari as saying this in London yesterday while receiving the Buhari Diaspora Support Organization led by Mr Charles Efe Sylvester. President Buhari said wicked people plundered the country and kept the citizens poor. He also assured Nigerians that he would do his best to justify their trust in him and that their confidence “won’t be abused.” “I am happy that people like you are here, on your own, defending the country. You have shown courage and sacrifice. I assure you that your confidence in us won’t be abused, we will do our best to justify it,” he said. Buhari, who affirmed that Nigeria was gifted with tremendous human and natural resources, however, regretted that “failure of some of the leadership we had in the past led to our not being able to capitalize on resources to improve the lot of the people.” Sylvester was quoted as saying that they were happy with the achievements of the Buhari administration so far.
