Some unknown gunmen shot and killed a middle aged man, Mr. Francis Udupa, and injured a vigilante member at Yimi village near Zuba. A resident of the village, who identified himself as Shedrack, said the incident happened last Tuesday at about 1:20a.m. when some unknown gunmen with AK 47 invaded the village and opened fire on the deceased. He said the deceased was sleeping in front of his house because of excessive heat, when the unknown gunmen came to his house and shot him. He said neighbours heard the sound of gunshot and raised alarm, which he said attracted the attention of some vigilantes who were on patrol in the area. The vigilante members rushed to the scene when the gunmen shot one of the vigilantes in the back,” he said. A vigilante member who preferred anonymity confirmed the incident to our reporter, saying their member was shot as they attempted to go after the gunmen. “We later took him to the hospital in Gwagwalada, where the bullet was removed and we thank God he is responding to treatment,” he said. Our reporter learnt that the corpse of the deceased which was deposited at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital in Gwagwalada, had been taken to Ibaji Local Government of Kogi State, by his relatives for burial. When contacted, the spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, said the police were still investigating the incident.
