A retired Supreme Court judge and Nigeria’s High Commissioner to the UK, Ambassador George Oguntade has advocated the adoption of plea bargain by the Federal Government to reduce the volume of cases in the courts. Ambassador Oguntade, who gave the advice in an interview with Daily Trust in London, said through plea bargain, offender’s image is tarnished even though he may get a lighter sentence, adding that “It is a civilised way of reducing congestion in our courts”. He explained that when one admits guilt or is found guilty and is punished, “he is tarnished all the same because the plea of guilty or being found guilty is to degrade a man from being taken as honest, to one that is a crook”. On his message to Nigerians in the UK, Ambassador Oguntade lamented that many of them were getting involved in malpractices of criminal nature in recent times, and urged them to always remember that they were representatives of the whole people of Nigeria.
