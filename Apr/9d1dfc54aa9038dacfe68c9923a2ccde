Kano state police command has resolved to intensify security in banks across the state with a view to protecting lives and properties of the banking customers. The state’s Commissioner of Police, Mr. Rabi’u Yusuf who disclosed this yesterday while briefing the press shortly after a roundtable discussion with managers of various banks operating in Kano, said the decision was reached to forestall a repeat of tragic attack on the industry. He described the recent armed robbery attack in Offa, Kwara state as the most deadly on banking sector in recent times, and thus reiterated the commitment and determination of the command to averting any similar incident in Kano state. Yusuf said “we decided to invite bank managers to a round table discussion to share ideas on how we can enhance the security of Kano state most especially the security of the banking industry in view of what happened in Offa Kwara state. So the crux of the matter is to take proactive measures to ensure that we do not experience such an ugly situation here in Kano.” Branch controller of the Central Bank of Nigeria in Kano state Hajiya Amina Abubakar commended the state police command over the proactive approach to handling security challenges at the banks and pledged to support the initiative for the safety and security of the industry in the state.
