The first South African convicted for racist abuse has lost her appeal and will have to serve her full prison sentence. Vicky Momberg was sentenced last month to three years in jail, with one year suspended, for using a derogatory word against a black police officer 48 times. Magistrate Pravina Rugoonandan dismissed her appeal, saying the sentence was “fair and just”, the AFP news agency reports. Racism remains a major issue in South Africa, almost 24 years after white minority rule ended.
