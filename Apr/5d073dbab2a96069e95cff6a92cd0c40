Following a petition by natives of the FCT that the University of Abuja was denying them admission and employment, the Vice Chancellor,  Prof. Michael Adikwu, has summoned the natives executives for a meeting. Speaking during the meeting, which was held on Tuesday, the vice chancellor, expressed concern over the plight  of the natives especially the applicants that were unable to gain admission into the institution. He assured them that qualified candidates would secure admission into the institution. He said the management was impressed with the natives’ approach of expressing their grievances, adding that his door remained open for them to channel their complaints to him. He further assured the group that the list of all the qualified applicants would be given consideration. Responding on behalf of the executives of the natives’ umbrella association, the spokesman, Ahmadu Yusuf Yunusa,  said the people were impressed with the response of the management which called them for dialogue. The spokesman said they would communicate to all their members and youths across  the FCT to put  on hold their  earlier scheduled peaceful protest.
