The Nigerian Army will punish any of its personnel who engages in partisan politics during the forthcoming general elections, Chief of Army Staff; Lt. General Tukur Yusufu Buratai said. To this end, Buratai has directed that special standing court martial be set up in preparation for the elections to try officers, who hobnob with politicians. Buratai who was speaking during the Chief of Army Staff first quarter conference in Abuja yesterday, warned that any Army personnel, “Found hobnobbing with politicians or being partisan will be investigated and sent to the special standing court martial.” He cautioned that any soldier in any capacity, who receives any form of inducement from politicians, public or private entities, knowingly or unknowingly would be ‘severely punished.’ “Both the giver and taker of such inducement will be investigated and appropriately sanctioned,” Buratai said. He stressed that any officer or soldier, who wishes to be sympathetic to a political, religious or ethnic group should voluntarily retire from the Nigerian Army. Buratai said the unity and integrity of Nigeria lies on the military and the Nigerian Army in particular saying, “Therefore any act inimical to the unity and integrity of this country by personnel of the Nigerian Army will be decisively dealt with”.
