The Acting Governor of Benue State, Engineer Benson Abounu, has warned those creating panic with alarms of attacks on innocent people in Makurdi and other towns of the state to desist from it but should rather help security agencies to guarantee peace. Abounu said on Friday that those taking advantage of the security situation in the state should stop forthwith as violence does not benefit anyone, stressing that the job of protecting lives and property is a task for every citizen. He described as inflammatory and unhelpful, a media report about the alleged killing of some members of the Hausa community in Makurdi and burning of mosques. He said the allegation was totally untrue and that the Benue State Police Command, Makurdi Local Government Chairman and other relevant authorities have alsoÂ  investigated and found it to be false. The acting governor further urged security agencies to carry out thorough investigation and arrest for prosecution, those behind the recent attacks on innocent people in Gwer East and West, Guma, Okpokwu, Logo and other local government areas. Also, he called on the people of the state to support security personnel with timely and useful information to enable them prevent further attacks on the state. Meanwhile, many schools in Makurdi metropolis remained under lock on Friday as rumours spread across the town about planned attacks on residents.
