The Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU), has called on its members nationwide to disregard all forms of threats to shelve the ongoing strike until their demands are met. This comes after the Nigeria Medical Association, (NMA) on Tuesday in a statement branded JOHESU as an “illegal body” which should not be listened to by the federal government. But yesterday at a press briefing in Abuja JOHESU chairman, Biobelemoye Josiah said the union is a recognised body and has the right to go on strike.
