A reading advocacy group, Reading Culture Advocacy Initiative (RCAI), has honoured six best students in the 2017 West African Examination Council (WAEC) from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The three best students from government and private schools were honoured by the group with cash awards and plaques. The group’s Executive Director, Dr Okoro Chukwudum, said they were honoured to encourage reading culture among students. While lamenting poor reading culture among students, he said most students spent time doing less important things like chatting on social media when they should be reading. He urged government and other stakeholders to celebrate the students as it was not enough to encourage them by only putting their names in the newspapers. One of the students who came second with six As and three Bs in the public school category, Anyacho Sopuruchukwu of Government Science Secondary School, Pykasa/Maitama, urged government to provide enough infrastructure in government schools so that students in private schools wouldn’t have a competitive edge. He commended the group for the honour adding that it would encourage him to do even better in his educational pursuit. Ameh Emmanuel Sunday of Government Science Secondary School came first in the public school category with eight distinctions and one B while Anyirigwo Victor of Government Day Secondary School, Dutse-Alhaji came third with six distinctions and three Bs. In the private school category, the three best students came from Loyola Jesuit College. Aniagoh William Daluchukwu came first with nine distinctions while Nwakoby Chidiogo Chelsea and Ekpunobi Ifeanyi Ogonna came second and third with eight distinctions and one B respectively.
