The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) said it has not suspended card issuance to successful enrolees. A statement by NIMC’s spokesman, Loveday Chika Ogbonna, said all individuals, upon completion of their enrolment, who have received an SMS are invited to proceed to the NIMC Office where they enrolled to pick up their cards from April 3. He said, “Persons who have not received an SMS can equally check the status of their cards on the NIMC website via www.nimc.gov.ng. “Citizens and legal residents, who have also relocated from where they enrolled are advised to visit any NIMC office closest to them to request a card transfer form, which they would fill, and submit to the State Coordinator for processing.’’ However, he said, Nigerians and Legal Residents are reminded that the National Identification Number (NIN) is the unique identifier and most important token issued by the Commission and not the physical e-ID Card. The NIN, is a set of 11 non-intelligent numbers randomly assigned to an individual at the completion of enrolment into the National Identity Database (NIDB). The NIN is used to tie all records about an individual in the database and is verifiable via the NIMC Verification Service (NVS) portal which is made available to institutions and organisations upon request. Section 27 (1) and (2) of the NIMC Act, 2007, states that transactions including, application for and issuance of an International Passport; opening of individual and/or group bank accounts, all consumer credits; purchase of insurance policies, purchase, transfer and registration of land by any individual; National Health Insurance Scheme, and such transactions that have social security implications, registration of voters, payment of taxes, and pensions, will be done with the NIN.
