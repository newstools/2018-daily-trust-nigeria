The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) which is currently prosecuting some individuals in the last administration in Niger State for tempering with ecological fund allocated to the state has recovered part of the money. A source close to the commission told Daily Trust yesterday that among those who had returned parts of the missing fund were key witnesses in the on-going trial over the matter at the Minna Federal High Court. The former governor of the state Dr Muazu Babaginda Aliyu and a commissioner of environment during the administration , Umar Nasko are standing trial for allegedly laundering the ecological fund to the tune of N2 billion. Our correspondent recalls that a witness in the on-going trial had admitted during the continuation of the hearing recently of refunding some money, leaving an outstanding sum which he promised to return in due course. Our source said so far N57 million had been recovered from five people who were directly involved in the saga.
