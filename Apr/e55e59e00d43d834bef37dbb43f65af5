The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, yesterday declared his intention to contest the July 12, 2018 governorship election in Ekiti, saying he is vying for the post for the second term to conquer poverty and restore dignity of the people. Fayemi, who is the immediate past governor of the state used the rally held in Ado Ekiti, to also dismiss the white paper released by the state government, accusing him of mismanaging state funds. “They have the white paper. We have the red card. Between their white paper and our red card, we will know the one that’s most potent. Enough of assault, enough of insult, enough of bad governance. We are running on our record of an unforgettable four - year administration and on the record of our President who has done well for Nigeria”, he said. The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship hopeful disclosed that his government took a loan of N25bn which was expended on many infrastructural projects, opening up many communities, towns and villages across the 16 local government areas of the state beside several other projects that touched the lives of the people. “I didn’t use the loan to pay salary. I didn’t mismanage or embezzle the loan. The records are there for everyone to see”, he said. He accused Governor Ayodele Fayose of borrowing N54bn to construct “a bridge to nowhere”.
