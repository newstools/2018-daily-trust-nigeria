The Senate yesterday resolved to join the House of Representatives in inviting President Muhammadu Buhari to provide explanations on the spate of killings in parts of the country. The resolution was sequel to a motion by Senator George Akume (APC, Benue) on killings in Benue State. Akume said despite military presence, the killings have continued unabated since January this year. The House of Representatives had on Wednesday passed similar resolution, inviting the President. The suggestion that the president be invited was first mooted by Senator Obinna Ogba (PDP, Ebonyi) when he said the Senate should join the Reps. When the question was raised by Senate President Bukola Saraki, majority of senators supported the resolution. Saraki is to meet with Speaker Yakubu Dogara to fix date on the appearance of the President.
