Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose has said Nigeria is drifting towards a state of anarchy, calling on the international community to rescue the country from turning into a war zone where mass killings will become usual. Fayose who was reacting to the killing of 17 worshippers and two Catholic priests in Benue State as well as President Muhammadu Buhari’s withdrawal of $496 million from the Excess Crude Account (ECA) without approval of the National Assembly and the controversial arrest of Senator Dino Melaye, said it was obvious that under the Buhari government, the constitution had been suspended. He said, “If half of the aggressiveness being shown by the Police on the arrest of Senator Dino Melaye is shown on the killings by herdsmen across the North Central states and other parts of the country, the rampaging killer herdsmen that are even killing policemen would have been brought under control.” The Special Assistant to the governor on Public Communications and New Media, Lere Olayinka, said in a statement Tuesday night that it was curious that Father Joseph Gor, one of the Catholic priests murdered in Benue State, raised alarm on January 3, 2018, through his facebook account on the occupation of Mbalom community by herdsmen, yet the priest was allowed to be killed! On the withdrawal of $496 million from the Excess Crude Account, Governor Fayose said, “One day, this federal government will even stop releasing statutory allocations to states and local councils. They are behaving as if the constitution of the country is already suspended.”
