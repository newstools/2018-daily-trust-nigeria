The Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Yusuf Abdullahi Ata, has explained how he is managing the Gandujiyya and Kwankwasiyya disparity among the lawmakers in the House. Speaking in a programme, Barka da Hantsi, aired by a Kano private FM station, Freedom Radio, Ata said he managed the differences between supporters of the state Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and that of Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso by being fair to all on both sides. Ata said, “Whatever comes to the floor, I make sure that everybody is involved. I always ensure that every member of the House irrespective of which group he belongs to, participates in the affairs of the House. “And because I am treating the lawmakers equally irrespective of their differences, the members of Kwankwasiyya group have never shown disregard to bills that come from the Executive arm of government,” he said. The speaker added that from inception to date, the 8th Assembly had formulated four laws that bordered on improving healthcare service delivery, namely the Kano State Health Trust Fund 2017, Kano State Private Institutions Law, Kano State Contributory Health Insurance Law and Kano State Law on the two Ultra Modern hospitals: Muhammadu Buhari Specialist Hospital Giginyu and Paediatrics Hospital Zoo road.
