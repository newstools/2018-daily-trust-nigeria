The Jama’atu Izalatil Bid’ah Wa’iqamatis Sunnah (JIBWIS), with its headquarters in Jos, yesterday criticised a former minister of defence Lt. Gen. T.Y. Danjuma (rtd) over his comment against the Military and for Nigerians to defend themselves. National Chairman of JIBWIS Ulama’u Council, Sheikh Muhammadu Sani Yahaya Jingir made the criticism yesterday in Abuja at the Annual Islamic Convention and appeal fund launch of the organisation. “It is not advisable for an elder statesman, who was a former defence minister and chief of Army Staff to be calling on youths, who were graduating from a university to take up arms against the nation’s military and organised Federal Government as if we don’t have a government. He should be called to order,” Jingir said. He also urged Nigerians to be law abiding and see themselves as each other’s brother’s keepers. President Muhammadu Buhari who was represented by the FCT Minister, Mallam Mohammed Musa Bello commended JIBWIS for their efforts at poverty alleviation, health care activities and being at the forefront of moral rectitude in the society. The Zamfara, Sokoto and Bauchi state governors among others were represented by their respective commissioners of Religious Affairs. Chairman of the FCT Ulama’u Council, Mallam Ibrahim Muhammad Duiguri  said funds realised at the event would be utilised on the construction of conference hall, library and operational vehicles among others.
