The move to recall Senator Dino Melaye representing Kogi West Senatorial District at the National Assembly has failed as the Saturday's signature verification exercise failed to meet the constitutional requirement to proceed with the exercise. 

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the results released at the INEC office, Lokoja, in the early hours of Sunday said only 5.34% signatures of the petitioners was verified as against the 50% plus 1 as required by the Electoral Act. According to the result announced in Lokoja by INEC's Resident Electoral Commissioner in charge of Benue State,  Professor Ukertor Gabriel Moti, said total numbers of registered voters in Kogi West was 351, 140. The Commissioner added that the total number of petitioners' signatures collated for recall was 189, 870, while only 20, 868 signatory were present for accreditation. He however said only 18,743 number of the signatures were verified at the end of the exercise. 

According to the INEC Commissioner, the constitutional requirements and percentage to effect the recall of Senator was not met, hence, the Commission could not go to the next stage which is referendum. In making his declaration, Prof Moti said: "I hereby affirm that the information on verification of signatures to the petition for the recall of Senator Dino Melaye of Kogi West Senatorial District has taken place on this date April 28, 2018 and that the verified signatures is 5.34% of the total number of registered voters in the constituency and has therefore not satisfied the requirements the law for a referendum".
