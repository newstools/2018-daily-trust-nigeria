An FCT High Court in Maitama, Abuja has granted exparte order restraining the police and the State Security Service (SSS) from arresting Senator Ovie Omo-Agege (APC, Delta). Omo-Agege in the motion exparte filed by his counsel, Aliyu Umar (SAN), joined the Attorney General of the Federation, the Inspector General of Police, the Commissioner of Police FCT Command and the Director General of the SSS as respondents. He prayed the court for an interim injunction restraining the respondents and their agents from arresting and/or detaining him pending the hearing and determination of a motion on notice he filed. He also asked for an interim injunction restraining the respondents and their agents “from any attempt or threat to violate” his “fundamental right to personal liberty and right to freedom of movement pending the determination of the motion on notice.” He further asked the court to restrain the respondents from taking any further steps detrimental to his fundamental rights in connection with the facts stated in the motion on notice. The Chief Judge of the FCT High Court, Justice Ishaq Bello granted all the prayers sought in the motion exparte and assigned the motion on notice to Justice Usman Musale’s court in Jabi. Daily Trust reports that police quizzed Omo-Agege on Wednesday after thugs suspected to have entered the Senate building with him took the Senate Mace and disappeared. The Senate, last week, suspended Omo-Agege for 90 days based on findings of its Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions over the Senator’s comments on the amendment of Electoral Act, 2010. He thereafter sued the Senate in a bid to stop his suspension.
