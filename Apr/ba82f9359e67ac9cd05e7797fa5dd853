No fewer than 15 people were feared dead and 55 others injured in a Sunday night attack by Boko Haram insurgents at Bale community in the outskirts of Maiduguri. Competent security sources told NAN that a number of insurgents attacked Bale-Shuwa and Bale-Kura communities near Maiduguri in an attempt to infiltrate the town at 8: 00 pm. The source disclosed that the insurgents parked their vehicles few meters away from a security checkpoint and sneaked into the community. The source added that the security operatives engaged in fierce gun battle with the insurgents who detonated Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and shot sporadically. However, the  Commander of the Theatre Command of Operation Lafiya Dole, Maj-Gen. Rogers  Nicholas, denied any death on the side of his soldiers or civilians  in the attack. Reacting to NAN inquiry in a text message, he said however that some of the Boko Haram insurgents were killed. “There was an attack which was repelled and some Boko Haram insurgents were killed by gallant soldiers. However,  Boko Haram came with suicide bombers who detonated their vests while running from the troops fire in a nearby community and that led to 14 civilians being injured from the blasts,” Nicholas said.  (NAN)
