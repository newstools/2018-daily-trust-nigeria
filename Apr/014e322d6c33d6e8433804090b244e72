A former military governor of Plateau State during the regime of former military President Ibrahim Babangida, retired Major-General Aliyu Adu Umar Kama, has urged those trying to contest against President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019 to wait till 2023. Apparently referring to a former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, former Jigawa State governor Sule Lamido and a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Kingsley Moghalu among others, Kama said it would be unwise for anyone irrespective of their inclinations to want to contest against President Buhari next year. He was speaking Saturday in Abuja at the Hoba community grand reception for the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Gida Mustapha, by the Hoba elders council. According to the former Milad, the Hoba people of Adamawa State are grateful to President Buhari for appointing two sons of the community as SGF successively and pledged continuous support for the Buhari administration. Responding, SGF Mustapha pledged to conduct himself creditably in office and that he would work hard to ensure that at the end of service, his people would be proud of him.
