The management of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has debunked a report by a national daily which claimed that the agency has introduced Sharia practice in the Federal Capital Territory orientation camp. In a statement signed by its Director of Public Relations, Adenike Adeyemi, the agency said there is nothing like ‘Introduction of Sharia Practice in any NYSC Orientation Camp’ including the FCT Camp. According to the statement, the publication (not Daily Trust) claimed that the NYSC scheme in FCT camp Kubwa has introduced Sharia practice including the banning of sales of alcoholic drinks and non-socialization of male and female corps members. The agency claimed this is untrue. The statement noted that the scheme runs a prototype policy in all NYSC Orientation Camps nationwide hence the camps are coordinated with a uniform timetable as well as freedom of worship for both Muslim and Christian corps members. On the issue of restriction of socialization of male and female corps members, the statement added that the report negates the whole essence of the scheme as it was not possible for any camp management to stop the social integration of corps members in an orientation camp. It emphasized that corps members were grouped into platoons which comprises of both male and female who carry out all camp activities together.
