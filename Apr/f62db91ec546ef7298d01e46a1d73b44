Turkey and Russia will collaborate to establish a hospital in Syria’s Tel Abyad to treat those escaping Eastern Ghouta, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday alongside his Russian and Iranian counterparts - Vladimir Putin and Hassan Rouhani - after a summit on Syria, Erdogan said Turkish and Russian armed forces would coordinate to build the medical facility. Turkey, Russia and Iran also said they were committed to achieving a “lasting ceasefire” in Syria, in a joint statement issued following the meeting in the Turkish capital of Ankara. The three countries reaffirmed their commitment to cooperating for “the achievement of a lasting ceasefire between the conflicting parties”, the statement said.
