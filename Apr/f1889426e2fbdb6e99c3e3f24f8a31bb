Nigeria’s Chairman of the Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts, Senator Shehu Sani has reacted to different reactions trailing the sef-defense comments made by a former Minister of Defence, Theophilus Danjuma, the Emir of Birnin Gwari, Malam Zubairu Jibril Mai Gwari II, and the Emir of Zamfara by the Federal Government. Sani in a tweet on Monday said,"When Danjuma spoke on self defense,you threw spears at him;When the 2 Emirs spoke on self defense,you threw flowers at them.Its either you commend them both or condemn them both. "You can’t give one a slap and the other a pat when both told us how naked we live".  He further stated that the calling for self-defense by the two emirs is a response to the increasing insecurity in their respective domains. "The two Emirs from Zamfara and Birnin Gwari who talked about self defense are expressing their views on the helpless situation their people found themselves. "Their people are killed or kidnapped everyday.Their people live in perpetual fear & daily funerals",he said.
