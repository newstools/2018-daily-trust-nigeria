Imo State Governor, Chief Rochas Okorocha has decried the attitude of his deputy, Prince Eze Madumere, saying he never imagined that he would betray him. Okorocha had fallen out with Madumere following the governor’s refusal to endorse him as his successor in the 2019 election and the subsequent declaration of Madumere to contest the governorship election with or without the governor’s consent or backing. Okorocha, speaking in Owerri, said that he had been with his deputy as his most trusted lieutenant for the past 25 years, adding that such betrayal by his once loyal deputy was the unkindest cut of all. According to him, he had initially penciled down some people, including his deputy as his successor, but embarked on the process of selection and elimination based on some parameters, and finally chose his Chief of Staff, Mazi Uche Nwosu, his son-in-law, as his successor.
