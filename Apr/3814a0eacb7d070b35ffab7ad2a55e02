President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday disclosed that negotiations between the federal government and Boko Haram for the release of the remaining abducted Chibok schoolgirls had suffered unexpected setbacks. He said this was mainly due to lack of agreement among the girls’ abductors whose internal differences, he explained, had led to divergent voices regarding the outcome of the negotiations. Buhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity Malam Garba Shehu, said he joined the Borno State government,  parents of the girls and Nigerians in commemorating the fourth anniversary of the sad incident. Buhari, however, assured parents of the schoolgirls that their daughters would never be forgotten or abandoned. “We know that this is not the news parents want to hear after four whole years of waiting, but we want to be as honest as possible with you. However, this government is not relenting. We will continue to persist, and the parents should please not give up. Don’t give up hope of seeing our daughters back home again. Don’t imagine for a moment that we have forgotten about our daughters or that we consider their freedom a lost course,’’ the president said. Buhari urged the parents to keep their hopes alive on the return of their daughters, saying the recovery of more than 100 of the girls through the government’s determined effort should give confidence. He asked the parents to be expectant of more good news in due course. He assured that as long as he remained the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, the Chibok girls would never be forgotten, and all will be done to reunite them with their families.
