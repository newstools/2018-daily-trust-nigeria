A presidential aspirant for the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Comrade John Oladele Nihi on Wednesday expressed his support for President Muhammadu Buhari's declaration to run for a second term in 2019.

Nihi, who is currently the Kogi State chairman of the NYCN, praised President Buhari for the successes he has achieved so far in the areas of security, anti-corruption fight, economy and social welfare.

He however, urged the president to ensure total independence for INEC in the discharge of its duties so it can deliver free, fair and credible election come 2019.  

Nihi also appealed to the president to, as a matter of importance assent to the "Not Too Young To Run Bill" to give room for more young people to participate in the electoral processes. 

"Democracy is all about inclusion and collective bargaining, it will take the involvement of all to guarantee a sustainable democracy. 

"Therefore, we are using this medium to call on our President to append his signature to the all important "Not Too Young To Run Bill" which will be transmitted to him. 

"This will give room for more people to participate in the democratic process, and it also creates a sense of belonging in the progressive and sustainable Nigeria that Mr President is building", he said. 

On the Peace Corp Bill, Comrade Nihi pleaded with the president to reconsider his decision and see what can be done in order for the bill to get his assent.

"The Peace Corps Bill is one which, when signed into law possesses the capacity to accommodate thousands of the unemployed youths in the country. 

"The Corps will also complement the efforts of other security agencies in the fight against crime and insecurity which the Buhari government is very serious about", Nihi said. 

Nihi called on the Nigerian youths to remain steadfast and avoid being used as tools to propagate disunity and violence in the build up to the 2019 elections.
