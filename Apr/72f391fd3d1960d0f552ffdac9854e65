A 53-year-old landlady, Rita Olukanmi, on Wednesday appeared in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing property worth N1.4 million belonging to her tenant. The accused, who resides at No. 19, Oduduwa St., Aboru, Lagos, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, housebreaking and stealing. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Prosecutor, Insp. Victor Eruada, told the court that the accused committed the offences with others at large on Jan. 7, at the above address.

Eruada, who also told the court that the accused stole a wedding album and home theatre, said the value of all the property Olukanmi stole was N1.4 million. “Jacob, who found the stolen items in his landlady’s apartment, reported the case at the station and the accused was immediately apprehended.” The offences contravened Sections 411, 287 and 307 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The Magistrate, Mrs Dan Oni, granted the accused bail in the sum of N250, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She adjourned the case until May 7, for mention.
