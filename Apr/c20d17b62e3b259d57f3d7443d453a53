A lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Prof. Richard Akindele, has been enmeshed in a sex scandal for allegedly demanding for five rounds of sex before a particular female student could pass his course. According to an audio recording between the student and the lecturer, the Professor said he would have sex with the lady five times if she does not want to fail the course but the lady rejected the offer on the basis that the demand was too high. Efforts to get the unidentified female student was not successful and the Professor kept sealed lips but those who could recognize his voice confirmed that the man speaking in the audio recording was Prof. Akindele. Meanwhile, the management of the university has commenced investigation on the matter with assurance that whoever that is liable would be sanctioned appropriately. The Public Relation Officer of the University, Mr Abiodun Olanrewaju told Daily Trust that the management of OAU was aware of the audio recording in circulation and that investigation has commenced on it. According to him, "OAU does not encourage or tolerate sexual harassment. We are aware of the audio recording of a conversation between a man and a lady in which the lady mentioned a particular name." "We are trying to unravel the authenticity of that audio as it was linked to OAU. The moment we established the authenticity of that audio, the authority of OAU will not spear whoever that is liable. The management will apply appropriate sanction."
