The striking health workers in the country have blamed their predicament on the country’s medical doctors who they say often find themselves at the helm of the nation’s health institutions only to abuse the privilege. The National President of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM), Abdrafiu Alani Adeniji, who made the assertion at a news conference in Abeokuta at the weekend, said the strike by the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) would continue despite threats by government. Last week, JOHESU which comprises the NANNM, the Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria (MHWUN), Senior Staff Association of Universities, Teaching Hospitals, Research institutes and Associated Institutions (SSAUTHRIAI), Nigeria Union of Allied Health Professionals (NUAHP) and the Non Academics Staff Union of Education and Associated Institutions (NASU) commenced an indefinite strike. Adeniji who charged that medical doctors had become politicians and had resorted to trade with the fortune of the health sector, said it was sad that as JOSESU had been on strike, doctors had been deceiving patients that they could handle patients’ problems without JOHESU members, thereby compounding the problems of the patients rather than discharging them to seek help in hospitals not affected by the strike. “They have done this wickedly and against the ethics and international best practices to assume jack of all trades and master of none,” Adeneji said.
