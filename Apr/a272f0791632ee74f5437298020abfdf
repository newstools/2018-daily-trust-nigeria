The Association of Commonwealth Natural Herbal Medicine Practitioners (ACNHMP) has called on the federal government to make special provisions for the promotion of herbal medicine in the country’s annual budget. ACNHMP’s President, Alhaji Muhammed Salihu Danmasani, who made the request in Abuja, said the provision would stimulate herbal medicine production in the country. The practitioners call is coming five months after President Muhammadu Buhari presented the budget to the National Assembly. He said the provision should be included in the Federal Ministry of Health’s budget, adding that they can compete favourably with Indian herbal medicines if given the needed resources. “Herbal medicine practitioners in other climes enjoy tremendous government support and we also desire the same treatment from our home government and there is no better time for such gesture than now,” he said.
