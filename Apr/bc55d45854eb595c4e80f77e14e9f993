The Director General, National Agency for the Control of Aids (NACA), Dr Sani Aliyu has said HIV/AIDS should be integrated into the healthcare service and not treated as separate disease. Dr Sani who made this known during an interview said, funding for HIV/AIDS should not be separate, but be inculcated into the healthcare budget. “If we still have separate funding, management, and medical expert handling the issue of the disease in our hospitals across the country in the next few years then, we have failed. Persons living with the diseases should be able to access treatment from any doctor in any hospitals. When a doctor is attending to diabetes patients, he can also attend to HIV patients.” He added that NACA hopes to launch a national treatment forum towards the end of the year, where people would be able to access care. Dr Sani also said NACA was pushing to make HIV drugs part of essential drugs in the country.
