Hundreds of placard-carrying Christians of various denominations on Sunday stormed the streets in Ado Ekiti, to protest incessant killing of fellow christians in the Middle Belt of  Benue and North Eastern part of the country.

The protesters staged the protest under the aigies of Christian Association of Nigeria, (CAN) under heavy security, provided by a joint patrol of men of the police and Civil Defence Corps. 

They lamented that the current trend might lead to another civil war and total collapse of the country if not curtailed in record time.

Most churches visited by our correspondent witnessed low turn-out of worshippers as many abandoned services to take part in the protest which began at about 2pm.

Led by the state Chairman of CAN, Rev. Joshua Orikogbe and other top church leaders, christian faithfuls in all the 16 local government areas of the state, the association called on President Muhammadu Buhari to act swiftly by stopping the menace and bring the cuprits to book. 

The protesters marched from CAN headquarters along Adebayo/ Opopogbooro area of the state capital to the popular Adekunle Fajuyi Memorial Park, before ending it at the Government House where they sent a letter to the president through Governor Ayo Fayose.

The CAN chairman said: “We are for peace in  Nigeria but it is like we are being pushed to the wall by these wanton killings of christians and clerics.

"To us in Ekiti CAN, the only way to sustain peace is for the government of the day at the federal level to abandon politics for sometime and focus the needed attention on security and safety of lives", he said.
