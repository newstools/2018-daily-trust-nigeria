Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has condemned the declaration of Pesident Muhammadu Buhari for second term as unpopular, unpleasant and unpalatable to the vast majority of Nigerians.

In a series of tweets after the President declares his intention to run for a second term, Omokri said the Pesident's chances of being re-elected is slim.

"The man knew that his 2nd term declaration is unpopular, unpleasant and unpalatable to the vast majority of Nigerians which is why he ran away to London as soon as he announced the news," he said.

"Since Buhari hasn’t initiated and completed even one project as #BuhariChallenge proves, I urge him to use 2019 election to redeem himself. 

"Initiate and complete a free election and give Nigerians the opportunity to fulfill their desire to retire you from politics next February," he added. The man knew that his 2nd term declaration is unpopular, unpleasant and unpalatable to the vast majority of Nigerians which is why he ran away to London as soon as he announced the news. One would have thought he is contesting for @Theresa_May’s job the way he dashes to the UK. Since Buhari hasn’t initiated and completed even one project as #BuhariChallenge proves, I urge him to use 2019 election to redeem himself. Initiate and complete a free election and give Nigerians the opportunity to fulfill their desire to retire you from politics next February!

A man whose supporters can't declare one thing he has initiated and completed has declared us all fools by this 2nd term declaration.
