The Federal Government of Nigeria, in collaboration with the ECOWAS Commission, will host a sub-regional ministerial meeting to come up with solutions to the challenges posed by the recurrent conflicts between herders and farmers in the region.

The Minister of Interior, Abdulrahman Dambazau, disclosed this in Abuja ahead of the meeting which will involve the countries in the ECOWAS sub-region. 

In a statement signed by Hassan Dodo, the Director of Press and Public Relations at the ministry, the minister stated that the meeting would take place on Thursday, 26th April, 2018 at ECOWAS Commission, Abuja, and would be preceded by Governmental Experts Meeting from 24th to 25th April, 2018.

Dambazau explained that the meeting was informed by the need to adopt a coordinated regional approach in addressing the escalation of cases of conflicts between herders and farmers, and the attendant killings, disruption of socio-economic activities, and displacement of citizens in almost all the countries in the region.

According to the Minister, each ECOWAS member state would be represented by two delegates comprising the Ministers in charge of internal security, and Agriculture.

He said President Muhammadu Buhari will declare the conference open on 26th April, 2018.
