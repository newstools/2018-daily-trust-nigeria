The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to stop the increasing attacks and killing of innocent people in Benue State before it degenerates into a national crisis. Secondus in a statement on Wednesday, by his spokesman, Ike Abonyi, said ‎the continued bloodletting in Benue and other parts of the country raised a lot of concerns on the future of the nation. "From whichever angle you are witnessing what is happening in this country, one thing is agreeable that this country is sliding dangerously. "Nigerians and the global community have continued to watch as all the tenets of democracy are being eroded and giving way to dictatorial tendencies. "I find it unexplainable that some group of gunmen should hold a state to ransom since January killing and maiming citizens and destroying their houses and the security operatives appear helpless. “Where are the military operatives that carried out Python and Crocodile dances in South East and South South regions respectively lately brandishing their might  to less dangerous citizens and who have been unable to tackle the Benue killings. “How can anybody expect Benue State for instance, to contribute its own share of the $1b security votes when the nation security architecture is not designed to protect their people?" Secondus queried.
