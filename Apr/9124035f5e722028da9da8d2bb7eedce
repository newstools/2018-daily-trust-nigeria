Over 100 youths aspiring for various political offices ahead of 2019 elections, yesterday, converged in Kaduna to brainstorm on how to bring the youths into Nigerian politics. Speaking at a four-day training workshop organised by Youngsters Foundation, with support from the FORD Foundation, West Africa, the youths, drawn from states in the North West, said if Nigeria’s founding fathers, most of who were in their 20s and 30s at the time, could lead the country to independence, then the youths of today had all it took to lead the affairs of the country come 2019. They expressed optimism that Nigerians would afford them the opportunity to put things in proper perspective during the elections year. Commenting on a statement credited to President Muhammadu Buhari that most Nigerian youths were illiterates and lazy, Yasir Albashir, who is aspiring for the House of Representatives from Katsina State, said, “Nigerian youths are doing well in banking and information and communication technology, and if given tools, are ready to get the job done better than the adults.” Also speaking, Barrister Hassana Bashir, who is aspiring for a seat in the Kano State House of Assembly, decried negligence of women and children by policy makers, saying, “As a lawyer, if I can become a legislator, I will be able to effect laws that will benefit our women and children. As we speak, there is no single female lawmaker in the Kano assembly. How can we then have legislation that will favour women and children when they are not represented?” Earlier, the convener, Kingsley Bangwell, told newsmen that the preparatory programme was designed to increase the capacity, participation and space for youths’ emergence in elective positions in the 2019 general elections.
