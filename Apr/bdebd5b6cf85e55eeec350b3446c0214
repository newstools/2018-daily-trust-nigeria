Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier General Suleiman Kazaure has expressed sadness over the death of a female corp member Hilda Eva Amadi in Kwara State Orientation Camp, Yikpata, in Edu Local Government Area of the State.  In a statement signed by the Director, Press and Public Relations department of the Scheme, Mrs Adenike Adeyemi noted that when the Director General visited the camp during his camp tours recently, he said NYSC Management would not undermine the welfare and security of any Corps Member.   Kazaure however ruled out negligence of duty on the part of camp officials.  Amadi gave up the ghost at the General Hospital in Ilorin where she was referred to, by the Medical Consultant at the Camp Clinic after she sustained a leg fracture.  The NYSC boss used the forum to appeal to State Governments towards performing their statutory responsibilities with regards to the provision and maintenance of Orientation Camps across the county.  He urged other Corps Members to be security conscious at all times and avoid night parties which might expose them to danger.  He advised them to acquire relevant skills in order to empower themselves for job creation and not being victims of unemployment.  State Coordinator of the scheme, Mr Remigius Amaefule disclosed that a total of 1,940 Corps Members were sworn-in for the 2018 Batch 'A' Orientation Course.
