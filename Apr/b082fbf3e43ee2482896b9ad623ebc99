Lagos State Police Command said it has arrested some secondary school boys who are leaders of various secret cult gangs operating within the metropolis. Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal said those arrested were mainly members of Aiye, Black axe and Eiye confraternities. Edgal said that the teenage cult gang members were arrested by police detectives attached to the ant-cultism unit. The Lagos police boss said that the Aiye Black Axe capon identified as Dare Oluwadamilare has sent many persons to their early graves in Oworonshoki before fleeing to Ghana in 2014. He said the gangster was arrested last week in a hideout in Oworonshoki, a suburb in Lagos, where he and members of his gang were to attack a member of Eye capon, Joseph Ashubi. He explained that before Ashubi was arrested he had led members of his cult group to launch an attack on a hapless woman in her shop somewhere in Ikorodu, an outskirt of Lagos for yet to be ascertained reason. And while investigation was yet to be concluded on the arrest of the two notorious cultists, operatives attached to Ilupeju Police Division again intercepted some student-cultists who were on a hit mission to another school in Mushin. The Commissioner of Police CP Imohimi Edgal who paraded the suspects before newsmen assured that the Police Command was doing everything within its capacity to ensure that cultism was eliminated in the state. The police boss also warned that he would henceforth send his men after parents whose underage wards were arrested for cultism adding that it was wrong for parents not to keep an eye on the activities of their children in and after schools.
