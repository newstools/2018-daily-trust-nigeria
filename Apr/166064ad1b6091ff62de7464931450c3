The councillor representing Gawu ward in Abaji Area Council, Suleiman Ibrahim, and two other people have been injured following a clash between herders and farmers in Gawu. The two injured residents, identified as Mahmuda Abubakar and Kabiru Suleiman, sustained machete cuts during the violence that occurred Thursday morning. A witness who identified himself as Yahaya, said trouble started after some herdsmen allegedly moved their cattle into the farm of the councillor at about 11:00a.m. and destroyed ridges made on it. Yahaya said the incident provoked some youths that accompanied the councillor to the farm. They alleged that the herders also removed some tubers of yam planted in the farm. “I was also on my farm that day. As they were exchanging words, one of the youths that accompanied the councillor attempted to seize one of the cows and before you know it, one of herdsmen attacked the two men and the councillor,” he said. He said the councillor and two others victims were taken to a clinic in Mawogi village, adding that the intervention of elders and the Ardo Fulani prevented the violence from escalating. When contacted, the Gwagwalada Police Area Commander, ACP Mijinyawa Jahun, confirmed the incident. He said the matter was before the Ona of Abaji, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa who, he added, had directed that all the parties involved appear before him.
