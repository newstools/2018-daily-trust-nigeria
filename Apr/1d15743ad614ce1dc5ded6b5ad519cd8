The Philippines has demanded an explanation for Kuwait’s decision to expel its ambassador amid a dispute over the treatment of domestic workers. The two nations have been attempting to resolve the dispute since February, when the body of a murdered Filipina maid was discovered in Kuwait. But last week videos emerged showing embassy staff “rescuing” Filipinos allegedly abused by their employers. Kuwait condemned the “violation of its laws” and told the ambassador to leave. Four Filipinos hired by the embassy were also arrested by Kuwaiti police and arrest warrants issued against three diplomatic personnel, according to the Philippines. On Thursday, the Philippine foreign ministry said it had served a diplomatic note to the Kuwaiti embassy in Manila “conveying its strong surprise and great displeasure” at the expulsion of Mr Villa and the detention of the four Filipinos hired by the embassy.
