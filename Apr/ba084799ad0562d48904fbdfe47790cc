The Kwankwasiyya Foundation of former Kano state governor, Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has empowered one hundred women with N10,000 each to make them self reliant in Yobe state.  Dr Surajo Kwankwaso, who represents the former governor, said the gesture was part of theIr nation-wide  campaign to reduce poverty among women.  He said the initiative was building on the successes recorded on women empowerment during the reign of Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso in Kano state.  "At that time, we selected 100 vulnerable women from each of the 44 local government  areas and placed them on monthly pay of N10,000 each. It was a success story because they all proved to be very productive" he said.  Kwankwaso's said the beneficiaries were carefully selected base on vulnerability from the seventeen local government areas of the state.  He noted that the forum had also supported youths football clubs across Yobe with Jerseys, balls and shoes to improve their skills and harvest young talents that secure jobs in Nigeria and abroad.  He called on the beneficiaries to utilize the money as capital for profit and improving the economy of the society.
