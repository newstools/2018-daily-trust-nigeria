The Nigerian Shippers’ Council has entered into partnership with the Oyo State Government for the development of Inland Dry Port (IDP) and Truck Transit Park (TTP) in   conjunction with some Chinese investors in the state. The partnership arrangement was unfolded when   the Executive Secretary/CEO of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) Mr. Hassan Bello, paid a courtesy visit to the Oyo State Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, at his office in Ibadan. Bello  said that  collaborating with the state government on the establishment of dry ports will bring about development, stressing that the state is  critical to the development of transportation in view of  its strategic location. According to him, since 2006, the federal government had taken a decision to establish Inland Dry Ports in the six geo-political zones of the country, of which Oyo State is one. The ES/CEO said that the establishment of IDP and TTP in the state will provide job opportunities and create wealth for the state. Bello also said  the ongoing rail project being championed by the Ministry of Transport will be a big boost, to help decongest traffic, and facilitate easy movement of  goods from Lagos ports to different locations. He disclosed that the proposed TTP alone would gulp N4.8 billion through the Public Private Partnership (PPP), adding that the facilities will include shopping malls, hotels, motels, worship centre, commercial banks, restaurants, among others. Bello noted that a Memorandum of Understanding was signed recently with the Chinese investors for the Ibadan Dry Port project. In his address, Governor Ajimobi assured the NSC of the support of the administration and called on the council to hasten the paperwork required for the project to begin.
