Supporters of Turkey’s main opposition party have staged sit-in demonstrations across the country to protest against the state of emergency, a move criticised by the government. The demonstrations held on Monday, reportedly in all of Turkey’s 81 provinces, were organised as the government prepares this week to extend the state of emergency for the seventh time. Turkey declared the state of emergency on July 20, 2016, and has extended it regularly after a coup attempt in July 2016.
