The High Court sitting in Lafia, Nasarawa State presided over by Justice James Abundega, yesterday sentences a Police Sergeant Vincent Manu to death for unlawfully killing a businessman, late Stephen Anakwe, and labeled him an armed robber. Sergeant Manu was arraigned alongside five other police officers, Inspector Danladi Lenkem and Inspector Edula Ateku who died in the process of the trial, corporals Samson Magga and Musa Audu as well as Christopher Maikasuwa on a charge of criminal conspiracy to kill the deceased while they were on patrol. The offence was committed on February 13, 2012 when the deceased, who resides in Jos, travelled to Abuja where he socialized at a bar in New Nyanya, Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. Justice Abundega, who found Sergeant Manu who carried out the shooting guilty of murder, said the prosecution was able to prove by cogent circumstantial evidence that the convict intentionally killed the deceased. In his judgment, the judge rejected the defendant plea of self-defence, saying that based on the evidence before him, that was not plausible. He, however, absolved the other police officers of any wrongdoing, and discharged and acquitted them.
