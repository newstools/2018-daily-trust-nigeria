The President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Alhaji Abdulwaheed Odusile, says the `Democracy Dividend Media Tour’ embarked on by the union is aimed at improving service delivery to Nigerians. Odusile stated this yesterday in Gusau, Zamfara State, at the commencement of the media tour which would be carried out throughout the country. “As watchdogs and in exercising our constitutional responsibilities, journalists are supposed to hold government accountable and to ensure that people’s expectations are met,’’ the NUJ president said. He said that although the visitation was not aimed at awarding performance marks on the states, the team would look into the revenue generation base of a state vis-a-vis development effort of state governments. The NUJ president said, “Sometimes, some of these foreign media give negative reports and representation of our country. This tour will give participating journalists who have been drawn from various media outfits and platforms the opportunity to make on-the-spot analysis of the states,’’ Odusile said, assuring that reports that would come from the tour would be fair and objective. In his response, the state Commissioner of Information, Alhaji Sanda Kwatarkwashi, said, “Only non-performing states will run away from this laudable initiative by the NUJ. As we take you round, you will see that the state government under Gov. Abdulaziz Yari has achieved a lot in the last seven years.” The commissioner thanked the union for choosing the state as a start-off point of the tour. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the media tour, which was initiated by the National Secretariat of the NUJ, would involve over 40 journalists. The journalists are to look and report government performances across the country. (NAN)
