Imo State Governor and Chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s declaration for second term will silence the voices of the opposition. Gov. Okorocha said the declaration could be adjudged as a patriotic response to the clarion call of Nigerians of goodwill for him to lead the country for another four years. Okorocha, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, said President Buhari going for a second tenure would also go a long way to take care of what he described as the “idiosyncrasies of certain elements in the system.” Okorocha said the president had done well to deserve a second tenure and remarked that those who had wanted to blackmail him out of going for another term should now find other meaningful things to keep themselves busy. He expressed optimism that the president would largely garner more votes in 2019 than he did in 2015, saying most Nigerians, including people of the South East, had seen that he meant well for the nation. The governor said the APC had no apology to make because it had done wonderfully well considering the magnitude of the rot it met on ground in 2015; and noted that the antenna of the opposition in the country would finally be lowered when campaigns begin.
