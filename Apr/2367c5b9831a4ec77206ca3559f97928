Special courts in Zimbabwe have been set up around the country to deal with cases of political violence and intimidation ahead of elections which are due in July, the police say. These are the first polls since Robert Mugabe was forced to step down as president last November. Mr Mugabeâ€™s former ally, Emmerson Mnangagwa - the current president - has pledged to hold a peaceful, fair vote. Previous elections were marred by violence as the police and military were used to intimidate the opposition and keep Mr Mugabe in power.
