The emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may be moved forward to comply with the provisions of the party’s constitution. On Wednesday, the APC National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, said the party’s emergency NEC meeting would hold on Monday, April 9 to take final position on the controversial tenure elongation saga. But Monday’s meeting will contravene the provisions of the APC constitution that states that at least seven days’ notice should be given to members to attend such meeting. Article 25 (B) (i) states that the National Executive Committee NEC shall meet every quarter and or at any time decided by the National Chairman or at the request made in writing by at least two-third of the members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) provided that not less than fourteen (14) days notice is given for the meeting to be summoned. However,  Article 25 B (ii) states that “Without prejudice to Article 25 (B) (i) of this Constitution, the National Working Committee may summon an emergency National Executive Committee meeting at any time, provided that at least seven (7) days notice of the meeting shall be given to all those entitled to attend. Daily Trust made efforts to confirm from Oyegun whether the NEC meeting would go ahead as scheduled in view of the potential constitutional breach. He did not pick the calls. The phone line of the APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Bolaji Abdullahi, was busy when our correspondents put calls to him last night. Monday’s NEC meeting is expected to be used to endorse the demand for congresses and convention and announce dates for the exercise.
