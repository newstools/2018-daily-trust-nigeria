Sierra Leone’s opposition candidate, Julius Maada Bio, has rushed to take his presidential oath in a hotel after winning the run-off election. Mr Maada Bio is a former military ruler who briefly ruled the country in 1996. He narrowly beat ruling party candidate Samura Kamara, who has alleged irregularities and says he will challenge the outcome in court. Mr Maada Bio was sworn in on Wednesday, less than two hours after being declared the winner of Saturday’s vote. Under Sierra Leone’s constitution, the presidential vote winner must be sworn in on the same day as he is declared the victor. In a televised address, Mr Kamara said: “We dispute the results and we will take legal action to correct them.” He also urged his supporters to stay calm.
