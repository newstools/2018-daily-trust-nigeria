The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and some Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have stated their readiness to partner with the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) in ensuring better lives for residents. The groups made this known during a roundtable discussion with AMAC Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu Candido, on Tuesday. An official of UNESCO, Steven Onyekwere, who is also the National Programme Officer of the agency on Revitalising Adult and Youth Literacy in Nigeria, said the doors of UNESCO are always open to the council. He said the organisation is willing to assist the council with technical support in its area of competencies which are education, social and human sciences, culture and communication and information. He said, “If the council comes up with a proposal that is relevant to the organisation’s mandate, UNESCO will give its technical expertise and support because we have global network.” Also, the programme officer, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Muhammad Murtala, said the group would sensitise residents on the need to pay taxes and demand accountability from government. He said the residents needed to pay while the government also needed to provide social amenities with the revenues generated. “If the government is more responsive in providing amenities, people will be more willing to pay taxes. We can sensitise people in the formal sector to pay their taxes so that government can provide amenities,” he added. In his remarks, Candido urged the CSOs to preach unity. He said the area council must not be seen as an indigenous council but a council for all Nigerians. “See this area council as yours then you can give it the needed support. The approach is to see the council as a more united council,” he said. While commending the CSOs, he said he looked forward to having a richer engagement with them in the nearest future.
