Fifteen people have been killed in a communal clash between Bassa and Egbura ethnic groups in Umaisha town, Toto local government area of Nasarawa State. Daily Trust gathered that the two parties recently clashed following an age-long chieftaincy dispute in the town which is home to the two ethnic nationalities. A witness, Abdullahi Haruna, told Daily Trust that the Bassa attackers started with sporadic gunshots late evening on Monday and invaded the town yesterday in the early hours around 5am attacking people. While Abdullahi put the casualty at two, another source who spoke on phone with Daily Trust last night, said the figure had risen to at least 15. The Nasarawa State Police  Public Relations Officer DSP Idrisu Kennedy, confirmed the clash but faulted the casualty figures “We don’t have report of casualties in the clashes but the attackers touched houses and vehicles during the attack,” the PPRO said. Kennedy said that the command had arrested two people who were suspected to be members of the team that lunched the attack in Umaisha, adding, “Security men repelled the attackers and two people were arrested, seven double barrel guns were recovered from the suspects.”
