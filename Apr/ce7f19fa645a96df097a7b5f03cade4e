At least 20 people attending a wedding party in northern Yemen, including the bride, are reported to have been killed in an air strike. Medics and residents said more than 30 others were also injured in the attack late on Sunday in Bani Qais district. The rebel Houthi movement blamed the raid on a Saudi-led coalition that is supporting Yemen’s government in the country’s three-year civil war. A coalition spokesman said the reports would be “fully investigated”. The coalition insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. The Houthis’ Al-Masirah TV reported that warplanes had carried out two raids on the wedding party in the rebel-held village of al-Raqa, which is about 90km (55 miles) north-west of the capital Sanaa. The channel put the death toll at 33 and broadcast video footage purportedly from the scene that showed a young boy lying next to the body of a man, screaming and crying as rescuers try to help him.
