The New Nigeria Development Company, NNDC, has recorded a 17 percent decrease in its operating income falling from N898.56 million in 2017 to 747.11 million in the current year. Chairman of the board of the NNDC, Alhaji Bashir Mohammed Dalhatu in his statement at the occasion of the 49th annual general meeting of the company which held in Kaduna Friday, attributed the decrease to lower dividend income on investments. He said an operating profit tax before tax of N138.25 million was achieved against N167.79 million in the previous year representing 18 percent decrease while the company’s net asset stood at N9.19 billion as against N9.41 billion in the corresponding year representing 2.2 percent decrease. He said the company has however been able to perform its social responsibility by supporting the development of quality manpower for the north and the country in general. The chairman said the company has also been able to commence the development of a medium density housing estate which is almost at the point of completion. He said as the economy has now moved out of recession, the company is optimistic about the next financial year as it is anticipated that the various policies of government would start having positive impact on the business environment. “Furthermore, we shall continue to pursue vigorously the various initiatives that the company has put in motion, while taking advantage of new business opportunities with a view to improving the company’s earnings,” he said.
