US President Donald Trump told Russia in an early morning tweet to prepare for “nice and new and ‘smart!’” missile attacks in Syria after an alleged gas attack on the last rebel stronghold in the country. The tweet came after the Russian ambassador to Lebanon said in an interview on Tuesday with Hezbollah-owned al-Manar TV that “if there is a US missile attack, we - in line with both Putin and Russia’s chief of staff’s remarks - will shoot down US rockets and even the sources that launched the missiles”.
