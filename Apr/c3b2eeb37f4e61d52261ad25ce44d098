Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the contractor handling the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail project, CCECC, should begin laying the rail tracks this month, several months after the original scheduled time. The Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, had in March 2018 during his monthly inspection of the construction site and the meeting of the Project Steering Committee with the contractor handling the project, China Civil Engineering and Construction Company (CCECC), at Papalanto in Ogun State, told journalists that the tracks laying must commence April 2018. With possible commencement of the laying of tracks for the project, Mr. Amaechi expressed confidence that the project will be delivered by December 2018 - within the compressed time. Speaking further, the minister said his earlier doubt about delivering the project in December, 2018 was fading, noting that the speed of work on the project by CCECC had greatly increased compared to last year when he gave the revised completion date. “I am very impressed, the speed has increased. The doubt I had before on whether we could achieve this project by the end of the year appears to be clearing,” Amaechi said. He told the contactor to work day and night to complete the work. Thus, the night schedule scope of work got introduced by CCECC when the contract completion time was compressed from about three years to one and half years. The project, was originally billed to be completed in May, 2020, but was reversed to March 31, 2019 based on pressures from the Federal Government. The Minster of Transportation, Amaechi further reduced the completion date to December 2018 and told CCECC to deliver without fail, an order by which the contractor is almost being stretched beyond its limit.
