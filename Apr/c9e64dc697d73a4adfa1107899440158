The United Progressives Congress (UPP) has urged the Police and the Department of State Services (DSS) to track down those who bombed the home of the President General of Ohanaeze, Chief Nnia Nwodo. 

The party in a statement Sunday night by its ‎National Chairman, Chief Chekwas Okorie described the act as devilish and barbaric.

"It is with shock and anger that we received the sad news of the bombing of the country home of the President General of Ohaneze, Chief Nnia Nwodo. This is a highly provocative and cowardly act. 

"It is public knowledge that Chief Nwodo has recently been a victim of unprovoked verbal attack and threats from certain quarters for reasons of his principled stand on issues in the line of duty as the President General of Ohaneze. 

"It is also not unlikely that some terrorist organisations from outside Igbo land may be behind this dastardly act with a view to provoking Ndigbo to take precipitate action.

"We call on the Police, DSS and all relevant security agencies to spread out their dragnet to track down and bring to justice the‎ culprits and their sponsors.
