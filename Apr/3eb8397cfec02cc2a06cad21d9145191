In a bid to checkmate the continuous security challenges bedeviling the country, the federal government on Wednesday launched a fusion center meant to analyse and gather intelligence at the Defence Intelligence Agency. The minister of Defence, Alhaji Mansur Dan Ali, during the launch was briefed by the Theatre commander in Maiduguri, and command heads in Bamako, Yaounde and Niamey via video teleconference. The minister noted that the centre was timely in view of the myriad of security challenges facing the country and “the need for modern trends and capacity building”. He said, “the fusion centre will no doubt enhance intelligence analysis and will enable the agency contribute meanifully to achieving our national security objectives. “This administration has kept no one in doubt of its commitment to leave no stone unturned in ensuring the wellbeing of its citizens, especially those of the security services, who go the extra mile in ensuring the security of the populace and the safety of our nation’s territorial integrity”. The minister also commissioned a hostel at the agency’s college at Karu, a staff quarters at Mabushi, operational vehicles and a fire service station at the DIA headquarters. Earlier the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Air Vice Marshal Mohammed Usman, said that seven projects will be commissioned to show the agency’s commitment to make the intelligence enterprise more effective, resilient and responsive to the needs of the country during these complex security challenges. The Intelligence chief who noted that the complex security challenges can only be solved by unconventional thinking said, “we have focused our mission at the agency on four cardinal pillars, first, the strengthening of the institutional core through discipline, welfare, prudence, integrity and excellence in administration. “Next is the enhancement of operational capabilities through the comprehensive adoption and utilization of technology while building and sharpening our capacity to employ and deploy these tools and force multipliers”.
