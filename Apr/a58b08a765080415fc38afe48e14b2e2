The man suspected of carrying out a van attack in Muenster was a lone German who suffered mental health problems, the state interior minister has said. Authorities have searched four homes associated with the suspect, and said they have found “no clues” pointing to an extremist or political motive. Two people were killed when a van was driven into a restaurant terrace area of the west German city on Saturday. The 48-year-old driver shot and killed himself after hitting diners. He has been identified in German media as Jens R - prosecutors say he was known to police. In 2015 and 2016, he had faced allegations of making threats, damaging property, a hit-and-run traffic accident and fraud, all of which were dropped.
