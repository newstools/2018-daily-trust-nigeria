Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said no evidence has been found of a chemical weapons attack in Syria’s formerly rebel-held town of Douma. Medical sources say dozens were killed in Saturday’s alleged attack but numbers are impossible to verify. Mr Lavrov said Russian specialists and aid workers had visited the area, which rebel fighters have started leaving under a surrender deal. The US and France have threatened a “joint, strong response”. US President Donald Trump said on Monday that the situation was being assessed and “major decisions” would be made within 48 hours.
