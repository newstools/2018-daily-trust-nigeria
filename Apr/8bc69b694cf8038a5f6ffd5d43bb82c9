As the nationwide health workers strike clocks one week today, the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada chapter says it will not shift ground until the Federal Government meets their demands. City News reports that activities at the teaching hospital have remained paralysed. The JOHESU branch chairman in the hospital, Comrade Steven Orichar, said it was unfortunate that government has failed to honour the agreement reached with the national body of the union. He said it was disheartening that six months after, a government that was fighting corruption and believed in the rule of law, had made no concrete move to discharge its promises to the health workers. He said his union had asked government to look into CONHESS adjustment and payment of CONHESS arrears among others to its members. He also said the union was asking government to raise the retirement age of its workers from 60 to 65, which he claimed it has already done for medical doctors in the health sector across the country.
