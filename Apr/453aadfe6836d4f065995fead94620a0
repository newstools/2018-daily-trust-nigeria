The Lagos State Commissioner for Home Affairs,  Dr Abdulhakeem Abdullateef, has revealed how the refusal of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to sponsor pilgrims to Mecca and Jerusalem has saved the state the sum of N4.5 billion in three years. Dr Abdullateef revealed this yesterday at a ministerial press briefing he addressed to highlight the third- year achievements of the Gov Ambode administration. According to him, in the last administration a sum of N1.5bn was being used annually to sponsor Muslim and Christian pilgrims to Saudi Arabia and Israel. “At the assumption of office, Governor Ambode insisted that he would not be sponsoring people to hajj or Jerusalem. He, however, said government would at all times be providing the enabling environment for those who want to participate in the pilgrimages so that they are not maltreated outside the country. “Through that measure, we have succeeded in saving N4.5bn, and the monies saved are being used for construction of roads and other developmental programmes in the state,” the commissioner said. Abdulateef warned religious organisations causing obstructions on public roads to desist from doing so as such acts would no longer be tolerated. “There are places where prayers will not be accepted. If you block the road as a Muslim while praying, your prayers won’t be accepted. I am also a Chief Imam and I know what I am saying. The road is not part of your survey. If your congregations are many, then you should split the worship into two services,” he said.
