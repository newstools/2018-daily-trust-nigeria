The Appeal Court sitting in Ado Ekiti has told a High Chief in Ilawe-Ekiti, Chief Idowu Ibiowotisi, to stop parading himself as the Olomodulawe of Ilawe-Ekiti and the chief of Oke-Emo Quarters in the town. The appellate court also restrained the paramount monarch of the town, Oba Adebanji Alabi, who is the 5th respondent in the suit and the 2nd respondent, Chief Gbenga Agbona, from recognizing Ibiowotisi as the Olomodulawe. The Olomodulawe chieftancy title in Ilawe-Ekiti is rotational among three families - Gbadamosi, Fatimehin and Fajemisin. Ibiowotisi, who is the first respondent, was installed as the new Olomodulawe after the demise of Chief Zacheus Fatimehin. Not satisfied with the process of selection, the appellants challenged the eligibility of the 1st respondent at the Ekiti High Court. In its judgment on October 19, 2016, the court struck out the case, for lack of jurisdiction. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the trial court, the appellants lodged an instant appeal against the judgment at the Appeal Court. Justice Fatima Omoro Akinbami, in her lead judgment yesterday, declared that it was the turn of the Fajemuyin family of the Olomodulawe to produce a candidate for the Olomodulawe title after the demise of the late Chief Fatimehin of the Fatimehin branch. Justice Akinbami said that she had evaluated the evidence placed before the trial court that the appellant made written and oral representation to the then paramount ruler, the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, who is the prescribed authority on the chieftaincy title, adding that despite the letter of protest written by the appellants, Ibiowotosi was picked as the new Olomodulawe. “I am satisfied that the appellants placed enough evidence both in oral and documentary before the trial court in proving their case. I, therefore, have no hesitation in granting all the reliefs sought by the appellants,” she said.
