The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has reiterated his commitment to completing all road projects before May. Candido, who made this known during a two-day inspection of projects within the council, said the financial difficulties in assessing funds would not stop him from delivering the dividends of democracy to residents. He said the financial constraint was not an excuse for government and assured residents that the little they got would be used in the provision of amenities. “Though we had a little challenge of fund but we are working hard to ensure that road construction projects are concluded before the rain sets in. We will ensure that before 20th of May most of these projects are completed. “We have faced many challenges. One area that the area council gets its resource is tenement rate and we resumed collection in very unfriendly revenue months, January and February. So between April and September things should be better,” he said. Among the projects inspected were the township roads in Jiwa, Idu and Karmo and the Gwagwa market.
