A 300-level Petroleum Engineering student of the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO), Chibueze Ezenwafor, has been declared missing. The student disappeared last Thursday, March 29, after placing a call to his mother around 3.30pm which was not answered, according to a source close to him. The source said that when his mother saw Chibueze’s missed call by 3:45 pm, she dialed his line a number of times but his phone was switched off. His roommate said that he left for his friend’s place to complete a course assignment. His brother Ezenwafor Tochukwu took to his Face book page to write, “Two days gone already and my brother is still nowhere to be found. He is a student of FUTO, Petroleum Engineering Dept.
