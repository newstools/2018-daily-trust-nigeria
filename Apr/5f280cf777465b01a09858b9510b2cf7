Doctors will treat and operate on at least 500 patients free of charge at Abaji General Hospital in Abuja starting next Monday April 30, the Nigerian Medical Association has announced. The two-day outreach to provide free treatment is part of activities lined up for the association’s 58th annual delegate meeting and scientific conference to hold in Abuja. NMA president, Dr Mike Ogirima, expected to end his leadership of the association this year, said, “We are ready to do more depending on availability of resources. “We welcome collaborative partnerships from individuals, faith-based organisations and corporate organisations to extend healthcare to those who have been left out of due to no fault of theirs.” The association estimates more than 500,000 Nigerians excluded by geography have benefited from the outreaches which accompany the association’s meetings nationwide. The outreach is planned to go on despite declaration of strike, which will see nurses, pharmacists and all health workers other than doctors out of hospitals.
