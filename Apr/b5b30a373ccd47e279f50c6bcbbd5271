Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has promised to reform laws which he says have led to human rights abuses in the country. He has also pledged to ensure that the next elections in 2020 will be free and fair and the playing field will be level for the opposition, which currently does not have a single lawmaker in the 500-member parliament. . Mr Abiy was speaking at a rally in the capital, Addis Ababa, where he once again called for patience as his government embarks on reforms to heal the country after nearly three years of anti-government protests left hundreds of people dead. Mr Abiy was sworn in as Ethiopia’s new prime minister about two weeks ago, replacing Hailemariam Desalegn, who unexpectedly resigned.
