The FCT Administration (FCTA) has said that though there have been no confirmed cases of cholera in the territory, residents should maintain proper hygiene at all times. The Executive Secretary FCT Primary Health Care Development Board (FCT PHCDB), Dr. Mathew Ashikeni, revealed this at the weekend during the flag off of the April 2018 National Immunization Day Plus in the FCT. The event was flagged off in Nyanya, Abuja. He said over 800,000 children (0-59 months old) are targeted for the immunization exercise which, according to him, is aimed at delivering an integrated package of interventions to ensure the welfare of women and children. He said the FCT Administration is committed to the delivery of improved and quality health care for residents and appealed for the participation and involvement of all residents. Dr Ashikeni urged parents to cooperate with the trained vaccinators deplored for the exercise to ensure that all eligible children are immunized. He called on residents to actively participate during the week by washing their hands regularly, desisting from open defecation, adopting good personal hygiene and ensuring exclusive breastfeeding of children. He commended the partners and donor agencies, the National Polio Emergency Operation Centre of the NPHCDA, for their support and encouragement and urged the chairmen of area councils to take up the challenge and release counterpart funding and attend daily IPDs evening review meetings.
