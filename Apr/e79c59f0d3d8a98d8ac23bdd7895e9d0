The Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Muhammed Bello, has called on the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) to amend its threshold for agencies to allow for easy procurement process. He made the appeal on Saturday in Abuja, during the public procurement retreat for Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and accounting officers of parastatals and agencies of the Federal Government organised by the BPP. The theme of the retreat is: “Public Procurement for Sustainable National Growth.” Bello said that although the threshold to limit what the CEOs could procure without going through the BPP was very important, it limits certain activities that should ordinarily be carried out with ease by the agencies. “The Procurement Act and procurement officers have to be able to appreciate the reality on ground that certain transactions are certified under direct labour. “You need to be given the freedom and flexibility to deploy resources quickly and promptly to address those issues that if you wait for a long process will generate into something much more bigger, more expensive and maybe even more dangerous.
