The Kwara State Road Traffic Management Authority (KWARTMA), said it nhad impounded 400 vehicles and 350 motorcycles between January and now over various traffic offences committed in different parts of the state. The agency’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Yekeen Babatunde-Bello, disclosed this to our correspondent in llorin yesterday. Babatunde-Bello spoke on the sideline of a capacity workshop organised for the personnel of the authority, in conjunction with the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), to update the knowledge of KWARTMA personnel on modern traffic rules and regulations. He said the 400 vehicles and 350 motorcycles were impounded from owners across the 16 local government areas of the state. Many owners of the impounded vehicles and motorcycles, according to him, had been coming to the authority to pay fines imposed on them to claim their vehicles and motorbikes. Babatunde-Bello expressed the commitment of the authority to collaborate with the FRSC toward ensuring that sanity prevailed in road traffic in all parts of the state. He said that three persons who assaulted some of the personnel of the authority at the Post Office area of llorin, who were performing their official assignment, had been prosecuted. Bello warned the staff of KWARTMA to always be polite to motorists, and shun extortion and other acts that could tarnish the image of the Authority. •
