Natives of Abuja have urged the FCT Administration (FCTA) to formulate a land policy that will protect their interests. They said they should be allowed to contribute in the formulation of such policies as several resettling and integration policies have failed in addressing their plights. The natives, under the aegis of Garki Chiefdom Elite Forum, while addressing journalists, yesterday, appealed to the government to come up with a template that would be acceptable by the natives and other stakeholders in the territory. The chairman of the group, John Bawa, demanded a repeal of the FCT Act “so that our customary right will be recognised under the Land Use Act and the constitution can be respected.” He said the current rates and methods of assessment of economic trees and crops for compensation should also be reviewed in accordance with the constitution and global best practices. “We are committed to the unity of Nigeria. We must, however, stress the fact that constant invasion and violation of our natural inclination towards peace is being stretched to the limit and may no longer hold if the violations of our rights persist,” he said. The group’s legal adviser, Barr James Eggah, alleged that government had been allocating their houses to private and corporate organisations “to develop in their own private interest which negates the overriding public interest as indicated in the constitution.” He said the natives had written an eight agenda letter to the FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, saying that they have ran out of patience and if prompt action was not taken as demanded, “we will not have any other option but to stand up in defence of our homes, farms, business premises and more importantly, our lives and the future of our children.” They said several agitations in the past have failed to address the incessant invasion of the peaceful existence of Abuja natives and the constant security threat and trespass on their land.
