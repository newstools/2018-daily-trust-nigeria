The Kwara state Police Command recently said it had recovered 57 illegal weapons across the state. The Spokesman of the command, Mr Ajayi Okasanmi, disclosed this at a public lecture on security sensitisation campaign against political thuggery, kidnapping and drug addiction. The programme was organised by the National Orientation Agency (NOA) in the state. Okasanmi, who spoke on security of lives and property of the residents, disclosed that the weapons were recovered during the  command’s month-long operations. “As the 2019 elections draw nearer, the command will intensify more on the recovery of illegal arms to allow trouble-free election to hold in the state,’’ he said.  Okasanmi, said police alone could not provide security  and that other stakeholders  needed to cooperate and support the force.  An official of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Mr Ango Mohammed-Tukur, lamented how some youths indulged in drug abuse.  Mohammed-Tukur said that a number of them were in the habit of using Tramadol, Hemp and codeine.  The official, therefore, solicited the cooperation of all stakeholders in the state to get rid of drug addiction.  The Ohoro of Shao in Moro Local Government Area, Oba Bamidele Adegbite, advised security agencies to be on top of their responsibilities.  The NOA state Director, Mr Segun Adeyemi, called for the support of all stakeholders to make the society free of social vices.
