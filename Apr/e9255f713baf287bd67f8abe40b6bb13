Oyo State Governor Abiola Ajimobi has given butchers in the 11 local governments of Ibadanland until end of April to relocate to the multi-billion naira central abattoir in Amosun village, Akinyele Local Government, Ibadan. The governor gave the directive during a stakeholdersâ€™ meeting at the House of Chiefs, Secretariat, Ibadan, yesterday. The Butchers Association was led to the meeting by the Southwest Coordinator, Alhaji Biliaminu Elesinmeta and the State Chairman, Alhaji Azeez Alagunfon. Apart from its state-of-the-art facilities that would promote the hygiene of meat consumers, the governor said it was also capable of ending the incessant clashes between herders and farmers. He said the meeting was called to find a lasting solution to issues surrounding the relocation of butchers in the state capital to the central abattoir and to dispel l the misgivings about the project. Ajimobi said the abattoir was a joint venture among a private establishment, C & E Consulting Ltd, the state government, the 11 LGs and 14 Local Council Development Areas in Ibadanland, as well as the butchers. He said the private partners would have 50 per cent share; the LGs and LCDAs would have 36 per cent; state government, 10 per cent; while the butchers would have 4 per cent in the ownership structure. Leaders of the butchers thanked the governor for allaying their fears about the project, and for support in the area of financial empowerment and donation of a new bus to members. They however appealed to the state government to reduce the N3,500 cost attached to each butchered cow in the new facility, and solicited logistic support for members located in other parts of Ibadan .
