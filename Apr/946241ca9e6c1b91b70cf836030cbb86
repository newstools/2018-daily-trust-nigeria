The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Abuja has appealed to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) residents to uphold the principles of love, service and sacrifice in making the territory a better place. The church’s North Stake President, Eric Mbibi, said the principles are important for residents in ensuring that they live in peace and harmony. Mbibi, who spoke during the open house programme of the church in Kubwa, Abuja, said the church has taken it upon itself to commission people that will teach residents these principles. “Those that accept these principles are welcome into the church and as they learn and apply these principles, it affects the community at large because they are members of the community,” he said. He said the open house programme was to encourage residents to observe activities in the church and also announce the presence of the church to community leaders, government and other denominations. “The church does open house for new construction that has taken place. We hope to bring the church out of obscurity because it is not well known so we reach out to other denominations, opinion leaders and the government and community that the church exists in.”
