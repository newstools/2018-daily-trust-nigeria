The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Tuesday in  Abuja, re-arraigned Nanle Dariye, son of former Plateau governor, Sen.  Joshua Dariye, on a six-count amended charge of money laundering. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the total sum in question is about N1.5 billion. Dariye who was re-arraigned before Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu at the  Federal High Court, Abuja, entered a “not guilty” plea to all  six-counts. When the matter was called, the prosecuting counsel, Mr George  Adebola said that the matter was for re-arraignment and prayed the court  to read the charge to the defendant to take his plea. Justice Ojukwu adjourned the matter until April 27 and May 10 for commencement of trial. It will be recalled that the EFCC had first arraigned Dariye on Feb.  27 on the same charges alongside Apartment le Paradis, a hotel where he  was a director. The anti-graft agency alleged that the defendant sometime in 2013,  failed to report a cash transaction to the tune of about N1.5 billion  which he received through the hotel’s account in one of the old  generation banks. It said that the amount was above the threshold of the N10 million  permissible by law and that the hotel was also not registered as  Designated Non-Financial Institution, (DNFI). The agency said the offense contravened Section 5(1) (a) of the Money  Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 as amended and punishable under  Section 5 (b) of the same Act. Dariye’s was admitted to bail in the sum of N5 million with two sureties in like sum. (NAN)
