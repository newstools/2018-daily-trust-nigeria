The speaker of Somalia’s parliament, Mohamed Osman Jawari, has officially resigned, in an emotional speech in the chamber. “Instead of dividing our parliament I decided to make a compromise and resign,” Mr Jawari told MPs in a speech broadcast live on privately owned Somali Broadcasting Corporation TV. “I would like to ask the Somali people for forgiveness if I have caused them any pain,” Jawari said, while wiping away tears. The 72-year-old veteran politician was elected speaker twice, on 28 August 2012 and 11 January 2017. He resigned before completing his second term, following a one-month stand-off over a controversial no-confidence motion filed against him. First Deputy Speaker Abdiweli Mudey will serve in Mr Jawari’s post in an acting capacity until a new speaker is appointed.
