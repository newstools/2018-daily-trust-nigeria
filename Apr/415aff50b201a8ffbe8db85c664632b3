Fresh crisis is rocking the Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education (AIFCE), Owerri, following a demand by a faction of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of the college that the Acting Provost, Dr. Dan Anyanwu, should  step down. The faction is allegedly angry that the provost dared them by aspiring to become the substantive provost. The demand of the group led by Dr. Benjamin Nwokedi, is said to be defy an earlier directive by the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, on the procedure for the appointment of a substantive provost. The faction had disrupted the ongoing examination of the college in an attempt to force out the provost. Condemning the action of the group, the management said in a statement, “The college is currently in the middle of her first semester examinations and as such any call for strike is a calculated attempt to disrupt the academic calendar and punish the students for selfish reasons.” It was gathered that the group is agitating for a region in the state to produce the next provost, having not produced one since the establishment of the institution.
