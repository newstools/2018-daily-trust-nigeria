A governorship aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue State, Prof Eugene Aliegba, has threatened to drag the Nigerian Army to court over its personnel’s alleged invasion of Naka town in Gwer West Local Government Area of the state. Soldiers from the Nigerian Army had allegedly razed down a sizeable portion of Naka town during which two people reportedly lost their lives last Thursday as a reprisal for the killing of one of their colleagues by suspected villagers. Aliegba who visited the affected area to condole with the people yesterday demanded a thorough investigation into the incident which led to the loss of lives and property in Naka phase II. He threatened that if the matter was not properly addressed, he would take a court action on the military for invading Naka town, his ancestral home, “to cause serious damage to the people they were expected to protect.” The aspirant urged non-governmental organisations, public spirited individuals and the international community to help the displaced people in the area.
