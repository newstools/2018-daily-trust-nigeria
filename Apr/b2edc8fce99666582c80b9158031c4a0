The Director, FCTA Department of Development Control, Mukhtar Galadima, has warned that residents of the FCT who encroach on road corridors will face demolition. He also advised those that have already put illegal structures on road corridors anywhere within the territory to remove them. Galadima gave the warning, Thursday, while leading the demolition of an estate under construction in Kukwaba, and shops built on Lokogoma road corridor. He said Sally Dram Estate, located by an AEDC injection substation in Kukwaba, on Airport Road, abused the building plan. The director explained that the developer was given approval for the construction of 24 units of 3-bedroom duplexes, but that he decided to add about nine units. He also said extension of shops in front of Faith Plaza and Vatan Plaza, as well as a park and a church, along Lokogoma expressway were all demolished during the exercise. Galadima stated that the era of impunity was over, and warned residents to always adhere to development control guidelines in order to avoid having their structures pulled down after spending money on them.
