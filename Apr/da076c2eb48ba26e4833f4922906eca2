The Nigerian Army has said that it was not recruiting into the Direct Short Service commission as being reported ‎by some sections of the media particularly in  the social media.  The  Nigerian Army added that the said publication did not emanate from the Nigerian Army but rather it was the handy work of fraudsters trying to obtain money from unsuspecting members of the public.  In a statement signed by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Texas Chukwu said that the advertisement for Commission into the Nigerian Army could not be placed in  any social media platforms nor given a time frame of only four days for interested candidates to apply.  Chukwu added that the  Army wishes to disassociate itself from the said advertisement and ‎advise the public to beware of the fraudsters trying to dupe unsuspecting applicants.  He announced that the Nigerian Army will inform the general public through the appropriate quarters when it wants to recruit.  He however offered a stern warning to all those involved in such criminal acts  to desist from it in their own interest.
