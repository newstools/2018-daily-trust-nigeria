Nwachinemerem Elizabeth Oduenyi Foundation (NEOF) has donated 50 walking sticks and foodstuff to pupils and students of School for the Blind, Jabi, Abuja. Making the donation on Good Friday, the founder of NEOF, Oduenyi Elizabeth Onuoha, said she was inspired to celebrate Easter with the less privileged. She said she wanted to put smiles on the faces impaired students’ faces. “It is Easter and I need to celebrate Jesus with the children. I want to give them hope that they can be anything they want to be if they work hard. “I chose to celebrate with them because these are children who have impairments but they are like every other child that needs love,” she said. She urged the children to remain emotionally strong so that they can read hard and become doctors, engineers, accountants and lawyers. Responding, the principal of the school said they were overwhelmed with the show of love to the blind children, adding that it (love) would motivate them to study harder. She said running an institution like that was tough and they needed all the support they could get from philanthropists.
