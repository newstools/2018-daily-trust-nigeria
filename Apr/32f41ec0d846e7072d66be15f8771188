Britain’s prime minister has defended the UK’s decision to launch coordinated strikes with American and French forces, in an attempt to “further prevent the use of chemical weapons” in Syria. Speaking at the House of Commons on Monday, Theresa May said the UK’s involvement in Saturday’s attacks on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons sites was in the national interest. “We have not done this because [US] President [Donald] Trump asked us to do so,” she told parliament. “We have done it because we believe it was the right thing to do, and we are not alone.” Many opposition MPs have questioned May’s decision to join the attack without seeking parliamentary approval. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, reiterated his stance that May is “accountable to the parliament - not to the whims of the US president”. He also questioned the legal justification for the attack, saying it was not in line with the UN Security Council’s charter.
