France’s government has announced plans to cut the number of lawmakers by almost a third as part of sweeping reforms of the country’s institutions. The changes, considered to be one of the biggest in decades, were agreed between Prime Minister Édouard Philippe and the opposition-controlled Senate. Mr Philippe has also revealed plans to introduce proportional representation to choose 15% of lawmakers. The reforms are in line with President Emmanuel Macron’s campaign promises. The changes still need to be approved by both houses of parliament. There are currently 348 seats in the Senate and 577 in the National Assembly. “These bills will contribute to a deep renovation of political and parliamentary life, in a spirit of responsibility, representativity and efficiency,” Mr Philippe said.
