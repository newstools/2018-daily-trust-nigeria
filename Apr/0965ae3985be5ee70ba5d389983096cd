Namibia is to compensate the families of people killed by wild animals, including crocodile and hippos, with up to 100,000 Namibian dollars ($8,330; £5,798). But it comes with a disclaimer. Environment and Tourism Minister Pohamba Shifeta has said, “We will not pay [that sum] for people killed by crocodiles and hippos while swimming or bathing in rivers, because that situation can be avoided.” Nine people were killed by wild animals in 2016 and six in 2017, according to Namibian government data.
