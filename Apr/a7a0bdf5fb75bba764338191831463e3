Liverpool produced a blistering first-half display to stun Manchester City 3-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at Anfield on Wednesday.

Mohamed Salah opened the scoring after 12 minutes before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made it 2-0 shortly afterwards with a superb strike.

City looked in disarray defensively and they fell further behind after half an hour as Sadio Mane headed home.

The deadlock was broken after just 12 minutes as the hosts countered and Roberto Firmino won the ball off Kyle Walker and poked across for Salah to fire in his 38th goal of the season in all competitions.

Leroy Sane went close to a quick response when he dragged a shot wide, but from then on it was one-way traffic as Liverpool seized control of the tie in stunning fashion.

Oxlade-Chamberlain rifled in a superb second from 25 yards before Salah crossed for Mane to head in after half an hour.

City, who can win the Premier League when they face Manchester United on Saturday, looked shell-shocked and could have fallen further behind on the stroke of half-time as Virgil van Dijk powered a header wide from a free-kick.

While the first half was all about Liverpool's impressive attacking qualities, the second half saw them defend fantastically to keep an improved City at bay.

The visitors dominated possession and finally started to find spaces, but did not muster a shot on target as Liverpool held on to their three-goal advantage.
