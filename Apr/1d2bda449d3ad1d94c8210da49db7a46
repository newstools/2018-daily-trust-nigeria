Barcelona secured a 4-1 first-leg victory at the Nou Camp to take full control of their Champions League quarter-final tie with Roma.

Ernesto Valverde's side struggled for rhythm for much of the game against the Italian side, but built a three-goal advantage thanks to own goals either side of half-time from Daniele De Rossi (40) and Kostas Manolas (55) and a tap in from Gerard Pique (59).

Edin Dzeko gave Roma a late glimmer of hope heading into next week's second leg at the Stadio Olimpico by scoring an away goal, but Luis Suarez (87) landed a late blow as Barca put one foot in the last four.
