The Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) has identified the activities of middlemen as the major obstacle that the Muhammadu Buhari  administration needs to address. The Chairman of the Zaria branch of the association, Muhammad Lawal Jibril, told Daily Trust that farmers appreciated the efforts of the administration to uplift the capacity of farmers, but the Federal Government needed to check exploitation of farmers. He said, “We sensitised our members based on what the government promised. However, some middlemen are now exploiting farmers. The initial arrangement was that farmers would be given money based on their capacity. They now changed the money to supply of farm implements. We don’t have problem with that but with the prices of what they are giving. For example, the pumping machine they are giving at N43,000 is sold in the market at N27,000. Same thing goes for fertilizer. The market price of NPK 15:15:15 is N5,500, but the price they are giving at association level is N7,500.”
