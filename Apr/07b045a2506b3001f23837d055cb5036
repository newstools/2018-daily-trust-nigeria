As part of activities marking the forth-year anniversary of Chibok school girls’ abduction by Boko Haram insurgents, the ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) has expressed solidarity with families, friends and the Chibok community, who have endured agony over their missing loved ones. The Country Director of AAN, Ene Obi said in a statement that “The abduction of the Dapchi girls’ although now released has further heightened the vulnerability of the Nigerian girl-child, both in conflict and non-conflict zones. Hence, government at all levels must prioritise safe cities, provision of security and safe spaces in our schools in order to encourage girls’ enrolment and retention as well as protect them from all forms of violence.” She urged the Federal Government and the Nigeria military to adopt its intelligence, power and negotiation as deployed for the release of the Dapchi girls, to bring back the remaining 113 missing Chibok girls and the remaining Dapchi girl, Leah Shuaibu. “While we commend the efforts of the Federal Government and the Nigeria military for securing the release of some of these kidnapped girls. However, today we remember the 113 girls that are yet to be rescued and we join our voice with their families, friends in Nigeria and the international community to call on the Nigerian government to intensify effort to bring back the girls,” Obi said.
