Some Nigerian youths under the Democratic Youth Congress (DYC) have concluded plans to purchase nomination form for President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election bid. The national chairman of DYC, Kassim Muhammed Kassim, a member of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, said the group with about four million registered members, had unanimously agreed to mobilize and contribute a thousand naira each to sponsor and buy the form for the president. He said those criticizing the president’s decision to re-contest in 2019 should rather channel their grievances towards the youths for forcing the president to seek re-election. He said the group had earlier approached the court to compel the president to seek re-election because of the giant strides of his administration. Kassim said it was in view of the president’s resolve to seek re-election that the group further approached the court to discontinue the suit because it had already been overtaken by events. Earlier, DYC’s counsel, Ismail Zubairu, had told the court that the plaintiff had on April 17 filed a notice of discontinuance and no response had been received from the defendants. He therefore applied for the case to be struck out. The trial judge, Justice Binta Nyako, accordingly struck out the case.
