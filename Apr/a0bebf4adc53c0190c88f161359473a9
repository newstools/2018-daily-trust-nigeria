The Federal Government has been urged to take radical measures against rice smuggling into the country. The Chief Executive Officer of Agro Nigeria, Mr Richard-Mark Mbaram gave the charge, while briefing newsmen yesterday on the firm’s High-Level Rice Conference billed to hold on April 10 and 11, in Abuja. He said activities of rice smugglers threaten business security of those involved in rice production in the country. “The quantity of rice coming into the countries flanking Nigeria outnumbers their population and those bags of rice are heading nowhere but Nigeria. The government needs to take definite, radical measures. There is no point playing a big brother role. It is about the businesses of Nigerian citizens. “There are businesses in the country that are involved in rice production. What do the activities of smugglers say about the security of their businesses? Let’s get radical. If we have to confront these countries and read a riot act to them, so be it. That level of confrontation is what we need to put the conversion on the front burner,” he said.
