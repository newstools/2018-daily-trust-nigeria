 Some 121 couples have graduated from training in “responsible” Islamic married life. The Muslim group “Abu Ayyub Al-Ansar Islamic Foundation” in Fagge, Kano, says the training is to teach couples, especially men, of their responsibilities as heads of families as taught by Islam. The trainees include couples already married, and 25 expected to be joined soon in marriage. Founder of the Foundation, Umar Sani-Fagge said the rampant divorce in the country, especially the north has become worrisome, therefore, the couples should utilise the knowledge they acquired during the training in reducing the menace. “Such training will also assist the couples to build a better family which can lead to the realisation of a better society. “The Islamic teaching has provided ways and manners in which couples will treat each other in an orderly way in their homes to ensure a peaceful and united family. “Most of the issues responsible for the rampant cases of divorce among the faithful is the lack of Islamic knowledge on the marriage life. “This training is necessary to reduce the issue of divorce which has become a serious challenge to the Muslim society,’’ he said. In his address at the event, the Speaker Kano State House of Assembly, Alhaji Abdullahi Ata said the statement assembly will ensure the is included in primary and secondary school syllabus “only for study purposes by students”. “If such course is introduced in the school’s syllable, it will give youths the opportunity to know about the Islamic marriage before getting married,” he said.
