US President Donald Trump has cancelled his first official trip to Latin America to focus on the issue of a suspected chemical attack in Syria. He will remain in Washington to “oversee the American response to Syria”, the White House said. Meanwhile, the global chemical weapons watchdog has said it will send a fact-finding team to the site in Douma. Medical sources say dozens were killed in the alleged attack there, but exact numbers are impossible to verify. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said a team would deploy to Syria “shortly”. It comes after Syria and its military backer, Russia, both said they wanted to facilitate a visit by inspectors. Syria denies being behind any chemical attack.
