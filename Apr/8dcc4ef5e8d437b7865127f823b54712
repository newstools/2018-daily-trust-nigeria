The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday told the Federal High Court in Lagos that neither the former FCT Minister Ms Jumoke Akinjide nor any of the other two co-accused standing a joint trial was tortured or induced to make statement. Usman Zakari, an operative of the  EFCC in the ongoing trial of Jumoke Akinjide and two others, stated this yesterday while testifying in a trial within trial to determine if statements made by  Akinjide and her co-accused were voluntary. The other defendants were Ayo Adeseun who represented Oyo Central Senatorial District between 2011 and 2015, and a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader in Oyo State, Chief Olarenwaju Otiti. They all claimed that EFCC coerced them to make their statements on the offence preferred against them at the commission’s office. Akinjide’s lawyer, Mr. Olusegun Williams opposed moves by EFCC’s counsel Rotimi Oyedepo to tender the statements in evidence on the basis that they were obtained under duress. EFCC had accused the defendants of conspiring to directly take possession of N650 million, which they reasonably ought to have known was part of proceeds of an unlawful act. Justice Muslim Hassan had ordered a trial within trial to determine if the statements were made voluntarily. Led in evidence by prosecuting counsel Nnaemeka Omenwa, who stood in for Oyedepo, Zakari, who heads the commission’s Special Task Force 4, said the defendants were not forced to make a statement. He said when Adeseun reported at the commission on May 11, 2016, he agreed to make a statement only in his lawyer’s presence. “We had to wait for his lawyer to come before he made statements. The following day, the second defendant made a statement voluntarily in the presence of his lawyer,” he said.
