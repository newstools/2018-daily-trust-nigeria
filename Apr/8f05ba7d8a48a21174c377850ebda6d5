An FCT High Court, Kubwa, Abuja has dissolved a 10-year-old marriage between one Ekpolador Koinya and Onajero Gloria over the wife’s aggressive nature. Justice Bello Kawu also ordered that Gloria return a 12KVA Mikano generator set and her daughter’s international passport in her possession to the petitioner, Koinya. Kawu added that both parties should stay away from each other’s work place. The marriage, which was contracted at the Marriage Registry, Lagos State on Feb. 1, 2008, produced two children. Koinya had sought the dissolution of his marriage with Gloria on the grounds that the marriage had broken down due to her aggressive nature. He also claimed that Gloria attacked him at the slightest excuse and had denied him his conjugal rights. He prayed the court for the custody of his two children, an order for Gloria to stop using his names and for her to stay away from his dwelling place. Gloria, in response, consented to the dissolution of the marriage on the grounds that Koinya behaved in a way that she was unable to live with. (NAN)
