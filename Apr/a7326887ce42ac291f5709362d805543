The Nigerian Army on Friday said it arrested a key Boko Haram suspect known as Aminu Yaminu a.k.a. Tashaku who is believed to have masterminded most of the recent attacks in Benue State. The Assistant Director, Army Public Relations, 707 Special Forces Brigade in Makurdi, Major Olabisi Ayeni, said that the combined troops of 707 Special Forces Brigade, Nigeria Police and the Department of State Security Services in Makurdi effected the arrested. "Following an intelligence report, it was gathered that Aminu has concluded plans with his cohorts in Bauchi, Borno, Yobe and Nasarawa states to launch a major attack on innocent citizens in Benue State," Ayeni stated. He further reinstated the Nigerian Army's resolve to ensure that enemies of peace in the state areÂ  brought to justice and encouraged all law-abiding citizens to go about their lawful businesses without fear. Ayeni appealed to residents to oblige the Nigerian Army and other security agencies with timely information that could lead to the arrests of criminal elements in the society.
