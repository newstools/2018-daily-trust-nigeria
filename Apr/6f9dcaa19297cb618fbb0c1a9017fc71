A former Deputy National Legal Adviser of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Barrister Bashir Maidugu, has dumped the party for the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said he dumped the party to enable him campaign vigorously for President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election. In a message yesterday in Abuja, Maidugu also noted that the new leadership of the PDP as constituted does not reflect answers to the problems of Nigeria and does not have the capacity to midwife the right candidates. “I write to announce to the Nigerian public of my decision to resign as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),” the statement said in part.
