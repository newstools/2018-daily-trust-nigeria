The Federal Safety Corps [FRSC] has said the national address system scheme of the Nigerian Postal Service [NIPOST] will reduce road crashed in the country. The FRSC Corps Marshal Mr Boboye Oyeyemi, who disclosed this in Abuja yesterday when he inaugurated the Special Marshal Unit of NIPOST, also said the national address system would help trace traffic offenders to their houses. ‘’ Let me say here today that the collaboration between us and NIPOST will be symbiotic and beneficial because the new NIPOST national address system will help us in reducing road crashes. ‘’ It will help us to trace traffic offenders to their houses and give them ticket. If they refuse to pay we take them to court’’, Oyeyemi, who was represented by an Assistant Corps Marshal Victor Nwokolo said. He cautioned the newly inaugurated Special Marshals in NIPOST not to see their new status as a means to break the law. Earlier, the Post Master General of NIPOST Barrister Bisi Adegbuyi assured that staff wouldn’t abuse the Special Marshal status conferred on the some staff of the Service.
