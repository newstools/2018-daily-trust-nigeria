Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu at the weekend granted the request of the people of Zuru community in Kebbi State to build a village for the annual Uhola cultural festival. Bagudu at the just concluded 2018 Uhola cultural festival and Agricultural Show in Zuruland said the festival was very important to the state because of the unity, peace and promotion it had brought to the community and by extension to Kebbi State. The Emir of Zuru, Alhaji Sani Sami, had requested the state government to build a festival village for the Uhola cultural festival to boost its tourism potentials and make it more attractive for tourists. The governor while granting the request promised to direct his commissioners for commerce and works to look into the feasibility of the project and to determine how it would look like. He said the state government was determined to develop the annual Uhola cultural festival because of its revenue potentials. “The state government is also willing to upgrade and support all the festivals in the state like Rigatta boat festival in Yauri, Hutungo Fulani festival and the more widely known Argungu international fishing festival,” he said. The four-day Uhola cultural festival featured mini fishing event at Ayu village, public lecture, book launch authored by the emir on the history of Zuru community, royal merit award to distinguished personalities in the community, agricultural show, archery, and Gala night before the grand finale on Saturday.
