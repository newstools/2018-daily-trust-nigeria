Botswana has inaugurated Mokgweetsi Masisi as its fifth president, in a ceremony designed to highlight a smooth transition of power in one of Africa’s strongest democracies. The ex-vice president took over on Sunday from Ian Khama, who stepped down after his term limit - 10 years - was reached. Elections are scheduled for next year. In his first address to the nation, Masisi vowed to focus on tackling unemployment, which stands at about 20 percent. “Botswana faces a myriad of challenges, such as unemployment, poverty, crime, HIV/AIDs, alcohol and drug abuse, amongst others,” he said. “Therefore, my top priorities as a president of this country will be to address the problem of unemployment, especially among the young people who constitute to the majority of our population.”
