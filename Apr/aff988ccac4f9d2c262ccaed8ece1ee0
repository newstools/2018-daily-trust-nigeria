The All Progressives Congress (APC) has announced new dates for this year’s ward, local government and state congresses even as Daily Trust gathered yesterday that the party’s National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has shelved his national chairmanship ambition. It could however not be confirmed whether the decision was connected to Oyegun’s visit to the Presidential Villa on Thursday night. But on Tuesday, he described the purported endorsement of former Governor Adams Oshiomhole by the South-South zonal leadership of the party as “absolutely childish.” Chief Odigie-Oyegun, who spoke with newsmen at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, said voting would take place at convention venue and not at any government house. On whether he would seek re-election, he said, “I’m going to know when the convention committee announces their programmes, then when I’m going to buy a form if I will re-contest I will let you know.” The new dates announced yesterday by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Malam Bolaji Abdullahi, are Saturday, May 5 for ward congresses, Saturday, May 12 for LGA congresses and Saturday, May 19 for state congresses. Abdullahi said the date for the national convention in June would be announced later. In the timetable earlier released, the party scheduled ward congresses for Wednesday, May 2, LG congresses for Saturday, May 5, state congresses for Wednesday, May 9 and national convention for May 14, 2018.
