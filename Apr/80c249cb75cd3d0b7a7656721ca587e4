A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, has sentenced a 20-year-old barber, Kabiru Abdullahi, to one month imprisonment for stabbing a man with a knife. Abdullahi, who resides at Kado village by Lento, Abuja, pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of joint act and causing grievous hurt. He begged the court for leniency. The judge, Mr Abubakar Sadiq, however, gave Abdullahi an option of N5, 000 fine. He warned the convict to desist from committing crime, adding that the punishment would have been stiffer if Abdullahi had not saved the court the pains of protracted prosecution by admitting committing the offences. The prosecuting counsel, Dalhatu Zannah, had told the court that the matter was reported on April 8, at Life Camp Police Station, Abuja, by one Zayyanu Abubakar of Kado village. Zannah said on April 7, at about 20:30 p.m. while the complainant was watching television at Angwan Saidu on Efab road, Abdullahi and one Mohammed, now at large, pushed the complainant down for no just cause. He said when the complainant asked the reasons for their action they beat him and stabbed him on the back with a knife. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 79 and 245 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
