President Donald Trump has defended his use of the term “mission accomplished” amid criticism following US, UK and French air strikes on targets in Syria. He accused the “fake news media” of seizing on the term to demean the strikes, carried out in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack. President George W Bush was ridiculed for appearing in front of a banner carrying the term during the Iraq war. Russia and Syria insist no chemical attack took place on 7 April. They have said the attack in Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta area near the capital, Damascus, was staged.
