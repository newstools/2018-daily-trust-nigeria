A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, has ordered that one Abdulrahman Sally, be given six strokes of the cane for stealing a cell phone. Sally who resides at Utako, Abuja, had pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of joint act and theft. The judge, Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq, who gave the order after Sally admitted committing the offence, said the court might not be lenient with him if he appeared before it again. The prosecutor, Zanna Dalhatu, had told the court that the matter was reported by one Eugene Dauda, of same address with Sally, at the Utako Police Station on March 29. The prosecutor said the convict on that same date, with one person who is now at large, snatched​ the complainant’s Tecno cell phone valued at N30, 000. Dalhatu said the  person at large escaped with the phone but Sally was caught with the help of passersby. During police investigation he confessed to the crime. The offences contravene sections 79 and 288 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
