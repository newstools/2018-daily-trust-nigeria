Justice Rilwan Aikawa, sitting at the Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday, dismissed the no case application filed by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria Mohammed Dele Belgore and former Minster of National Planning, Professor Sulaimon Abubakar. The court held that in view of the overwhelming evidence adduced by the prosecution, it would be better to apply a probative value to the evidence of the prosecution witness to be determined on its merit. “I have read all the erudite submission of the respective counsel in support and in opposition to the no case application.  I have formed an opinion that the first and second defendant have case to answer. Consequently the no case application is hereby dismissed and defendants should proceed to open their defense,” the justice said. However counsel to Belgore, Mr Seni Adio, a senior Advocate of Nigeria, informed the court that his client had an application asking the court to compel the prosecution to frontload the 2nd additional statement made by Dele Belgore on the 28th of March, 2017 that was not in the proof of evidence served on the defendants. In a vehement opposition, counsel to the EFCC, Rotimi Oyedepo said that the application filed since the 16th of January and was just served on the court yesterday was intended to delay the trial.
