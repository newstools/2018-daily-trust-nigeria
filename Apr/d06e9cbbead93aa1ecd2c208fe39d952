Forty six houses have been destroyed by windstorm at Kwaku village in Kuje Area Council of the FCT. A victim, Usman Ibrahim, who spoke with our reporter on Saturday at the village, said the windstorm blew roofs off houses in the area. He said his house was also affected by the windstorm and that he had to evacuate his family to a neighbour’s house. “I was in my shop attending to some customers when the windstorm started and before I realized what was happening, the roof of my house was blown off but I thank God none of my family members was injured,” he said. Another victim, Joshua Musa, said he completed roofing his house just last week and was trying to raise money to buy cement to plaster it when the windstorm blew off the roof. Our reporter observed that roof tops of some churches and mosques, primary schools and clinics were also blown off, while ECWA Church at the village collapsed completely. Meanwhile, the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has expressed shock and sadness over the incident, which he however described as a natural disaster. Galadima, who visited the community yesterday, in company of the LEA secretary of the council, Bulus Danladi and some of his aides to sympathise with those affected, urged them to see the incident as natural and assured that the council would liaise with the FCT administration to see how the victims would be assisted. The village chief of Kwaku community, Etsu Abubakar Kwaku, told the chairman that the entire community was thrown into confusion as a result of the windstorm that has rendered hundreds of people homeless since last Friday. “But we can’t query God for what has happened. He has reason for whatever happens. My house was also affected but no life was lost and nobody was injured,” he said.
