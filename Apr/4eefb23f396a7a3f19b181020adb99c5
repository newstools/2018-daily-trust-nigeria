The Kogi State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Ibrahim Sanni Muhammed, has called for domestication of anti-corruption laws across states of the federation to ensure effectiveness in the fight against graft. Muhammed, who made the call in Lokoja, at a conference of Attorneys General from Northern states with the theme: ‘Anti-Corruption Laws and Policies’, maintained that since a number of the corruption cases emanate from states, there was need for domestication of the various anti-corruption laws to enhance effective prosecution. He said the theme of the conference was to enable them to brainstorm on how to make the nation’s ant-corruption laws and policies more efficient in furtherance of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s quest to rid Nigeria of graft. According to him, the present administration in Kogi State has recruited and deployed 150 lawyers to enhance administration of criminal justice. He listed challenges hampering the administration of criminal justice in the country to include paucity of funds and lack of capacity for proper investigation by some law enforcement agencies. Another major challenge, according to him is the lack of inter-agency collaboration and rivalry between the police and the office of the Director of Public Prosecution, resulting in delays, awaiting trials and prison congestion.
