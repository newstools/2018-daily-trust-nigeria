The National Teachers’ Institute (NTI) has commenced a nationwide capacity building workshop for 876 primary and junior secondary school teachers on digital literacy, morality and HIV/AIDS under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Speaking at the flag-off of the workshop, the Director-General of the institute, Professor Garba Dahuwa Azare said that targeting teachers for the workshop was relevant as they are the catalysts of change that occurs in every dynamic society.  According to him, the twin themes of the workshop, ‘HIV/AIDS and Digital literacy’ are very germane to the global agenda of ensuring good health for all and creation of digital citizens of the world. “A healthy society equipped with digital skills will surely leap higher in the global community to be able to live a happy and productive life,” he said.  The training the teachers will receive he said is expected to have a knock-on effect on the children they teach when they share with them in the experiences of the workshop in their respective schools.  Earlier in her goodwill message, the senior special assistant to the President on SDGs, Adejoke Orelope Adefulire said that the SDGs capacity building programmes for teachers had been designed to enhance the capacity of public school teachers for more effective performance and to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education delivery, particularly in the area of digital literacy and morality education with a view to achieving the SDG objective of ‘leave no one behind’.
