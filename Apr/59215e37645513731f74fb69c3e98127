Senator Ovie Oma-Agege (APC, Delta) has been suspended for 90 legislative days over his remark that the reordered election sequence was targeted at President Muhammdu Buhari. Oma-Agege had shortly after the passage of the amendment to the 2010 Electoral Act, told newsmen that the change in the sequence was targeted at Buhari. Daily Trust recalls that Omo-Agege, with nine others: Senators Abdullahi Adamu, Malam Ali Wakili, Abu Ibrahim, Abdullahi Gumel, Binta Masi, Yahaya Abdullahi, Andrew Uchendu, Umaru Kurfi and Benjamin Uwajumogu had addressed the press where they expressed reservation over the change of elections sequence. During the briefing, Omo-Agege said, “You don’t make a law to target one person. The perception is that the law is targeted at the president. I will continue to protest it. I can tell you it will not become a law,” he said. Watch Video of Oma-Agege apologising to the Senate over his comment  Detail soon
