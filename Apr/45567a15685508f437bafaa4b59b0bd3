The Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to restrain the House of Representatives from investigating its mode of operations. The panel and its Chairman, Okoi Obono-Obla, in a suit which also joined the House Ad-hoc Committee on activities of the panel, asked the court to declare that the House’s March 22 resolution to set up the committee to investigate its “modus operandi” was tantamount to exercise of executive/supervisory power over it. In the suit instituted by Festus Keyamo (SAN) for the defendants, the court was further prayed to declare that by provisions of Section 88 of the 1999 Constitution, neither the House nor the committee is legally empowered to exercise judicial powers over it and its chairman. An affidavit attached to the suit and deposed to by one Yohanna Shankuk, a litigation clerk in Keyamo’s chambers, stated that the panel was constituted by President Muhammadu Buhari. Shankuk said the constitution of the panel was pursuant to the powers vested on the President by Section 1 of the Recovery of Public Property (Special Provisions) Act. He further deposed that the law, upon which the panel was set up and headed by the chairman, had not been repealed. The deponent maintained that the panel believed that if the court did not intervene in the matter, the House would wrongly proceed to exercise its powers under Sections 88 and 89 of the 1999 Constitution.
