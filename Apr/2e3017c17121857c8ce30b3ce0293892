The Partnership to Engage, Reform and Learn - Engage Citizen Pillar (PERL- ECP) has engaged media and civil society on electoral process preparatory to the 2019 general election. The Northeast Regional Team Leader of PERL-ECP, Mrs Elizabeth Sara, said the meeting was to help citizens achieve good governance through effective use of the political process. She said Nigerian democracy could still not stand because of poor understanding of the electoral Process. “Through this partnership, it’s expected that the media, CSOs and all other stakeholders would identify the key political issues and educate the electorate ahead of the 2019 general election,” she said. She warned the media and Civil society organizations against partisan politics, saying, “It’s your responsibility to help them analyse on the key burning issues and how to change them to achieve good governance.” Also speaking, a media consultant from University of Maiduguri, Dr Ahmed Baidu, said at the end of the meeting, both the media and the CSOs would understand how well they could work together to influence free, fair and credible election. At the end of the meeting, the forum observed how problem of marginalization of women, youths, and persons with disability had always been next to candidate imposition by political leadership in the state.
