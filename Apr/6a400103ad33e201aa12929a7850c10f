The Pope has called for an end to the “carnage” in Syria during his Easter message from the Vatican. He also asked God to heal the wounds in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and urged dialogue on the Korean peninsula. Pope Francis said the power of the Christian message gave hope to the deprived. This included migrants and refugees who he said were “so often rejected by today’s culture of waste.” Thousands of people were in St Peter’s Square to hear him speak from the balcony of the basilica. “Today we implore fruits of peace upon the entire world, beginning with the beloved and long suffering land of Syria whose people are worn down by an apparently endless war,” said the Pope.
