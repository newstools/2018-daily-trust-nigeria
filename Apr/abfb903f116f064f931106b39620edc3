A group, the Northern Emancipation Network (NEN) has advocated the principle of generational shift in deciding who represents Kaduna-Central senatorial zone in the Senate from 2019. Coordinator of the group, Malam Abdulazeez Suleiman, in a statement said his group is calling on stakeholders and all people in the zone to support the aspiration of Alhaji Lawal Adamu, known as LA for the seat in order to allow the youth contribute their quota to the development of the state. Suleiman said LA, who recently indicated interest in running for the chairmanship of Kaduna North Local Government but opted out should heed the call of the people to run for a higher office in the comingÂ  elections in the state.
