Armenia’s National Assembly has sworn in a new prime minister after days of protests against him. Demonstrators object to the former president, Serzh Sargsyan, becoming the new premier. Opposition MP Nikol Pashinyan said the protests constitute a “non-violent velvet revolution”. “We must paralyse the entire state system and the power should pass to the people,” he told protesters in the capital Yerevan. “Serzh Sargsyan must see that he has no Armenia to rule in and no people to rule over.” Mr Pashinyan earlier urged protesters in Yerevan and in other cities to blockade state institutions. Demonstrators in the capital proceeded to cordon off the interior ministry and the prosecutor’s office, though police prevented them from entering the parliament where legislators confirmed Mr Sargsyan as prime minister. People are also reportedly gathering to demonstrate in the cities of Gyumri and Vanadzor.
