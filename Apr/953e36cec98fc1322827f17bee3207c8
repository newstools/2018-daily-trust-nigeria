The kidnappers of Abaji Area Council’s Local Education Authority (LEA) acting secretary, Adabakpa Umar Ugbada, have demanded N20 million ransom from his family. A family source, who preferred anonymity, said the kidnappers have been communicating with one of his family members about the ransom. He said the abductors called the same day they abducted the acting secretary and asked the family to raise the ransom before they will release him and the woman in their captivity. “The family has been devastated since the LEA secretary was kidnapped. They called one of us demanding for N20 million ransom before he and the woman will be released,” the source said. He said the family is confused on how to raise the money. “When we appealed to the kidnappers to reduce the amount, they immediately switched off the phone,” the source added. The source said amidst their travails, thieves still invaded one of their houses and stole heaps of yam brought in from the farm. When contacted, the spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manza, did not pick calls put across to him. He also did not reply to text messages sent to his phone. Mr Ugbada was kidnapped along with a middle-aged woman along Atako-Rubochi road while returning to Gwargwada village in Kuje Area Council, at the close of work at about 5:00p.m. on the fateful day.
