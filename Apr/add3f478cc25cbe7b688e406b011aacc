The British Council and a local body, Managing Conflict in North East Nigeria (MCN), have trained traditional rulers, their wives and scribes on dispute resolution through record keeping and respect for human rights in Fika and Damaturu emirates of Yobe State. The state team leader of the MCN, Mr Abdulkadir Sambo, stated this during a workshop organised for the traditional rulers in Damaturu. Sambo said the training received by the traditional rulers would also provide them with knowledge on human rights, gender mainstreaming in reconciliation and mediation process. “Over 70 percent of disputes are handled by non-formal sector. Considering their importance, we tried to strengthen their interface with the formal sector like police and Judiciary so that simple issues are not left to escalate into violence. We now have trained 160 traditional rulers, 160 scribes and 50 wives of the traditional rulers knowing their importance in resolving disputes on marital affairs, children up-bringing and home keeping,” he said. He explained that Fika and Damaturu emirates were selected to pilot the programme before rolling out the second phase, in Gashua, Gaidam and Potiskum emirates. He called on the beneficiaries to step down the lesson learnt from the programme to their colleagues who were not able to attend “Because both the emirates have over 1000 traditional rulers each.” A consultant of Green Horizon, Mrs Hadiza Bukar, said the participants were trained on how they could record data and have the statistics of crimes in their communities. “This would help them to know whether or not the level of crime has reduced to enhance reconciliation and stability within their domains, in particular those affected by displacement,” she said.
