Kwara State Governor, Dr. Abdulfatah Ahmed, has vowed to procure additional Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC) to beef up security in Offa and strategic locations across the state. The governor who urged well-meaning citizens of the state to resist any attempt by anyone to use the unfortunate Offa robbery attack for political purposes, said this during swearing-in of a new Khadi of the state’s Shariah Court of Appeal, Hon. Mas'ud Adebayo Oniye. The governor frowned at utterances made to score political gain, pointing out that "those utterances do not reflect our values as Kwarans and should stop, out of respect for the dead and the injured”. Ahmed assured Kwarans that government will do everything within its power to ensure that the good people of Offa and Kwara State never experience such a tragedy again. According to him, "For the avoidance of doubt, let me reassure Kwarans and indeed all Nigerians that the culprits will be apprehended and brought to justice swiftly. "Presently, the police and other security agencies in the country have begun a vigorous manhunt for the perpetrators of the dastardly and horrid attack on the peaceful and industrious people of Offa". Governor Ahmed advised that "our people must be vigilant and security conscious as part of community involvement in effective policing".
