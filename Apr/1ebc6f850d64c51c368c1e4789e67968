Chairman of the Senate committee on Public Accounts, Senator Mathew Urhoghide (PDP, Edo) said his call for the impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over extra budgetary expenditure stands. Urhoghide had moved that section 143 of the 1999 Constitution be invoked during plenary session last Thursday. He was attacked by irate youths at the Benin Airport, Edo state over his call for Buhari’s impeachment. The lawmaker had during a debate on the $496m expended by the President on purchase of Super Tucano aircraft without the nod of the National Assembly, suggested that the impeachment proceedings of the President should commence. On social media yesterday, it went viral that Urhoghide had recanted the statement. But in a statement last night he faulted the report. “With the current state of affairs in our nation, I stand by my comments made on the floor of the Senate Plenary on Thursday that the Constitution must be followed to the letter,” he said.
