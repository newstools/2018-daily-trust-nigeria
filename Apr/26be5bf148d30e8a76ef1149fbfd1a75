About 10 senators fought in a closed session presided over by Senate President Bukola Saraki over issues bordering on what they tagged as ‘clampdown’ by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)’. It also emerged at the session that the EFCC has commenced scrutiny of bank details of many senators following allegation of financial misconduct. Daily Trust gathered that the issue dominated the closed session of the Senate that lasted for about three hours yesterday. The session which started by 10.56am ended around 1.36pm. Senators told our correspondent that at the session about 10 senators confirmed that the anti graft agencies had accessed their bank statement for scrutiny. A senator said, “The issue started when a senator from a Northwest state stood up and accused one of our colleagues from Northeast of being the one that submitted his name for probe. The issue charged the session. It was at this moment that others spoke on it.” He said other senators including two from the southeast confirmed that their bank details was being analysed by the EFCC. Also speaking on the closed session, a northwest senator said their northeast colleague was accused of being the agent of the EFCC at the Senate. “About 10 of our colleagues raised the issue that their bankers have intimated them that their bank statements are being scrutinized,” he said. It was gathered that the issue led to argument between the accused northeast senator and other lawmakers. Daily Trust gathered that the issue of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi (PDP, Delta) was also raised. Nwaoboshi has been in the EFCC custody since last week. “Nwaoboshi was arrested since last Tuesday. The EFCC secured the order to detain him in a crafty way. They went to the court with Peter Nwaoboshi without including senator on the court order,” he said. Three senators also confirmed that Nwaoboshi told them that the EFCC has secured detention order to arrest two former governors from Northwest, who are serving senators.
