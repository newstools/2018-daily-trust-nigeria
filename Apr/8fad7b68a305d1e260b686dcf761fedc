Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku of Taraba State is to build a new government house for the state. Ishaku gave this indication yesterday in Jalingo after inspecting the site of the project, saying he felt that the state needed a befitting government house and that as an architect, he was in the best position to give the state the edifice that would serve as the state seat of power. He said construction would start as soon as government was able raise funds. “With a vision that has already matured, when we have money, we will deploy it into the project,” he said, adding that his visit to the proposed site was part of planning for the project.
