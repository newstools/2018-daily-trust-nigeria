Students from Ekiti State at the Adekunke Ajasin University Akungba (AAUA), Ondo State, have rejected the new fees introduced by the authorities of the university, describing them as too high and unacceptable. The students said that the authorities did not consider the current economic realities before arriving at the current regime of fees, and urged reversal to the old fees. The students delegation made up of eight and led by Mr. Sunday Olumide Omojoja said they came as a delegation of Federation of Ekiti Students Union (FESSU), AAUA chapter. They appealed to the Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) and the Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Amos Igbekele Ajibefun, “to look kindly into the hike in fees with a view to reversing them. Omojola said the leadership of the students union in the institution had spoken on the fees, saying, “We adopt the stand of our student leaders that there should be no increment in the fees of returning students, while we agree that freshers should be made to pay a 30 per cent increment.”
