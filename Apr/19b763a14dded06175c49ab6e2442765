The FCT sector command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has said it is prosecuting eight motorists in court for allegedly offering bribes to marshals on AYA-Nyanya route. The Sector Commander, Ayuba G. Wobin, who stated this in an interview with City News in his office yesterday, said the eight motorists were charged to court separately in the last two weeks. “I want people to know that the person you are offering bribe to may not be the person that is yearning for bribe; you give him, he collects it and then he books you, then we give you a court summon to come and explain why you want to corrupt our official on duty,” he said. He, however, said there were bad eggs in the corps who sometimes negotiated for bribe. “I won’t say we don’t have those that accept bribe, but we have our books and such officers will be shown the way out when caught. “That practice has been in existence from inception of the FRSC and it will continue till some of us retire and even the ones coming after us. I am very sure they will continue on that path because it is the laid down procedure that must be followed,” he added. He said the command usually sent people out on surveillance to monitor the way officers of the corps behaved on the roads. “It is not only the issue of extortion that the surveillance team go out for; they check your attitude, your behaviour to motorists on the road. Action can also be taken against you if you are not polite. “On the issue of extortion, there are no two ways about: that if you are caught, you will be investigated and afterwards sent out of the corps because it is not your type that we want,” he stated.
