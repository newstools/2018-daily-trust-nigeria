A commercial cyclist, identified as Abdulazeez, has been allegedly stabbed to death by suspected motorcycle snatchers at Phase III in Gwagwalada. A resident of the area, Kabiru Danjuma, said the incident happened at about 10:00p.m. on Monday when the deceased conveyed two passengers from the market to Phase III. He said the passengers allegedly stabbed the cyclist with a knife at a lonely spot close to Phase III and fled with the motorcycle. He said another cyclist saw the corpse and raised alarm that attracted the attention of some members of the motorcycle union who came with the police to the scene. “They came and saw the corpse, which they later took to University of Abuja Teaching Hospital mortuary,” he said When contacted, the Gwagwalada Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP Chuks Obasi, didn’t pick calls nor did he return a text message sent to his phone. The FCT police command spokesman, Anjuguri Manzah, also didn’t pick nor reply a text message sent to him.
