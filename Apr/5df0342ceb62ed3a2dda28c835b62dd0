The National Centre for Women Development (NCWD) yesterday flagged off a residential capacity building training for 140 female artisans. This was part of the 2017 Federal Government intervention project. The three weeks programme would train girls and women between the ages of 18 to 35 years from across the 36 states including FCT. Participants would be trained in plumbing and piping, generating set repairs and maintenance, air conditioning and refrigeration and tiling and masonry. The Director General (NCWD) Mary Ekpere-Eta during the flag-off said, the projects was aimed at equipping beneficiaries to break the cycle of stereotype around the ability of females to do well in non-traditional trades and also empower them to become change agents in their respective communities.
