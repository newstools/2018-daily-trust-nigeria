President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Waba has warned that the much clamoured Universal Health Coverage (UHC) would not be attained without a motivated health workforce. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) means making healthcare accessible to people without financial hardships. He stated this yesterday during the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the West Africa Health Sector Union (WAHSUN) in Abuja. He said no system could improve its healthcare services without taking into consideration the welfare of healthcare workers. “Machines can only give results, but we must use human beings to be able to deliver on quality health services, especially, Universal Health Coverage, UHC,” he said. Waba enjoined African leaders to give maximum consideration to the welfare of health workers across the region, and to strengthen the health system in order to reduce medical tourism.
