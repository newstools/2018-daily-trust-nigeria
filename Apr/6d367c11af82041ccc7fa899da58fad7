Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said President Muhammadu Buhari appointed God fearing Christians in his cabinet, calling on Christian faithfuls in the country to pray earnestly for the success of his administration.

Addressing Christians at a thanksgiving service to celebrate the 50th birthday of the senator representing Adamawa North, Senator Binta Masi Garba held today at Supernatural God Ministry in Yola, Osinbajo said religious leaders have a role to play in making government appointees successful.

"We are in the period of history where God wants to do something for us, that is why we are in government.

"Every appointee who made positive impact in government was supported by the prayers of men of God in this country. 

"We want you to sit down and pray for the future of this country because what we leave behind is what is important for the people,‚Äù he stated.
