The Lagos State police command has warned residents of the state to be wary of where they seek medical attention. The advice followed the arrest of a fake medical practitioner, Abdulrahman Mohammed, who had allegedly been practising for over four years at the Mushin area of the state. The Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, said 39-year-old Mohammed, who hails from Ran village in the Gambaru Ngala Local Government Area of Bornu State, was operating as a medical doctor at No. 3, Bemisiele Street, Idi-Araba, before he was arrested on a tip-off. Edgal said the suspect claimed that he stopped his education at primary school level but had no certificate to show that he attended any primary school. He said, “Investigation into the activities of Mohammed who had been impersonating as a medical doctor for the past four years revealed he had been practising administering intravenous injections, conducting medical test on his patients and taking urine and blood samples from them. “He has confessed that he buys his drugs from Idumota market, Lagos Island. We recovered a blood pressure reading machine, both manual and electronic types; syringes, drip packs and both saline and sugar solution etc. He will soon be charged to court.” Mohammed told journalists he was not a medical doctor and didn’t treat patients. “I only sell drugs and help people to check their blood pressure. If I like a person, I can help him or her to check his/her blood level or to check any disease,” he said.
