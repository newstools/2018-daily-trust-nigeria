Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has expressed confidence that Nigeria is on the path of resurrection and progress. Osinbajo was speaking to State House correspondents on Sunday after attending a church service to commemorate the Easter celebration at the Aso Rock Villa Chapel, Abuja. The vice president also stated that the country was moving from its current challenges to greater hope, peace and prosperity. ''The resurrection of Jesus Christ is also a strong and powerful message to the nation. ''The message is that our nation is on the path of resurrection, it is on the path of progress, it is on the path of elevation. ''We are moving out from all our challenges and we are going to a place of greater hope, peace and prosperity and abundance for all of us," the vice president stated. In his sermon on "The Temporary Hour of Darkness", the chaplain of the Aso Villa Chapel, Pastor Seyi Malomo, said Nigeria's problems would be over. The cleric admonished all Nigerians to play their role of making sacrifices that would usher in the country's liberation and greatness. He said: ''According to the message today (Sunday), darkness only reigns for a while. No matter the evil, the problems we are facing, just as Jesus only laid in the grave for three days, all these will be over. ''As long as Jesus rose from the dead, we are going to rise again, even all of you listening to me. In terms of sacrifice, we have to emulate the life of Jesus Christ. He sacrificed for mankind, and we are liberated and celebrating because he paid the sacrifice."
