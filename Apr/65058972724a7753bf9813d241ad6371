Ekiti State government has put the total cost of the Fajuyi-Ojumose 1.3-kilometer overhead bridge in Ado Ekiti at N6.4billion. The Commissioner for Finance, Chief Toyin Ojo who stated this in a statement, on Wednesday, said that the amount was far below the figures being peddled about as the cost of the bridge. Giving a breakdown of the expenditure,  Ojo said that the cost increased from the initial estimate of N5.2billion to N6.4billion to accommodate additional expenses that were not captured in the initial budget for the project. He highlighted the supplementary works on the project to include extension of the bridge, beautification of the area, construction of alternative roads as well as payment of compensation to owners of properties that gave way for the project. Describing the project as part of the development and urbanisation scheme of the Fayose- led administration, Ojo stressed that the bridge would ease traffic flow and decrease time wasted by commuters on the road and eliminate unnecessary stress. The commissioner appealed to the Federal Government to refund the expenses incurred by the state government for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of federal roads in the state. He said the state had filed all necessary documents with the Federal Ministry of Works, but lamented that like most states in the federation; Ekiti was under dire financial constraints and would appreciate a quick refund of all outstanding money owed the state to enable the state government to fulfill its obligations to the people. He however  assured that the state government would continue to work relentlessly towards improving the lots of the people in spite of economic impediments. Disclosing that the state had set a benchmark of N400 million as its monthly Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), the commissioner assured that all funds would be judiciously utilised, stressing that the present administration in the state, abhor extra-budget spending.
