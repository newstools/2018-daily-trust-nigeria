The trial of former FCT Minister, Senator Bala Mohammed on allegations of fraud before an FCT High Court in Gudu, Abuja has been adjourned to June 19. Mohammed was arraigned on May 10, 2017 by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a six-count charge bordering on abuse of office, false declaration of assets and fraud to the tune of N864million. Before this adjournment, Daily Trust reports that on October 17 when the trial was scheduled to commence, the case was adjourned to December 4 at the instance of the defence. Counsel representing the defendant on that day told the court that the lead counsel, Chief Chris Uche (SAN) was bereaved and that the defendant was absent in court due to stomach problem he had as a result of food poison. While the trial started on December 4 with the prosecution calling its first witness, the trial judge adjourned the matter to February 12 for further cross-examination of the witness. When the matter resumed on February 12 and the cross-examination was concluded, the court, at the instance of the prosecution adjourned the case to April 16. Although the defendant was in court yesterday, the matter could not go as the court did not sit for proceedings. Court officials said the trial judge, Justice Abubakar Talba was indisposed hence a new date was agreed with the counsels for the trial to continue. Daily Trust reports that Section 396 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), 2015 provided that upon arraignment, the trial of the defendant shall proceed from day-to-day until the conclusion of the trial. Adding that, where day-to-day trial is impracticable, the parties shall be entitled to only five adjournments each and the interval between each adjournment shall not exceed two weeks each.
