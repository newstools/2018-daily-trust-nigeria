A Sharia court sitting at Magajin Gari, Kaduna State, on Monday  ordered that one Shuaibu Umar is given 80 strokes of cane for calling  his sister-in-law, Suwaiba Abdulkadir, a prostitute. Abdulkadir, who had filed a case of defamation against her  brother-in-law, told the court that Umar called her a prostitute after a  misunderstanding they had. “Shuaibu is my husband’s younger brother and we had a misunderstanding; we exchanged words and he called me a prostitute. “I want this honourable court to grant me justice, as what my brother-in-law said about me has tarnished my image,” she said. The defendant, who did not deny calling his sister-in-law a prostitute, added that he spoke in anger and had no regrets. “I was hurt when she called me a drug addict and a thief; that was  why I called her a prostitute and I won’t go back on my words,” he said. The judge, Mallam Dahiru Lawal, ruled that Umar be given 80 lashes of  cane after giving him a chance to withdraw his statement, which he  refused to do. “The defendant confirmed calling his sister-in-law a prostitute and  is not ready to withdraw the statement; therefore, I, Dahiru Lawal, rule  that Shuaibu Umar be given 80 strokes of cane. “This is in accordance with the teachings of Prophet Muhammad which  state that one cannot accuse a person of adultery or fornication except  he presents four witnesses who have seen the activity. “He is to receive 80 strokes of cane in place of the person he  accused because he has defamed the person’s character,” the judge ruled.
