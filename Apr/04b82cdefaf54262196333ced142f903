The Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC) and the Department of Development Control had cleared what they said to be illegal structures along the Outer Southern Expressway (ONEX) from Mpape Junction down to Kubwa  expressway. The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) agencies said most of the structures removed were car stands, food vendors’ kiosks, road side mechanics and building materials traders whose activities cause obstructions along the highway. While speaking with journalists in Abuja, the Coordinator Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC) Umar Shuaibu, said Abuja as a world class city needs to be sanitized and kept free from all nuisance. “There are car stands provided for these car sellers and we expect them to abide by the laws by relocating there not displaying their goods along the main road. We want all the corridors of the road to be free from obstruction so we expect that each person will go back to the appropriate place to do his business,’’ he said. Shuaibu added that there would also be a pin down security to watch over the cleared areas so that the people wouldn’t get the chance to come back to display their goods, adding that a mobile court was also available for any defaulter to be charged when apprehended.
