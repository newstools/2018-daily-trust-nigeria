The Chairman of Kwali Area Council, Mr. Joseph K. Shazin, has expressed his administration’s determination to eradicate poliomyelitis across the council. Shazin, who stated this at the end of a review meeting of the ongoing Immunization Plus days exercise in Kwali on Saturday, said he was impressed with compliance among parents. He added that the enlightenment and sensitization carried out by traditional rulers had helped parents to cooperate with health officials. “And we have also seen improvement from the Fulani who have earlier rejected the polio immunization, and I believe our traditional rulers’ efforts made them to  now comply,” he said. The chairman said the council has approved  the purchase of 10 motorcycles for  immunization officers to ensure total coverage of the council during the exercise. Speaking earlier, the FCT Director Primary Health Care Board, Dr. Isah Yahaya Vatsa, said the  administration recognized the tremendous contributions of the Kwali chairman in his effort in the fight against poliomyelitis in the territory. City News reports that  health officials would be visiting mosques, churches, market places and other public places to immunize children between the ages of zero to 59 months in the four-day Immunization Plus exercise in all the 62 political wards of the FCT.
