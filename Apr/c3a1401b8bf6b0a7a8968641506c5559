President Muhammadu Buhari has called on the leadership of the Jama’atu Izalatil Bid’ah Wa’ikamatis Sunnah (JIBWIS) with its headquarters in Jos, Plateau State, to pursue with all vigour the establishment of a university to complement the group’s efforts in the education sector. Buhari, who was represented by the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, threw the challenge yesterday at the annual Islamic convention, appeal fund launch and book presentation of the group held at the Eagle Square, Abuja. Buhari said that with over 6,000 schools and over 7,000 students studying at primary to diploma levels spread across the country, the JIBWIS’ appeal for fund needed positive response from all donors as no nation would progress without education, both western and religious. Earlier, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar (III) who was represented by the Emir of Keffi, Dr. Shehu Chindo Yamusa III as chairman of the occasion, acknowledged the effort of JIBWIS in the establishment of schools to spread knowledge, and urged the Islamic group to establish a university to train doctors, especially women doctors, to better handle female patients as required by Islam. In his remark, the National Chairman, Ulama Council of the group, Ash-Sheikh Muhammad Sani Yahaya Jingir,  said JIBWIS had recorded successes in educating Muslims in Nigeria and some neighbouring countries against ignorance, tribalism and undue disagreements. He said the N350 million appeal fund of the association was for the construction of conference hall and library, purchase of office equipment and operational vehicles.
